Abstract = {{Although reforestation is frequently utilized in many Mediterranean
   Basin countries to restore burned Mediterranean pine woodlands,
   post-fire recovery of the plant community is often neglected. To compare
   the post-fire recovery of the plant community following active and
   indirect post-fire restoration techniques, we studied three post-fire
   regeneration treatments in a salvage-logged Pinus brutia forest,
   including two active (plantation and seeding) restoration techniques and
   one indirect (natural regeneration). An unburned pine stand was also
   included in the study. We applied the point-intercept method to obtain
   data on the presence and cover of individual species and functional
   groups in six replicate one-hectare plots for each treatment. We found
   no significant differences in plant species richness among post-fire
   treatments; however, plant community composition and vegetation
   structure were significantly different between treatments. There was a
   shift in plant community structure when active restoration techniques
   were applied, from the woody-and resprouter-dominated plant community of
   the unburned site to an annual herbaceous-and non-resprouter-dominated
   one. Our results suggest that active restoration by planting tree
   saplings in Mediterranean pine forests after a fire may decrease the
   plant community's resilience and provide empirical evidence that pine
   plantation treatments change the plant species composition of these
   forests. These results have important implications for post-fire
   management of Mediterranean Basin pine forests.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean area, different post-fire management strategies are
   used for coppices of resprouting species to promote a more regular
   forest structure, enhance plant growth, and reduce fire risk. However,
   the effects of these management treatments on forest-associated fauna
   are unknown, which in turn could be limiting their beneficial effects.
   The aim of this work was to determine whether forest management of a
   recently burned area dominated by a vigorous resprouting tree species
   (Arbutus unedo L.) affects ant communities.
   Ant communities, sampled using pitfall traps, were examined from
   unmanaged and selective thinning coppices of A. unedo. Ants are here
   used as bioindicators of ecosystem health and surrogates for other
   animal groups.
   Very limited effects of these post-fire management strategies on the
   structure and composition of ant communities were found. The lack of
   effects could be due to the reported small changes in physical
   conditions among treatments; or either, the most sensitive ant species
   to these post-fire management treatments might be the same ones affected
   by fire and, consequently, the ant species that would potentially be
   affected most were no longer in the study area.
   The lack of any significant effects caused by these post-fire management
   practices on the associated fauna of A. unedo coppices points out the
   suitability of these treatments in these circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{As many other Mediterranean ecosystems, Aleppo pine forests are
   generally considered highly resilient to fire. Since spatial
   heterogeneity may be important in determining post-disturbance community
   structure and function, a main question to address concerns the
   resilience of plant spatial pattern to fire disturbance. In this work,
   vegetation spatial data from Aleppo pine forests of Southeast Spain were
   analysed. Post-fire plant cover showed a clumped spatial distribution,
   which may be related to the locations of the burned pine trees. Point
   pattern analysis revealed a strong resilience of plant pattern after
   disturbance. Plant-soil interactions may explain the post-fire spatial
   pattern of plant cover. The results indicate that Aleppo pine forests
   may promote resource-island patterns that persist after fire disturbance
   and determine post-fire recovery.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the combined effects of heterogeneity of
   pre-fire forest cover and vegetation burn severity on post-fire
   vegetation density and regeneration at an early stage in Samcheok,
   Korea. To measure the spatial heterogeneity of pre-fire forests, spatial
   pattern metrics at a landscape level and class level were adopted, and a
   regression tree analysis for post-fire vegetation density and
   regeneration was used to avoid spatial autocorrelation. Two regression
   tree models were estimated for post-fire vegetation density and
   post-fire vegetation regeneration with the same independent variable
   sets, including heterogeneity of pre-fire forest cover and vegetation
   burn severity. The estimated model suggested that the percentage of
   Japanese red pine and burn severity were the most significant variables
   for post-fire vegetation density and regeneration, respectively. The
   compositional and spatial heterogeneity of pre-fire forest and burn
   severity, as well as the degree of burn severity, was found to have
   significant impacts on post-fire vegetation density and regeneration.
   Overall, more rapid vegetation regeneration can be expected in more
   severely burned areas. However, this rapid vegetation regeneration at an
   early stage is due mostly to perennials and shrubs, not to the sprouting
   or regrowth of trees. The study results strongly indicated that a
   susceptible forest cover type and its spatial patterns directly
   influence the heterogeneity of burn severity and early vegetation
   density and regeneration. Hence, the management of susceptible forest
   cover types is particularly critical for establishing more
   fire-resilient forests and for post-fire forest restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires, which constitute the most extensive natural disturbance of
   the boreal biome, produce a broad range of ecological impacts to
   vegetation and soils that may influence post-fire vegetation assemblies
   and seedling recruitment. We inventoried post-fire understory vascular
   plant communities and tree seedling recruitment in the northwestern
   Canadian boreal forest and characterized the relative importance of fire
   effects and fire history, as well as non-fire drivers (i.e., the
   topoedaphic context and climate), to post-fire vegetation assemblies.
   Topoedaphic context, pre-fire forest structure and composition, and
   climate primarily controlled the understory plant communities and shifts
   in the ranked dominance of tree species ({*}{*}{*}8\% and {*}{*}13\% of
   variance explained, respectively); however, fire and fire-affected soils
   were significant secondary drivers of post-fire vegetation. Wildfire had
   a significant indirect effect on understory vegetation communities
   through post-fire soil properties ({*}{*}5\%), and fire history and burn
   severity explained the dominance shifts of tree species ({*}7\%).
   Fire-related variables were important explanatory variables in
   classification and regression tree models explaining the dominance
   shifts of four tree species (R-2 = 0.43-0.65). The dominance of jack
   pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides
   Michx.) increased following fires, whereas that of black spruce (Picea
   mariana (Mill.) BSP.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss)
   declined. The overriding importance of site and climate to post-fire
   vegetation assemblies may confer some resilience to disturbed forests;
   however, if projected increases in fire activity in the northwestern
   boreal forest are borne out, secondary pathways of burn severity, fire
   frequency, and fire effects on soils are likely to accelerate ongoing
   climate-driven shifts in species compositions.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing wildfires in western North American conifer forests have led
   to debates surrounding the application of post-fire management
   practices. There is a lack of consensus on whether (and to what extent)
   post-fire management assists or hinders managers in achieving goals,
   particularly in under-studied regions like eastern ponderosa pine
   forests. This makes it difficult for forest managers to balance among
   competing interests. We contrast structural and community
   characteristics across unburned ponderosa pine forest, severely burned
   ponderosa pine forest, and severely burned ponderosa pine forest treated
   with post-fire management with respect to three management objectives:
   ponderosa pine regeneration, wildland fuels control, and habitat
   conservation. Ponderosa pine saplings were more abundant in treated
   burned sites than untreated burned sites, suggesting increases in tree
   regeneration following tree planting; however, natural regeneration was
   evident in both unburned and untreated burned sites. Wildland fuels
   management greatly reduced snags and coarse woody debris in treated
   burned sites. Understory cover measurements revealed bare ground and
   fine woody debris were more strongly associated with untreated burned
   sites, and greater levels of forbs and grass were more strongly
   associated with treated burned sites. Wildlife habitat was greatly
   reduced following post-fire treatments. There were no tree cavities in
   treated burned sites, whereas untreated burned sites had an average of
   27 +/- 7.68 cavities per hectare. Correspondingly, we found almost
   double the avian species richness in untreated burned sites compared to
   treated burned sites (22 species versus 12 species). Unburned forests
   and untreated burned areas had the same species richness, but hosted
   unique avian communities. Our results indicate conflicting outcomes with
   respect to management objectives, most evident in the clear costs to
   habitat conservation following post-fire management application.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the increase in wood demand, the reduction in the

   harvesting, along with the general perception that wildfires create
   ecological disasters, have favoured an increase in salvage logging in

   these post-fire forests may represent important habitats for several
   wildlife species and that intensive salvage logging, by removing
   standing snags, has several impacts on wildlife. However, the effects of
   salvage logging on biodiversity have yet to be considered in post-fire
   management plans. We examine the issue of salvage logging for wildlife
   in the boreal forest, with particular reference to Quebec as an example.
   We describe our current state of knowledge on the use of burned forests
   by some wildlife and on the impacts of salvage logging on these
   habitats. We conclude that snag retention at multiple spatial and
   temporal scales in recent burns, which will be salvage-logged, is a
   prescription that must be implemented to meet the principles of

Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of natural and human disturbances on forest
   biota is critical for improving forest management. Many studies have
   examined the separate impacts on fauna and flora of wildfire,
   conventional logging, and salvage logging, but empirical comparisons
   across a broad gradient of simultaneous disturbances are lacking. We
   quantified species richness and frequency of occurrence of vascular
   plants, and functional group responses, across a gradient of
   disturbances that occurred concurrently in 2009 in the mountain ash
   forests of southeastern Australia. Our study encompassed replicated
   sites in undisturbed forest (similar to 70 yr post fire), forest burned
   at low severity, forest burned at high severity, unburned forest that
   was clearcut logged, and forest burned at high severity that was
   clearcut salvage logged post-fire. All sites were sampled 2 and 3 yr
   post fire. Mean species richness decreased across the disturbance
   gradient from 30.1 species/site on low-severity burned sites and 28.9
   species/site on high-severity burned sites, to 25.1 species/site on
   clearcut sites and 21.7 species/site on salvage logged sites.
   Low-severity burned sites were significantly more species-rich than
   clearcut sites and salvage logged sites; high-severity burned sites
   supported greater species richness than salvage logged sites. Specific
   traits influenced species' sensitivity to disturbance. Resprouting
   species dominated undisturbed mountain ash forests, but declined
   significantly across the gradient. Fern and midstory trees decreased
   significantly in frequency of occurrence across the gradient. Ferns
   (excluding bracken) decreased from 34\% of plants in undisturbed forest
   to 3\% on salvage logged sites. High-severity burned sites supported a
   greater frequency of occurrence and species richness of midstory trees
   compared to clearcut and salvage logged sites. Salvage logging supported
   fewer midstory trees than any other disturbance category, and were
   distinctly different from clearcut sites. Plant life form groups,
   including midstory trees, shrubs, and ferns, were dominated by very few
   species on logged sites. The differences in biotic response across the
   gradient of natural and human disturbances have significant management
   implications, particularly the need to reduce mechanical disturbance
   overall and to leave specific areas with no mechanical disturbance
   across the cut area during logging operations, to ensure the persistence
   of resprouting taxa.}},

Title = {{Does post-fire salvage logging affect foraging activity by rodents?}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Following wildfires, salvage logging is applied for silvicultural,
   safety or even aesthetic reasons. Such operations impact on biological
   legacies, impair natural vegetation recovery and may affect several
   animal species that depend on vegetation structure and specific plant
   resources. Rodents, such as wood and Algerian mice, use vegetation cover
   as protection against predators and are important prey, moderately
   effective seed dispersers and efficient seed predators. Different
   post-fire management strategies may either promote rodent abundance,
   enhancing their key biological roles, or result in low rodent abundance,
   creating a low seed predation window of opportunity when assisted
   regeneration of burnt forests is required. In order to evaluate the
   effects of post-fire salvage logging on plant-animal interactions, we
   compared plant regeneration, the availability of trophic resources
   (seeds and fleshy fruits), rodent foraging activity and rodent relative
   abundance between unlogged and logged burnt pine forests in the
   north-eastern Iberian Peninsula at different distances (up to 700 m)
   from the burnt area perimeter. The results show that vegetation
   recovered more slowly in salvage logged than in unlogged areas. Foraging
   activity of rodents increased both with the volume of woody debris,
   mainly derived from salvage logging, and with increasing foliage cover.
   Management strategies aimed at promoting the presence of rodents and

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Disturbance such as wildfire may create opportunities for plant
   communities to reorganize in response to climate change. The interaction
   between climate change and disturbance may be particularly important in
   forests, where many of the foundational plant species (trees) are
   long-lived and where poor initial tree establishment can result in
   conversion to shrub- or graminoid-dominated systems. The response of
   post-disturbance vegetation establishment to post-disturbance weather
   conditions, particularly to extreme weather, could therefore provide
   useful information about how forest communities will respond to climate
   change. We examined the effect of post-fire weather conditions on
   post-fire tree, shrub, and graminoid recruitment in fire-adapted forests
   in northern California, USA, by surveying regenerating vegetation in
   severely burned areas 4-5 yr after 14 different wildfires that burned
   between 2004 and 2012. This time period (2004-2016) encompassed a wide
   range of post-fire weather conditions, including a period of extreme
   drought. For the most common tree species, we observed little evidence
   of disturbance-mediated community reorganization or range shifts but
   instead either (1) low sensitivity of recruitment to post-fire weather
   or (2) weak but widespread decreases in recruitment under unusually dry
   post-fire conditions, depending on the species. The occurrence of a
   single strong drought year following fire was more important than a
   series of moderately dry years in explaining tree recruitment declines.
   Overall, however, post-fire tree recruitment patterns were explained
   more strongly by long-term climate and topography and local adult tree
   species abundance than by post-fire weather conditions. This observation
   suggests that surviving adult trees can contribute to a ``biological
   inertia{''} that restricts the extent to which tree community
   composition will track changes in climate through post-disturbance
   recruitment. In contrast to our observations in trees, we observed
   substantial increases in shrub and graminoid establishment under
   post-fire drought, suggesting that shifts in dominance between
   functional groups may become more likely in a future with more frequent
   and intense drought.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Adaptive forest management requires scientific knowledge about
   post-fire vegetation dynamics, mainly on initial and transitional
   stages. We hypothesized that management practices are as important as
   the timing of the operations themselves, with respect to diversity and
   species composition of the understorey post-fire regenerated Pious
   halepensis forests.
   Location: Two post-fire regenerated P. halepensis stands burned in 1994
   under contrasting climatic conditions (Dry -595 mm.yr(-1)- and Semi-arid
   - 340 mm.yr(-1) - sites) in southeast Spain.
   Methods: At both sites, we set experimental plots to test early
   treatments, including removal of the understorey vegetation (scrubbing,
   at post-fire year 5), thinning (at post-fire years 5 and 10) and control
   plots. Alpha diversity indices, including species richness, Shannon
   diversity index and plant cover, as a measure of vegetation abundance,
   and beta diversity indices, such as Jaccard index and non-metric
   multidimensional scaling were diachronically analysed at post-fire years
   5 (before the treatments) and 16.
   Results: At both sites, the most abundant species were obligate seeders
   or grass resprouters. Low overlap in the occurrence of species was also
   found between sites on both dates, but the number of shared species
   increased by the end of the study period. Significant differences in the
   diversity indices were detected between sites. Despite the silvicultural
   treatments, the species richness and Shannon diversity index values at
   the Dry site were similar in the treated and control plots at 16 yr.
   Conversely, at the Semi-arid site, the species richness and Sh.annon
   diversity index values were enhanced by the thinning treatments carried
   out 10 yr after the fire. Plant cover increased despite the treatments
   (scrubbing and thinning) on both the pine and understorey layers in
   every treated plot.
   Conclusion: Our forest management trials eshanced the diversity indices

Abstract = {{Fire is a natural process and the dominant disturbance shaping plant and
   animal communities in many coniferous forests of the western US. Given
   that fire size and severity are predicted to increase in the future, it
   has become increasingly important to understand how wildlife responds to
   fire and post-fire management. The Angora Fire burned 1243 hectares of
   mixed conifer forest in South Lake Tahoe, California. We conducted avian
   point counts for the first 3 years following the fire in burned and
   unburned areas to investigate which habitat characteristics are most
   important for re-establishing or maintaining the native avian community
   in post-fire landscapes. We used a multi-species occurrence model to
   estimate how avian species are influenced by the density of live and
   dead trees and shrub cover. While accounting for variations in the
   detectability of species, our approach estimated the occurrence
   probabilities of all species detected including those that were rare or
   observed infrequently. Although all species encountered in this study
   were detected in burned areas, species-specific modeling results
   predicted that some species were strongly associated with specific
   post-fire conditions, such as a high density of dead trees, open-canopy
   conditions or high levels of shrub cover that occur at particular burn
   severities or at a particular time following fire. These results
   indicate that prescribed fire or managed wildfire which burns at low to
   moderate severity without at least some high-severity effects is both
   unlikely to result in the species assemblages that are unique to
   post-fire areas or to provide habitat for burn specialists.
   Additionally, the probability of occurrence for many species was
   associated with high levels of standing dead trees indicating that
   intensive post-fire harvest of these structures could negatively impact
   habitat of a considerable proportion of the avian community.}},

   Altered fuel patterns across the landscape influences ecological
   processes including fire behavior, fire effects, and can impact

   was to determine how accumulations of ground fuels beneath western
   juniper (Juniperus occidentalis ssp. occidentalis) canopies, composed of
   litter and duff, affect post-fire species response in sagebrush steppe
   and to quantify fuel loading patterns. Field sampling and analysis was
   conducted across environmental gradients following the 2007
   Tongue-Crutcher Wildfire in southwestern Idaho to determine conditions
   that were most influential in post-fire vegetation recovery patterns.
   Duff depth and fire severity were determined to be the most influential
   factors affecting post-fire vegetation response. Decreasing species
   richness and native perennial grass cover was represented along the
   increasing duff depth gradient. Species response grouped by fire
   severity revealed significant presence of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)

Abstract = {{Aims: Structural and compositional changes along post-fire succession
   modify plant community proneness to burn (flammability). The dominant
   regeneration strategies and life forms, and their interactions along
   post-fire succession, modulate these changes by affecting density,
   amount and connectivity of fuels. Depending on how flammability evolves
   during post-fire succession it may feed back negatively, neutrally or
   positively into fire probability and behaviour. Negative fire-vegetation
   feedbacks arise when communities increase flammability as stands age,
   while positive feedbacks occur where early stages have higher
   flammability than later stages. We characterized changes in vegetation
   structure and fuel characteristics with time since fire in sites where
   either resprouters maintained dominance (shrublands), or where colonizer
   trees reached the sites and dominate later post-fire stages (forests).
   Location: Northwestern Patagonia, Argentina.
   Methods: We measured vegetation structure and characterized fine fuels
   with the intercept pole method in stands of different post-fire age in
   18 shrublands (range 1-115 years) and 18 forests (range 7-216 years).
   Results: In shrublands fuel amount quickly recovered after fire to a
   relatively constant value and fine fuel density remained high.
   Conversely, in forests, fuel amount rapidly increased during early
   post-fire stages (when resprouting shrubs dominate the community),
   peaked at c. 30-50 years (related to the co-existence of resprouters and
   young trees) and decreased to a relatively constant value (when tall
   trees dominate the community and suppress resprouters). Moreover, forest
   fuel density decreased with time. These changes in fuel characteristics
   were largely linked to changes in vegetation structure, which in turn
   were modulated by the dominant regeneration strategies and life forms.
   Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of a positive fire-vegetation
   feedback for the community dominated by colonizer trees, while the
   community dominated by resprouter shrubs showed a neutral feedback.
   Given the co-existence of flammable shrublands bordering fire-sensitive
   forests and their low tree regeneration rates, we argue that forest
   communities are especially sensitive to changes in fire frequency and
   severity driven by global change. Anthropogenic or climate-driven
   changes in ignitions are threatening these landscapes, which may undergo
   potentially rapid transformations, as seen in other temperate
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the drivers of ecosystem responses to disturbance is
   essential for management aimed at maintaining or restoring ecosystem
   processes and services, especially where invasive species respond
   strongly to disturbance. In this study, we used repeat vegetation
   surveys from a network of prescribed fire treatments at the
   woodland-shrubland interface in the Shoshone Mountains, Nevada, USA, to
   investigate post-fire responses of the understory plant community.
   First, we characterized post-fire community trajectories for sites
   located along an elevational gradient, hypothesizing a positive
   relationship between elevation and resistance to invasion. Unburned
   understory communities and their responses to disturbance differed along
   the gradient. As hypothesized, lower elevations experienced greater
   species turnover and higher invasive annual grass (Bromus tectorum)
   cover after fire. Second, we characterized post-fire plant community
   trajectories for sites with varying levels of pre-fire pinyon and
   juniper cover, hypothesizing that pre-fire tree dominance and associated
   reductions in perennial understory species lead to less predictable
   post-fire trajectories. Among sites with low-to-moderate tree cover,
   burning largely eliminated differences in understory composition,
   suggesting that biotic legacies were sufficient to result in predictable
   trajectories. In contrast, sites with high pre-fire tree cover
   transitioned into an annual forb-dominated community with sparse
   vegetation cover, suggesting that the loss of the understory community
   initiated unpredictable and divergent post-fire trajectories. Because
   plant communities were still changing four years after fire, it is
   unclear whether the alternate trajectories in sites with high tree cover
   will result in the formation of alternate states, or whether community
   composition will eventually converge with other sites at the same
   elevation. Results indicate that careful evaluation of site
   characteristics can be used to predict treatment outcomes at the
   woodland-shrubland interface, and to guide the appropriate use of
   prescribed fire or other management practices.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Few studies have examined post-fire vegetation recovery in
   temperate forest ecosystems with Landsat time series analysis. We
   analyzed time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from
   LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation fitting to examine post-fire
   NBR recovery for several wildfires that occurred in three different
   coniferous forest types in western North America during the years 2000
   to 2007. We summarized NBR recovery trends, and investigated the
   influence of burn severity, post-fire climate, and topography on
   post-fire vegetation recovery via random forest (RF) analysis.
   Results: NBR recovery across forest types averaged 30 to 44\% five years
   post fire, 47 to 72\% ten years post fire, and 54 to 77\% 13 years post
   fire, and varied by time since fire, severity, and forest type. Recovery
   rates were generally greatest for several years following fire. Recovery
   in terms of percent NBR was often greater for higher-severity patches.
   Recovery rates varied between forest types, with conifer-oak-chaparral
   showing the greatest NBR recovery rates, mixed conifer showing
   intermediate rates, and ponderosa pine showing slowest rates. Between 1
   and 28\% of patches had recovered to pre-fire NBR levels 9 to 16 years
   after fire, with greater percentages of low-severity patches showing
   full NBR recovery.
   Precipitation decreased and temperatures generally remained the same or
   increased post fire. Pre-fire NBR and burn severity were important
   predictors of NBR recovery for all forest types, and explained 2 to 6\%
   of the variation in post-fire NBR recovery. Post-fire climate anomalies
   were also important predictors of NBR recovery and explained an
   additional 30 to 41\% of the variation in post-fire NBR recovery.
   Conclusions: Landsat time series analysis was a useful means of
   describing and analyzing post-fire vegetation recovery across
   mixed-severity wildfire extents. We demonstrated that a relationship
   exists between post-fire vegetation recovery and climate in temperate
   ecosystems of western North America. Our methods could be applied to
   other burned landscapes for which spatially explicit measurements of
   post-fire vegetation recovery are needed.}},

Abstract = {{In fire-prone landscapes, differences in post-fire regeneration by
   resprouting between species or sites could be far more important in
   explaining vegetation physiognomy and composition than seed
   regeneration. This is the first study exploring the relative
   contribution of tree resprouts and seeds to post-fire crown volume in
   the Chaco Serrano forest of South America. Additionally, we compare the
   resprouting response among species and quantify post-fire changes in
   tree composition among sites. We established 290 permanent plots
   distributed in three sites affected by wildfires in 2005. For all tree
   species in all plots we recorded survival of every individual 1 year
   after the fire; at the plot level, we recorded the above-ground tree
   volume before and 3 years after the fire. Resprouting from the base was
   the main resprouting type. Survival varied between species from 73\% to
   100\% for native species and from 7\% to 100\% for non-natives. Before
   the fire, crown volume was similar in the three sites, and was
   completely lost after the fire in 92\% of the plots. Three years after
   the fire, between 8\% and 58\% of crown volume was recovered. The ratio
   of crown recovery because of resprouts and seedlings was 1562:1. Tree
   composition exhibited few changes because of the high post-fire survival
   of most native species. We conclude that in the semiarid Chaco Serrano
   ecosystem tree species regenerate mainly by resprouting. This
   regeneration mode should be taken into account to better understand
   post-fire successional pathways of these forests, their management and
   the restoration of burnt forest areas.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.)-dominated ecosystems
   in northern Lower Michigan is maintained by large, frequent,
   stand-replacing fires that often leave unburned forest strips (hereafter
   called ``stringers{''}) which may persist for decades on the post-fire
   landscape. Regional fire suppression practices have altered the fire
   regime, however, and structural variability has been further disrupted
   by extensive plantations designed to provide habitat for the
   federally-endangered Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii Baird).
   Jack pine plantations lack stringers and other structural heterogeneity
   found in fire-regenerated forests, and older live trees that comprise
   stringers are often harvested for timber. However, ecological effects of
   stringers on adjacent vegetation patterns and processes are poorly
   understood. We hypothesized that stringers act as post-fire refugia for
   plant species and provide a prolonged jack pine seed source for
   reseeding the burned landscape, and thus should be considered for
   inclusion in ecosystem-based management plans. We sampled data from four
   post-fire areas of different times-since-fire to investigate effects of
   stringers on post-fire plant community composition and stand structure.
   We evaluated plant community composition and compared stand density and
   age distributions at increasing distances from stringers to determine
   stringer effects on post-fire regeneration. In several burned areas,
   ground cover plant communities farthest from stringers differed from
   those both adjacent to and within stringers; areas burned relatively
   recently (12 and 32 years post-fire) showed the most pronounced
   differences. Structurally, several burned areas displayed broader
   sapling age distributions closer to stringers, suggesting that mature
   trees in stringers act as a prolonged seed source to the adjacent burned
   area. Thus, stringers not only influence immediate post-fire
   heterogeneity by retaining living trees on the burned landscape, but
   they also continue to provide inputs to the regenerating post-fire
   forest. Because the Kirtland's warbler population has recovered, and the
   warbler's delisting from endangered status is imminent, our results may
   be useful for guiding future ecosystem-based, adaptive forest management
   practices and, more broadly, retention patterns in stand replacing
   fire-prone areas.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire timber harvesting (salvage logging) is becoming more prevalent
   as logging companies try to recover some of the economic losses caused
   by fire. Because salvaging is a relatively new practice and because of
   the common perception that burned areas are of little value to wildlife,
   few guidelines exist for salvaging operations. We surveyed birds in
   unburned and burned stands of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.),
   mixedwood, and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) to
   characterize the post-fire bird community in commercially important
   forest types. The effects of salvage logging were examined in mixedwood
   and jack pine. Using fixed-radius point counts, a total of 1430
   individuals representing 51 species were detected during this study.
   Community analysis revealed that burned forests supported a distinct
   species assemblage of songbirds relative to unburned forests and that
   salvage logging significantly altered this community. An examination of
   guild composition showed that resident species. canopy and cavity
   nesters, and insectivores were the least likely to be detected in
   salvaged areas. Species less sensitive to salvage logging tended to be
   habitat generalists. omnivores, and specie, that nest on the ground or

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a primary natural disturbance in boreal forests, and
   post-fire vegetation recovery rate influences carbon, water, and energy
   exchange between the land and atmosphere in the region. Seed
   availability and environmental filtering are two important determinants
   in regulating post-fire vegetation recovery in boreal forests.
   Quantifying how these determinants change over time is helpful for
   understanding post-fire forest successional trajectory. Time series of
   remote sensing data offer considerable potential in monitoring the
   trajectory of post-fire vegetation recovery dynamics beyond current
   field surveys about structural attributes, which generally lack a
   temporal perspective across large burned areas. We used a time series of
   the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized
   difference shortwave infrared reflectance index (NDSWIR) derived from
   Landsat images to investigate post-fire dynamics in a Chinese boreal
   larch forest. An adjacent, unburned patch of a similar forest type and
   environmental conditions was selected as a control to separate
   interannual fluctuation in NDVI and NDSWIR caused by climate from
   changes due to wildfire. Temporal anomalies in NDVI and NDSWIR showed
   that more than 10 years were needed for ecosystems to recover to a
   pre-fire state. The boosted regression tree analysis showed that fire
   severity exerted a persistent, dominant influence on vegetation recovery
   during the early post-fire successional stage and explained more than
   60\% of variation in vegetation recovery, whereas distance to the
   nearest unburned area and environmental conditions exhibited a
   relatively small influence. This result indicated that the legacy
   effects of fire disturbance, which control seed availability for tree
   recruitment, would persist for decades. The influence of environmental
   filtering could increase with succession and could mitigate the initial
   heterogeneity in recovery caused by wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive wildfires affected Northern Achaia in the last decade. The
   largest proportion of the burnt areas is localized in Aleppo pine (Pinus
   halepensis Miller) forests. Post-fire vegetation succession of two
   adjacent Pinus halepensis forests in this area has been studied. The
   studied forests lie around Platani and Ziria villages and were burnt
   during great wildfires in 1989 and 1995, respectively. Floristic
   diversity and vegetation dynamics were studied in the burnt forests of
   Platani and Ziria, and also in unburnt stands, during a two year period
   (1995 - 1997). The data process showed great floristic similarity
   between the quadrats one and two years after the wildfire. The
   characteristic plants of these quadrats are annual herbs that belong
   mostly to the Leguininosae and Compositae families. Plant diversity is
   found at a minimum one year after fire, but it increases during the
   following years and drops again in the unburnt forest. The vegetation of
   the mature forest is characterized by the dominance of woody perennial
   species that create a dense understorey beneath the Pinus halepensis
   trees. All plant species of the unburnt forest are already present
   during the early post-fire years. The observed succession is nothing
   more than the replacement of small, short-lived plants by large,
   long-lived ones. This succession pattern matches the ``initial floristic
   composition{''} model of Egler.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire forest regeneration is strongly influenced by abiotic and

   fire regimes, species characteristics, landforms, hydrology, regional
   climate, and soil properties. Assessing these drivers is key to
   understanding the long-term effects of fire disturbances on forest
   succession. We evaluated multiple factors influencing patterns of
   variability in a post-fire boreal Larch (Larix sibirica) forest in
   Siberia. A time-series of remote sensing images was analyzed to estimate
   post-fire recovery as a response variable across the burned area in
   1996. Our results suggested that burn severity and water content were
   primary controllers of both Larch forest recruitment and green
   vegetation cover as defined by the forest recovery index (FRI) and the
   fractional vegetation cover (FVC), respectively. We found a high rate of
   Larch forest recruitment in sites of moderate burn severity, while a
   more severe burn was the preferable condition for quick occupation by
   vegetation that included early seral communities of shrubs, grasses,
   conifers and broadleaf trees. Sites close to water and that received
   higher solar energy during the summer months showed a higher rate of
   both recovery types, defined by the FRI and FVC, dependent on burn
   severity. In addition to these factors, topographic variables and

Abstract = {{From 1980-1989, fires burned 32 440 km(2) of boreal forest, 200 km south
   of the forest-tundra border in northern Quebec, Canada. An assessment of
   the impact of fire on tree population densities was carried out by
   comparing the number of Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana in 83 sites
   before and after the sites burned in 1981, 1983, 1988 or 1989. Age
   structure analysis of post-fire populations burned in 1972, 1976 and
   1983, along with the rapid exhaustion of the seed bank from burned
   trees, suggest that the majority of seedlings were established within 3
   to 10 yr after fire. Consequently, given the absence of nearby living
   seed bearers, little (if any) further recruitment can be expected in the
   even-aged, regenerating populations. According to the tree density
   comparison (pre-fire vs post-fire), a shift from Picea- to
   Pinus-dominated communities occurred in most of the sites burned in 1981
   or 1983, and in some of the sites burned in 1988 or 1989. The 1988 fire
   reduced the tree population density by 95 \% in 10 of the 15 sites;
   total tree density decreased by at least 75 \% in 28 out of 40 sites
   burned in 1989. This suggests that the areas burned in 1988 and 1989
   will mainly regenerate as very open forests or lichen-heath communities
   that are more commonly found in the forest-tundra zone, north of the
   study area. Fire intensity, short fire interval, and unfavorable climate
   during and after fires are three plausible mechanisms associated with
   these post-fire vegetation changes.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated, over nine years, the effects of thinning and burning on
   vegetation response in a ponderosa pine/pinegrass forest. Ponderosa pine
   forests in the eastern Cascade Mountains of Washington support dense,
   stands in which crown fires are probable, owing to post-settlement sheep
   grazing (increased tree seedling establishment), logging, and fire
   exclusion. In 1991, the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest began to
   apply long-term management techniques to mitigate post-settlement
   changes in ponderosa pine forests. We used a randomized complete block
   design with a linear regression component to analyze post-fire responses
   of the vegetation. Thinning and burning had little effect on the canopy
   layer of ponderosa pine, western larch, and Douglas-fir, but small grand
   fir trees, and nearly half of the saplings of all species, were killed.
   Shrubs in the middle forest layer were top-killed, but resprouted during
   the first post-fire growing season, and increased dramatically after 3
   yr and 9 yr. Frequency and cover maintained or increased for species in
   the lower forest layer in post-fire years 1, 3, and 9. The thinning and
   fire treatments reduced the middle layer of small trees and shrubs in
   the first post-fire year, but by the third and ninth post-fire years
   tree seedlings, especially grand fir and ponderosa pine, and small
   shrubs were abundant in the understory. Thinning trees and removing

Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{272-278}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - This is the first report on early vegetation
   dynamics in prescribed slash-pile burns under a sub-Mediterranean
   climate. We studied a managed forest system of Pinus sylvestris
   plantations in the upper belt of Quercus pyrenaica forests in the
   Guadarrama Mountains (Spanish Central System). We investigated post-fire
   plant succession in order to assess how fire affects tree regeneration
   and species composition (vascular plants, bryophytes and fungi) in the
   first three years.
   Methods - Species composition, species cover, number of pine seedlings
   and ecological data were recorded in twenty slash-pile burnt plots and
   twenty control plots the first and second year after fire. To identify
   ecological indicators and examine post-fire succession, we determined
   Indicator Analysis and Neighbour Joining Tree, respectively. Wilcoxon's
   signed-ranks test and Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation were
   used to study the effects of fire on pine seedlings survival and its
   changes overtime. Principal Components Analysis was performed to assess
   the relationships between environmental and structural variables in
   burnt plots.
   Key results - The early plant community established after slash-pile
   prescribed burns was characterized by three pioneer species: Funaria
   hygrometrica (moss), Coltricia perennis and Psathyrella pennata (fungi).
   No taxonomical changes were detected in vascular plant families but
   there was an increased presence of therophytes and pine seedlings. Two
   early vegetation stages were identified relating to species richness and
   Funaria hygrometrica cover. Fire significantly increased pine seedlings
   density, which subsequently decreased overtime. Survival of one-year old
   pine seedlings was unrelated to the year of the burn.
   Conclusions - We highlight the importance of bryophyte and fungi species
   in comparison to seeder species as indicators of recent prescribed
   slash-pile burns under a sub-Mediterranean climate; and also point out
   the impact of prescribed slash-pile burns on pine seedling recruitment
   after the first years post-fire. This recruitment decelerates over time
   in burnt sites, and it is more pronounced in control plots.}},

Abstract = {{In forest ecosystems where infrequent, severe fires have been an
   important process in shaping ecosystem structure, understanding the
   effects of introduced livestock on post-fire recovery of the vegetation
   is essential for effective forest resource management and preservation.
   In Nahuel Huapi National Park in northwestern Patagonia, we studied the
   effects of livestock on the post-fire recovery of a Nothofagus
   dombeyi-Austrocedrus chilensis forest that was burned in 1999. We
   experimentally excluded cattle by fencing plots and compared the
   vegetation characteristics of fenced and unfenced control plots over a
   5-year period. Although cattle did not significantly reduce total plant
   cover or total species richness, they did reduce maximum heights of
   woody species including the dominant tree species. Chusquea culeou, a
   tall understory bamboo, can impede establishment and height growth of
   the dominant tree species. Although C. culeou accounts for the largest
   percentage of cattle diet, its mean cover and mean maximum height were
   not strongly affected by cattle. The reduction in the height growth of
   seedlings of N. dombeyi and Austrocedrus in the unfenced areas implies
   that presence of cattle in the recently burned areas may contribute to a
   post-fire transition from tall forest to bamboo-dominated shrubland that
   is already widespread in this landscape. Thus, these results provide
   support for the fencing of recently burned Nothofagus and Austrocedrus
   forests in the national parks for periods long enough to allow the
   dominant tree species to grow to heights at which they are no longer
   severely inhibited by cattle browsing. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Straw mulching is one of the most common treatments applied
   immediately post fire to reduce soil erosion potential and mitigate
   post-fire effects on water quality, downstream property, and
   infrastructure, but little is known about the long-term effects on
   vegetation response. We sampled six fires that were mulched between 9
   and 13 years ago in western US dry conifer forests. We compared
   understory plant species diversity and abundance, tree seedling density
   and height by species, and fractional ground cover on mulched and
   unmulched paired plots.
   Results: Mulch did not influence understory plant diversity, species
   richness, or fractional ground cover. However, on mulched plots, tree
   seedlings grew taller faster, especially on north-facing aspects, and
   there was slightly more graminoid cover. Mulch did not affect overall
   tree seedling density, but there were fewer ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa Lawson \& C. Lawson) and more Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii {[}Mirb.] Franco) in mulched areas, especially on south-facing
   slopes.
   Conclusions: Managers will be able to weigh the long-term implications
   of mulching against the short-term reductions in soil erosion potential.
   While there are many concerns about vegetation suppression and exotic
   species introduction from using straw mulch, our study suggests that the
   long-term effects are subtle 9 to 13 years after post-fire mulching.}},

   for karst processes}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires reduce soil CO2 concentration by destroying vegetation and
   soil-dwelling microbes, thus reducing soil respiration. Post-fire
   vegetation recovery is primarily determined by vegetation growth forms
   and modes of regeneration, whereas long-term recovery of soil microbes
   is largely dependent on vegetation rehabilitation. With previous
   research focussing on post-fire respiration recovery in the context of
   CO2 flux between the soil and atmosphere, there is a lack of studies
   measuring the longterm response of soil CO2 concentration in karst
   environments. Hence, this study aimed to quantify whether soil CO2
   concentration was reduced 5 and 10 years after fires in a karst
   environment and to consider the implications for karst dissolution
   processes and speleothem growth rate. Paired sites with burnt and
   unburnt soil were compared with regards to soil CO2 concentration, soil
   temperature and soil moisture. Samples were taken from a grassland
   community and woodland community burnt 5 years prior and a forest
   community burnt 10 years prior. The results showed that soil respiration
   was depressed in the burnt site relative to the unburnt control in the
   woodland 5 years post-fire. A vegetation survey indicated that there
   substantially less biomass in the burnt site relative to the unburnt
   site. In the forest site 10 years post-fire there was no significant
   difference in soil CO2 concentration or vegetation between the burnt and
   control. This demonstrates that soil CO2 concentration takes >5 years to
   recover to pre-fire levels in woodlands and <10 years in subalpine
   forests and is determined by vegetation recovery. This long-term
   reduction in soil CO2 concentration caused by fire has the potential to
   affect karst subsurface processes governed by soil CO2 which lead to
   incorrect interpretation of speleothem proxy climate records.}},

Volume = {{346}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in environmental factors (e.g. soils) and disturbances
   (e.g. fire) are important drivers of plant diversity but the relative
   strength of their effects may be scale dependent. Given that fire
   regimes are often manipulated to maintain plant diversity at the
   landscape scale, detecting and disentangling fire from environmental
   effects at this scale is important. In SE Australia prescribed burning
   and wildfires have created mosaics of post-fire age-classes in
   vegetation ranging from moist forests to sclerophyllous heathlands along
   a gradient of decreasing productivity (rainfall and soil fertility).
   This provided us with an opportunity to investigate the effects of both
   environmental and disturbance heterogeneity on plant diversity at the
   landscape scale. Our survey units were mosaics (approx. 100 ha) of
   varying heterogeneity in the numbers of vegetation types (surrogate for
   environment) and post-fire age-classes (disturbance). As predicted, we
   found that plant diversity increased as the number of vegetation types
   in mosaics increased and as mean annual rainfall increased from
   heathlands to moist forests. There was also a weaker positive
   relationship between plant diversity and the number of post-fire
   age-classes in mosaics. The effect of post-fire age-classes on plant
   diversity was much stronger, however, when each vegetation type was
   considered separately, with species composition more sensitive to
   post-fire ages-classes in the moist forests at higher productivity
   compared with sclerophyllous heathlands at lower productivity. The
   effectiveness of mosaic burning in maintaining plant species diversity
   in environmentally diverse landscapes is therefore stronger at the small
   scale, within vegetation types, where the influence of environmental
   factors is minimised. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Question: How do pre-fire conditions (community composition and
   environmental characteristics) and climate-driven disturbance
   characteristics (fire severity) affect post-fire community composition
   in black spruce stands?
   Location: Northern boreal forest, interior Alaska.
   Methods: We compared plant community composition and environmental stand
   characteristics in 14 black spruce stands before and after multiple,
   naturally occurring wildfires. We used a combination of vegetation table
   sorting, univariate (ANOVA, paired t-tests), and multivariate (detrended
   correspondence analysis) statistics to determine the impact of fire
   severity and site moisture on community composition, dominant species
   and growth forms.
   Results: Severe wildfires caused a 50\% reduction in number of plant
   species in our study sites. The largest species loss, and therefore the
   greatest change in species composition, occurred in severely burned
   sites. This was due mostly to loss of non-vascular species (mosses and
   lichens) and evergreen shrubs. New species recruited most abundantly to
   severely burned sites, contributing to high species turnover on these
   sites. As well as the strong effect of fire severity, pre-fire and
   post-fire mineral soil pH had an effect on post-fire vegetation
   patterns, suggesting a legacy effect of site acidity. In contrast,
   pre-fire site moisture, which was a strong determinant of pre-fire
   community composition, showed no relationship with post-fire community
   composition. Site moisture was altered by fire, due to changes in
   permafrost, and therefore post-fire site moisture overrode pre-fire site
   moisture as a strong correlate.
   Conclusions: In the rapidly warming climate of interior Alaska, changes
   in fire severity had more effect on post-fire community composition than
   did environmental factors (moisture and pH) that govern landscape
   patterns of unburned vegetation. This suggests that climate change
   effects on future community composition of black spruce forests may be

Abstract = {{As the size and extent of wildfires has increased in recent decades, so
   has the cost and extent of post-fire management, including seeding and
   salvage logging. However, we know little about how burn severity,
   salvage logging, and post-fire seeding interact to influence vegetation
   recovery long-term. We sampled understory plant species richness,
   diversity, and canopy cover one to six years post fire (2006 to 2009,
   and 2011) on 72 permanent plots selected in a stratified random sample
   to define post-fire vegetation response to burn severity, post-fire
   seeding with native grasses, and salvage logging on the 2005 School Fire
   in eastern Washington. Understory vegetation responded rapidly post fire
   due, in part, to ample low intensity rainfall events in the first
   post-fire growing season. Vegetation was more diverse with greater plant
   species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) in low and
   moderate burn severity plots in 2006 (species richness 18; diversity
   2.3) compared to high burn severity plots (species richness 10;
   diversity 1.8), with species richness on the high severity plots
   reaching 19 in the sixth post-fire year, similar to the initial values
   on the low and moderate burn severity plots. Plants that commonly
   resprout from rhizomes, bulbs, and other surviving belowground sources
   were abundant post fire, while those establishing from off-site seed
   sources, including non-native species, were present but not abundant.
   Plots seeded with native grass post fire and not salvage logged had the
   highest canopy cover of graminoid species: more than 30 \% six years
   after the fire (in 2011), with low forb (15 \%) and shrub (1 \%) canopy
   cover and species richness. For comparison, high severity plots that
   were not seeded and not salvage logged had 3 \% graminoid cover, 14 \%
   forb cover, and 26 \% shrub cover. Plots that had been salvage logged
   from one to three years after the fire produced less canopy cover of
   shrubs and forbs, but three times more canopy cover of graminoids on the
   high burn severity plots by 2011. High severity plots that were salvage
   logged and not seeded with native grasses had the lowest species
   richness, diversity, and cover. Very few non-native species were found,
   regardless of salvage logging and seeding. Rapid post-fire growth
   dominated by native plants of high diversity suggests that this forest's
   vegetation and soils are highly resilient to disturbance. Overall, burn
   severity and post-fire seeding with native grasses were more influential
   than salvage logging on understory plant abundance one to six years
   after fire.}},

Abstract = {{Following stand-replacing wildfire, post-fire (salvage) logging of
   fire-killed trees is a widely implemented management practice in many
   forest types. A common hypothesis is that removal of fire-killed trees
   increases surface temperatures due to loss of shade and increased solar
   radiation, thereby influencing vegetation establishment and possibly
   stand development. Six years after a wildfire in a Mediterranean-climate
   mixed-conifer forest in southwest Oregon, USA, we measured the effects
   of post-fire logging (> 90 per cent dead tree (snag) removal) on growing
   season surface air temperatures. Compared with unlogged severely burned
   forest, post-fire logging did not lead to increased maximum daily
   surface air temperature. However, dead tree removal was associated with
   lower nightly minimum temperatures (similar to 1 degrees C) and earlier
   daytime heating, leading to a 1-2 degrees C difference during the
   warming portion of the day. Effects varied predictably by aspect. The
   patterns reported here represent a similar but muted pattern as
   previously reported for microclimatic changes following clear-cutting of
   green trees. Effects of microsites such as tree bases on fine-scale
   temperature regimes require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is one of the main disturbances affecting forest dynamics,
   succession, and the carbon cycle in Siberian forests. The Zabaikal
   region in southern Siberia is characterized by one of the highest levels
   of fire activity in Russia. Time series of Landsat data and field
   measurements of the reforestation state were analyzed in order to
   estimate post-fire vegetation recovery. The results showed that the
   normalized burn ratio time series can be used to estimate forest
   recovery in the pine- and larch-dominated forests of the Zabaikal
   region. Multiple factors determine a forest's recovery rate after a
   wildfire, including fire severity, tree species characteristics,
   topography, hydrology, soil properties, and climate. Assessing these
   factors is important if we are to understand the effects of fire on
   forest succession and to implement sustainable forest management
   strategies. In this work we used the field data and Landsat data to
   estimate post-fire vegetation dynamics as a function of several
   environmental factors. These factors include fire severity, pre-fire
   forest state, topography, and positive surface temperature anomalies. A
   regression model showed that fire frequency, fire severity, and surface
   temperature anomalies are the primary factors, explaining about 58\% of
   the variance in post-fire recovery. High frequency of fire and positive
   surface temperature anomalies hamper the post-fire reforestation
   process, while more severe burns are followed by higher recovery rates.
   Further studies are necessary to consider other important factors such
   as soil properties, moisture, and precipitation, for better explanation
   of post-fire vegetation recovery.}},

   and post-burn management activities. Both time-series vegetation data

Abstract = {{Many scientists and managers have an interest in describing the

   research has focused on the scientific rationale for classifying the
   post-fire environment. We developed an empirically-grounded soil
   post-fire index (PFI) based on available science and ecological
   thresholds. Using over 50 literature sources, we identified a minimum of
   five broad categories of post-fire outcomes: (a) unburned, (b) abundant
   surface organic matter (>85\% surface organic matter), (c) moderate
   amount of surface organic matter (>= 40 through 85\%), (d) small amounts
   of surface organic matter (<40\%), and (e) absence of surface organic
   matter (no organic matter left). We then subdivided each broad category
   on the basis of post-fire mineral soil colors providing a more
   fine-tuned post-fire soil index. We related each PFI category to
   characteristics such as soil temperature and duration of heating during
   fire, and physical, chemical, and biological responses. Classifying or
   describing post-fire soil conditions consistently will improve

Abstract = {{Land use changes and shifts in disturbance regimes (e.g. wildfires) are
   recognized worldwide as two of the major drivers of the current global
   change in terrestrial ecosystems. We expect that, in areas with
   large-scale land use changes, legacies from previous land uses persist
   and affect current ecosystem responses to climate-associated
   disturbances like fire. This study analyses whether post-fire vegetation
   dynamics may differ according to specific historical land use histories
   in a Mediterranean forest landscape of about 60,000 ha that was burnt by
   extensive fires. For that, we assessed land use history of the whole
   area through the second half of the XXth century, and evaluated the
   post-fire regeneration success in terms of: (i) forest cover and (ii)
   tree species composition (biotic-dispersed, resprouter species, Quercus
   spp. vs. wind-dispersed species with or without fire-resistant seed
   bank. Pinus spp.). Results showed that stable forest areas exhibited a
   higher post-fire recovery than younger forests. Furthermore. the longer
   since crop abandonment translates into a faster post-fire recovery.
   Results highlight that to anticipate the impacts of disturbances on
   ecosystems, historical land trajectories should be taken into account.

Abstract = {{Background Fuel treatments are widely used to alter fuels in forested
   ecosystems to mitigate wildfire behavior and effects. However, few
   studies have examined long-term ecological effects of interacting fuel
   treatments (commercial harvests, pre-commercial thinnings, pile and
   burning, and prescribed fire) and wildfire. Using annually fitted
   Landsat satellite-derived Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) curves and paired
   pre-fire treated and untreated field sites, we tested changes in the
   differenced NBR (dNBR) and years since treatment as predictors of
   biophysical attributes one and nine years after the 2007 Egley Fire
   Complex in Oregon, USA. We also assessed short- and long-term fuel
   treatment impacts on field-measured attributes one and nine years post
   fire. Results One-year post-fire burn severity (dNBR) was lower in
   treated than in untreated sites across the Egley Fire Complex. Annual
   NBR trends showed that treated sites nearly recovered to pre-fire values
   four years post fire, while untreated sites had a slower recovery rate.
   Time since treatment and dNBR significantly predicted tree canopy and
   understory green vegetation cover in 2008, suggesting that tree canopy
   and understory vegetation cover increased in areas that were treated
   recently pre fire. Live tree density was more affected by severity than
   by pre-fire treatment in either year, as was dead tree density one year
   post fire. In 2008, neither treatment nor severity affected percent
   cover of functional groups (shrub, graminoid, forb, invasive, and
   moss-lichen-fungi); however, by 2016, shrub, graminoid, forb, and
   invasive cover were higher in high-severity burn sites than in
   low-severity burn sites. Total fuel loads nine years post fire were
   higher in untreated, high-severity burn sites than any other sites. Tree
   canopy cover and density of trees, saplings, and seedlings were lower
   nine years post fire than one year post fire across treatments and
   severity, whereas live and dead tree basal area, understory surface
   cover, and fuel loads increased. Conclusions Pre-fire fuel treatments
   effectively lowered the occurrence of high-severity wildfire, likely due
   to successful pre-fire tree and sapling density and surface fuels
   reduction. This study also quantified the changes in vegetation and
   fuels from one to nine years post fire. We suggest that low-severity
   wildfire can meet prescribed fire management objectives of lowering
   surface fuel accumulations while not increasing overstory tree
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring post-fire vegetation response using remotely-sensed images is
   a top priority for post-fire management. This study investigated the
   potential of very-high-resolution (VHR) GeoEye images on detecting the
   field-measured burn severity of a forest fire that occurred in Evros
   (Greece) during summer 2011. To do so, we analysed the role of
   topographic conditions and burn severity, as measured in the field
   immediately after the fire (2011) and one year after (2012) using the
   Composite Burn Index (CBI) for explaining the post-fire vegetation
   response, which is measured using VHR satellite imagery. To determine
   this relationship, we applied redundancy analysis (RDA), which allowed
   us to identify which satellite variables among VHR spectral bands and
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can better express the
   post-fire vegetation response. Results demonstrated that in the first
   year after the fire event, variations in the post-fire vegetation
   dynamics can be properly detected using the GeoEye VHR data.
   Furthermore, results showed that remotely-sensed NDVI-based variables
   are able to encapsulate burn severity variability over time. Our
   analysis showed that, in this specific case, burn severity variations
   are mildly affected by the topography, while the NDVI index, as inferred
   from VHR data, can be successfully used to monitor the short-term
   post-fire dynamics of the vegetation recovery.}},

Abstract = {{An intense debate exists on the effects of post-fire salvage logging on
   plant community regeneration, but scant data are available derived from
   experimental studies. We analyzed the effects of salvage logging on
   plant community regeneration in terms of species richness, diversity,
   cover, and composition by experimentally managing a burnt forest on a
   Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, S Spain). In each of three plots
   located at different elevations, three replicates of three treatments
   were implemented seven months after the fire, differing in the degree of
   intervention: ``Non-Intervention{''} (all trees left standing),
   ``Partial Cut plus Lopping{''} (felling 90\% of the trees, cutting the
   main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ), and ``Salvage
   Logging{''} (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody
   debris). Plant composition in each treatment was monitored two years
   after the fire in linear point transects. Post-fire salvage logging was
   associated with reduced species richness, Shannon diversity, and total
   plant cover. Moreover, salvaged sites hosted different species
   assemblages and 25\% lower cover of seeder species (but equal cover of
   resprouters) compared to the other treatments. Cover of trees and shrubs
   was also lowest in Salvage Logging, which could suggest a potential
   slow-down of forest regeneration. Most of these results were consistent
   among the three plots despite plots hosting different plant communities.
   Concluding, our study suggests that salvage logging may reduce species
   richness and diversity, as well as the recruitment of woody species,
   which could delay the natural regeneration of the ecosystem. (C) 2013

   stand-structure and forest-floor small rodents, post-fire practices in
   burned stands should be reevaluated. Longterm experiments are needed to

Abstract = {{The primary goal of restoration is to create self-sustaining ecological
   communities that are resilient to periodic disturbance. Currently,
   little is known about how restored communities respond to disturbance
   events such as fire and how this response compares to remnant
   vegetation. Following the 2003 fires in south-eastern Australia we
   examined the post-fire response of revegetation plantings and compared
   this to remnant vegetation. Ten burnt and 10 unburnt (control) sites
   were assessed for each of three types of vegetation (direct seeding
   revegetation, revegetation using nursery seedlings (tubestock) and
   remnant woodland). Sixty sampling sites were surveyed 6months after fire
   to quantify the initial survival of mid- and overstorey plant species in
   each type of vegetation. Three and 5years after fire all sites were
   resurveyed to assess vegetation structure, species diversity and vigour,
   as well as indicators of soil function. Overall, revegetation showed
   high (>60\%) post-fire survival, but this varied among species depending
   on regeneration strategy (obligate seeder or resprouter). The native
   ground cover, mid- and overstorey in both types of plantings showed
   rapid recovery of vegetation structure and cover within 3years of fire.
   This recovery was similar to the burnt remnant woodlands. Non-native
   (exotic) ground cover initially increased after fire, but was no
   different in burnt and unburnt sites 5years after fire. Fire had no
   effect on species richness, but burnt direct seeding sites had reduced
   species diversity (Simpson's Diversity Index) while diversity was higher
   in burnt remnant woodlands. Indices of soil function in all types of
   vegetation had recovered to levels found in unburnt sites 5years after
   fire. These results indicate that even young revegetation (stands
   <10years old) showed substantial recovery from disturbance by fire. This
   suggests that revegetation can provide an important basis for restoring
   woodland communities in the fire-prone Australian environment.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are the most dominant natural disturbance process
   influencing the habitat and distribution of woodland caribou (Rangifer
   tarandus caribou) in winter. This is a function of terrestrial lichens,
   the primary winter forage of caribou, taking decades to recover
   following fire. Working across the range of the Klaza caribou herd in
   the west -central Yukon, Canada, we used statistical count models to
   evaluate variation in lichen volume and percent cover among burns of
   different age classes. Burns of the same age had considerable variation
   in lichen abundance. Forage lichens were more abundant in coniferous
   stands with greater canopy openness, tree height, and basal area.
   Although not a significant parameter in models of volume or percent
   cover of lichen, time since burn improved model performance. Relative to
   thresholds in the published literature, most stands had sufficient
   lichen at 50 years post fire to be considered winter range for caribou.
   The relationship between caribou and burned landscapes is complex
   suggesting that wildlife and forest managers should look beyond burn age
   when accounting for the effects of fire on the availability and quality
   of winter habitat for woodland caribou.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean countries have a long-standing afforestation tradition, at
   least since the 19th century, and especially the mid-20th century. Large
   forest fires started to occur in the late 1970s, and the routine
   post-fire restoration approach involved planting pines and building
   check dams according to the prevailing forest management practices at
   the time. Increasing short-interval recurrent wildfires have threatened
   the persistence of pine plantations. In the last two decades, post-fire
   restoration practices have increasingly diversified in both number of
   plant species used in plantations and type of restoration actions taken.
   In an attempt to provide a comprehensive post-fire restoration strategy,
   we are developing and testing a new protocol that includes scientific
   knowledge provided by fire and restoration ecology of recent decades.
   For regional planning, fire-vulnerable forests and shrublands are
   identified according to vegetation resilience and post-fire erosion risk
   using a GIS-based approach. Vegetation resilience is assessed on the
   basis of the fire regeneration strategies of dominant plant species. On
   a management scale, the need for short-term emergency actions is
   assessed according to field surveys of fire severity, vegetation
   resilience, and soil erosion risk. Vulnerable areas meriting emergency
   actions are those predicted to have a low plant cover regeneration rate
   and a high erosion risk. Mid-and long-term actions are planned according
   to the specific management objectives for burned areas, and to the
   prediction of long-term ecosystem recovery. These actions may include
   assisted natural regeneration, (re) introduction of tree or shrubby
   species, and fire-prevention measures.}},

Title = {{Tree regeneration following wildfires in the western US: a review}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Wildfires, like many disturbances, can be catalysts for
   ecosystem change. Given projected climate change, tree regeneration
   declines and ecosystem shifts following severe wildfires are predicted.
   We reviewed scientific literature on post-fire tree regeneration to
   understand where and why no or few trees established. We wished to
   distinguish sites that won't regenerate to trees because of changing
   climate from sites where trees could grow post fire if they had a seed
   source or were planted, thus supporting forest ecosystem services for
   society and nature, such as timber supply, habitat, watershed
   protection, and carbon storage.
   Results: Our literature review showed that little to no post-fire tree
   regeneration was more common in low-elevation, dry forest types than in
   high-elevation forest types. However, depending on the region and
   species, low tree regeneration was also observed in high elevation,
   moist forests. Regeneration densities varied by species and seedling
   densities were attributed to distances to a seed source, water stress or
   precipitation, elevation, slope, aspect, and plant competition. Our
   findings provide land managers with two primary considerations to offset
   low tree regeneration densities. First, we supply a decision support
   tool of where to plant tree seedling in large high severity burned
   patches. Second, we recommend possibilities for mitigating and limiting
   large high severity burned patches to increase survival of trees to be
   sources of seed for natural regeneration.
   Conclusions: Few or no tree seedlings are establishing on some areas of
   the 150+ forest fires sampled across western US, suggesting that forests
   may be replaced by shrublands and grasslands, especially where few seed
   source trees survived the wildfires. Key information gaps on how species
   will respond to continued climate change, repeated disturbances, and
   other site factors following wildfires currently limit our ability to
   determine future trends in forest regeneration. We provide a decision
   tree to assist managers in prioritizing post-fire reforestation. We
   emphasize prioritizing the interior of large burned patches and
   considering current and future climate in deciding what, when, and where
   to plant trees. Finally, managing fires and forests for more seed-source
   tree survival will reduce large, non-forested areas following wildfires
   where post-fire management may be necessary.}},

Title = {{Effects of Post-Fire Deadwood Management on Soil Macroarthropod
   Communities}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dead wood comprises a vast amount of biological legacies that set the
   scene for ecological regeneration after wildfires, yet its removal is
   the most frequent management strategy worldwide. Soil-dwelling organisms
   are conspicuous, and they provide essential ecosystem functions, but
   their possible affection by different post-fire management strategies
   has so far been neglected. We analyzed the abundance, richness, and
   composition of belowground macroarthropod communities under two
   contrasting dead-wood management regimes after a large wildfire in the
   Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (Southeast Spain). Two plots at
   different elevation were established, each containing three replicates
   of two experimental treatments: partial cut, where trees were cut and
   their branches lopped off and left over the ground, and salvage logging,
   where all the trees were cut, logs were piled, branches were
   mechanically masticated, and slash was spread on the ground. Ten years
   after the application of the treatments, soil cores were extracted from
   two types of microhabitat created by these treatments: bare-soil (in
   both treatments) and under-logs (in the partial cut treatment only).
   Soil macroarthropod assemblages were dominated by Hemiptera and
   Hymenoptera (mostly ants) and were more abundant and richer in the
   lowest plot. The differences between dead-wood treatments were most
   evident at the scale of management interventions: abundance and richness
   were lowest after salvage logging, even under similar microhabitats
   (bare-soil). However, there were no significant differences between
   microhabitat types on abundance and richness within the partial cut
   treatment. Higher abundance and richness in the partial cut treatment
   likely resulted from higher resource availability and higher plant
   diversity after natural regeneration. Our results suggest that
   belowground macroarthropod communities are sensitive to the manipulation
   of dead-wood legacies and that management through salvage logging could
   reduce soil macroarthropod recuperation compared to other treatments
   with less intense management even a decade after application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the long-term effects on vegetation following the
   catastrophic fire in 1987 on the northern Great Xing'an Mountain by
   analyzing the AVHRR GIMMS 15-day composite normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) dataset. Both temporal and spatial
   characteristics were analyzed for natural regeneration and tree planting
   scenarios from 1984 to 2006. Regressing post-fire NDVI values on the
   pre-fire values helped identify the NDVI for burnt pixels in vegetation
   stands. Stand differences in fire damage were classified into five
   levels: Very High (VH), High (H), Moderate (M), Low (L) and Slight (S).
   Furthermore, intra-annual and inter-annual post-fire vegetation recovery
   trajectories were analyzed by deriving a time series of NDVI and
   relative regrowth index (RRI) values for the entire burned area.
   Finally, spatial pattern and trend analyses were conducted using the
   pixel-based post-fire annual stands regrowth index (SRI) with a
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) statistics method. The results show that
   October was a better period compared to other months for distinguishing
   the post-and pre-fire vegetation conditions using the NDVI signals in
   boreal forests of China because colored leaves on grasses and shrubs
   fall down, while the leaves on healthy trees remain green in October.
   The MK statistics method is robustly capable of detecting vegetation
   trends in a relatively long time series. Because tree planting primarily
   occurred in the severely burned area (approximately equal to the Medium,
   High and Very High fire damage areas) following the Daxing'anling fire
   in 1987, the severely burned area exhibited a better recovery trend than
   the lightly burned regions. Reasonable tree planting can substantially
   quicken the recovery and shorten the restoration time of the target
   species. More detailed satellite analyses and field data will be
   required in the future for a more convincing validation of the results.}},

Abstract = {{A wildfire which overran a sensor network site provided an opportunity
   (a natural experiment) to monitor short-term post-fire impacts
   (immediate and up to three months post-fire) in remnant eucalypt
   woodland and managed pasture plots. The magnitude of fire-induced
   changes in soil properties and soil microbial communities was determined
   by comparing (1) variation in fire-adapted eucalypt woodland vs. pasture
   grassland at the burnt site; (2) variation at the burnt woodland-pasture
   sites with variation at two unburnt woodland-pasture sites in the same
   locality; and (3) temporal variation pre- and post-fire. In the eucalypt
   woodland, soil ammonium, pH and ROC content increased post-fire, while
   in the pasture soil, soil nitrate increased post-fire and became the
   dominant soluble N pool. However, apart from distinct changes in N
   pools, the magnitude of change in most soil properties was small when
   compared to the unburnt sites. At the burnt site, bacterial and fungal
   community structure showed significant temporal shifts between pre- and
   post-fire periods which were associated with changes in soil nutrients,
   especially N pools. In contrast, microbial communities at the unburnt
   sites showed little temporal change over the same period. Bacterial
   community composition at the burnt site also changed dramatically post
   fire in terms of abundance and diversity, with positive impacts on
   abundance of phyla such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and
   Firmicutes. Large and rapid changes in soil bacterial community
   composition occurred in the fire-adapted woodland plot compared to the
   pasture soil, which may be a reflection of differences in vegetation
   composition and fuel loading. Given the rapid yet differential response
   in contrasting land uses, identification of key soil bacterial groups
   may be useful in assessing recovery of fire-adapted ecosystems,
   especially as wildfire frequency is predicted to increase with global
   climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important disturbance agent in the southern California
   landscape and plays a large role in the function and structure of its
   pine and mixed conifer forests. However, humans have changed the forest
   fire regime across the western United States by excluding fire. Fire
   suppression has been blamed for increasing stand densities and a shift
   from fire-tolerant trees to shade-tolerant but fire sensitive trees.
   These changes had been observed in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park (CRSP),
   Peninsular Ranges, San Diego County, California, USA. We surveyed an
   area in CRSP during the first two post-fire growing seasons following
   the October 2003 Cedar Fire, a historically large and severe fire, to
   determine patterns of tree mortality and vegetation recovery. This area
   is a mosaic of mixed evergreen and mixed conifer forest, oak woodland,
   chaparral and grassland. Most conifers were killed by the fire,
   especially smaller trees, and very few pine seedlings have established.
   Oaks were top-killed but most were resprouting by the second year,
   although larger oaks were more likely to have died than smaller. A rich
   herbaceous community of native annuals established in the first
   post-fire growing season. With a record rainy season during the winter
   of 2004-2005, all plant functional groups increased in abundance in the
   second year, including exotic annual grasses. The spread of exotic
   grasses in CRSP is a plant community change that may be of concern to
   resource managers. As forest succession is a long term process, it is
   important to continue monitoring vegetation recovery. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fire disturbance severely modifies ecosystem structure and functioning,
   and therefore predicting post-fire responses is pivotal to improve land
   management. Indicators that efficiently link post-fire recovery with a
   timely decision on landscape management can play a key role in the
   governance of fire risk. We describe a framework to evaluate post-fire
   recovery based on remotely-sensed measures of relative vegetation
   recovery, calculated from satellite NDVI time-series. Three indicators
   are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI),
   measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the
   Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term
   post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a
   measure of the short-term recovery rate. We used Random Forest (RF)
   models to predict the observed recovery patterns and ranked the
   predictive importance of several candidate explanatory factors. The
   performance of RF models ranged from good (CRRI, RTI) to moderate (HRT).
   Three sets of predictive variables consistently ranked higher: fire
   traits, landscape composition, and post-fire climatic conditions. The
   relative contribution of individual variables was different across
   recovery indicators. These results show that proposed indicators seem to
   capture different facets of the post-fire recovery process. The
   short-term recovery indicator (HRT) was linked to landscape composition
   and post-fire climate. Thus, HRT expresses the speed of initial
   recovery, related to differences in fire-response traits of vegetation
   and to climatic conditions immediately following fire. The mid-term
   recovery indicator (RTI) was mainly influenced by fire traits and
   post-fire climatic conditions. This indicator captures multiple
   interacting effects that shape the recovery process related to fire
   severity, vegetation type and post-fire conditions. Finally, the
   long-term recovery indicator (CRRI) was clearly more influenced by fire
   attributes related to severity than by vegetation type and structure or
   by post-fire climatic conditions. Overall, our results suggest that a
   combination of biotic processes (driven by plant life-history traits)
   and abiotic filters (e.g., post fire climate) determine the early
   post-fire recovery process. Conversely, the mid to long-term recovery
   response (expressing its completeness) is driven by the depletion of
   resilience capacity and by the amount of change in vegetation structure
   and functioning modulated by spatial differences in fire severity. Our
   results strongly suggest that an indicator-based approach grounded on
   satellite time-series of vegetation indices can effectively cover
   various facets of post-fire recovery. This will improve the monitoring
   and prediction of post-fire recovery dynamics, with valuable
   applications in fire hazard management and post-fire ecosystem
   restoration and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing with time series data offers considerable potential in
   the trajectory of post forest fire dynamics beyond the current
   monitoring of structural attributes that are displayed in the post-fire
   area. Many studies have addressed this topic by using time series remote
   sensing indices; however, this approach has sometimes been demonstrated
   as an unrealistic and biased representation of the post-fire forest
   patterns due to the saturation issues of vegetation indices. These
   saturation issues then lead to an underestimation of the forest
   successional stages and an overestimation of the forest recovery rate.
   This paper aims to develop a framework for trajectory of the post-fire
   forest patterns in the Siberian boreal larch forest (Larix sibirica)
   with the synergistic use of different remote sensing based
   vegetation-cover indicators derived from the Landsat time series and the
   WorldView-2 images. A time-series of the forest recovery index (FRI) and
   fractional vegetation cover (FVC) has been analyzed to estimate the
   rates of forest regeneration and vegetation recovery across different
   burn severity levels in the Siberian larch forest. The results showed
   that the FRI method can be used to observe the regrowth of the larch
   forest from the tenth year after the fire overlapping with the period of
   significant increase in the sapling stem volume. The post-fire larch
   forest canopy can fully recover to the pre-fire condition with respect
   to the magnitude of the FRI values after 30-47 years where the highest
   regeneration rate was observed in the moderate burn severity areas
   followed by the low and high burn severity. On the other hand, the FVC
   method was positively correlated with burn severity and more sensitive
   for evaluating the early stages of the forest succession in which the
   FVC dramatically increases after 5-6 years after the fire. The
   significant growth of FVC was accentuated by the maximum emergence of
   the sapling density as well as the rapid growth of herbaceous plants,
   grasses, shrubs, and shade-intolerant trees immediately after the fire,
   which could not be evaluated using the FRI. Both time series of the FRI
   and the FVC are valuable tools for determining the dominant stages of
   the post-fire larch forest succession in order to understand the
   relationships between fire disturbance and natural cycles of the boreal
   larch forest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   unanswered question, and a key issue for post-fire restoration planning.
   We characterized field-measured fire effects in forests 5-7 years after
   fire in severity categories as they were mapped with one year post-fire
   satellite data. The severity maps we used were produced from a
   relativized differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) derived from
   Landsat images and calibrated to three severity metrics: composite burn
   index (CBI), percent change in basal area (BA), and percent change in
   tree canopy cover (CC). Relationships of field-measured values with
   severity generally followed expected patterns. BA of dead trees and
   shrub cover increased with increasing fire severity. BA of live trees,
   total tree CC, conifer CC, litter cover, litter depth and duff depth all
   decreased with increasing severity. When forest type (yellow pine, dry
   mixed conifer, moist mixed conifer, fir) was added as an interaction
   term there were differences in the relationships of field-measured
   values to severity, some of which can be attributed to differences
   between pine and fir dominated forests. We did not find any difference
   in live BA between unburned, unchanged, low and moderate severity plots
   for yellow pine forests; the only significant decrease in live BA was in
   high severity plots. In contrast, both dry and moist mixed conifer
   forests showed more or less steadily decreasing live BA with increasing
   fire severity. For yellow pine dead BA there were no significant
   differences between unchanged, low and moderate categories, while there
   was a difference between unchanged and moderate for all other forest
   types. In the high-severity categories >91\% of plots had <10\% conifer
   CC, and >82\% of plots had <10\% total tree CC. Comparing our 5-7 year
   post-fire dataset to a separate dataset measured one year post-fire
   demonstrates that delayed tree mortality occurs at all levels of
   severity, and notable snag fall (especially pines) is already underway a
   half-decade after fire. The effects we measured provide useful
   information for managers interested in planning for post-fire activities
   up to 5-7 years after fire, including soil erosion abatement, habitat
   restoration, fuel and snag management, and tree regeneration management.

Abstract = {{Thresholds for burning vegetation communities in New South Wales (NSW)
   are based on plant species' responses to fire and do not consider other
   issues such as site attributes or fauna requirements. We investigated
   knowledge gaps concerning the impact of fire on habitat features of open
   forests and woodlands, and consider the adequacy of fire management
   based on the fire responses of flora. The consequences of managing fire
   at broader scales are complex and this study tests ideas concerning
   landscape attributes in relation to fire planning and biodiversity
   conservation. Habitat attributes of long unburnt vegetation were
   determined at sites with varying time since fire and fuel loads in these
   communities were measured. Time since fire was the most important
   variable for explaining the abundance of critical faunal habitat
   attributes. Tree and log hollows and fallen timber volume were markedly
   more abundant in long-unburnt vegetation, while fuel loads in open
   forests and woodlands unburnt for 100 or more years were low to moderate
   and similar to the hazard in recently burnt sites. Fire-interval
   thresholds based only on plant responses to fire compromises the
   achievement of optimal fauna habitat. Recommended upper thresholds are
   too low to cater for the habitat requirements of fauna. Consequently,
   long-unburnt vegetation should be identified as a threatened asset in
   fire planning and management and should be protected and actively
   promoted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Networks of narrow linear (similar to 3-12m wide) forest disturbances
   used for petroleum exploration (seismic lines) are common throughout
   Alberta's boreal forest. These `seismic' lines have often failed to
   recover trees decades after their initial disturbance, especially within
   treed peatland and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forests. This has led to
   regional increases in forest fragmentation contributing to declines in
   threatened woodland caribou. Restoration of seismic lines to forests is
   now a top priority for conservation and recovery of woodland caribou,
   but are expensive and often ignore the occurrence of wildfires that may
   destroy restoration investments (planted trees), yet also recruit trees.
   This is especially relevant to jack pine forests that burn more
   frequently than other forests and depend on moderate to high intensity
   fires to release seeds en masse from their serotinous cones. Although
   much is known about jack pine tree recruitment following fire, little is
   known about patterns of tree recovery on seismic lines and how this
   varies with fire severity, line width (forest gap size), and line
   orientation. Here we examine natural tree recovery across a gradient in
   fire severity (defined as percent overstory tree mortality) with
   different seismic line characteristics (forest gap width and
   orientation), as compared to adjacent forest stands, in jack pine
   forests 5-years post-fire in northeast Alberta, Canada. Overall, jack
   pine regeneration was consistently 2-fold higher on seismic lines
   compared to adjacent burned forests with stem density increasing with
   fire severity in both sites, especially when fire severity was greater
   than 40\%. We suggest that the observed increases in tree regeneration
   on seismic lines may be due to (1) removal of biomass and exposure of
   mineral soils on seismic lines creating more favorable conditions for
   jack pine seeds and seedlings; and/or (2) increases in available light
   resulting in better growing conditions and survival for this
   shade-intolerant species. Finally, we suggest that natural recovery
   (passive restoration) of seismic lines should be expected post-fire in
   jack pine stands and thus active restoration of these sites through
   silviculture and tree planting may not be the wisest use of limited
   restoration dollars if fires are locally common.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the role of post-fire residual organic matter (ROM)
   thickness as a driver of community assembly in eastern Newfoundland. We
   hypothesized that if post-fire community assembly is predominantly
   controlled by ROM thickness (an abiotic habitat filter), then post-fire
   species composition and functional traits should correspond to the depth
   and distribution of ROM. However, if species interactions (biotic
   filter) are the primary constraints on community assembly, then
   post-fire species composition and their functional traits should be
   independent of the depth and distribution of ROM. We tested these
   predictions in three relatively mature plant communities, Kalmia
   angustifolia heath, black spruce (Picea mariana)-Kalmia shrub savannah
   and black spruce forest. Through pre-fire stand reconstruction, we found
   evidence that the three communities originated from black spruce forest.
   ROM thickness in heath was almost twice that of shrub savannah and six
   times more than forest, suggesting a gradient in fire severity.
   Distribution of ROM corresponded to patterns in vegetation dominance,
   where thick ROM (> 2 cm) filtered out black spruce in favour of Kalmia.
   ROM thickness was a strong predictor of vegetation composition and
   function between heath and forest, but this was not found between the
   shrub savannah and forest. We attribute this to species interactions and
   allelopathy, which may have become important when ROM thickness was
   suitable for both seed (black spruce) and vegetative (Kalmia)
   regenerating species. Thus, priority effects or ``who came first{''} may
   have lead to shrub savannah formation when ROM thickness was similar to
   2 cm. We conclude that abiotic habitat filtering of thick ROM (> 2 cm)
   on (primarily) species' regeneration traits was the primary driver of
   community divergence from forest to heath and shrub savannah.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important factor in determining plant community composition

   change following a large fire at Point Reyes National Seashore,
   California, USA. Vegetation in the Point Reyes region is characterized
   by a complex mosaic of grassland, shrub, and forest plant communities,
   and by high levels of plant diversity. Although large fires are
   relatively rare on the coast of California north of San Francisco Bay,
   they are important in determining the distributions of plant communities
   at the landscape scale. We mapped vegetation communities throughout the
   study area using aerial imagery and analyzed how vegetation shifted
   following fire. We found substantial areas had transitioned from coastal
   scrub to ceanothus scrub (Ceanothus thyrsiflorus Eschsch.) or Bishop
   pine (Pinus muricata D. Don) forest following fire. Transitions from
   shrub to tree vegetation following fire have rarely been documented in
   this region. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the
   factors influencing the post-fire distribution of Bishop pine and
   ceanothus scrub. Proximity to pre-fire Bishop pine stands and pre-fire
   vegetation type were the most important predictors of post-fire Bishop
   pine regeneration. Pre-fire vegetation type, burn severity, and
   topography were the most important predictors of post-fire ceanothus

Abstract = {{Landsat Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is commonly used

   distinguish conifer tree presence and density. We then examined the
   post-fire pattern (1984-2017) in Landsat NDVI for fires that occurred a
   minimum of 20 years ago (1986-1997). Points were classified into four
   categories depending on whether NDVI, 20 years post-fire, had returned
   to pre-fire values in only the growing season, only under snow cover, in
   both seasons or neither. We found that each category of points showed
   distinct patterns of NDVI change that could be used to characterise the
   average pre-fire and post-fire vegetation condition Of the points
   analysed, 43\% showed a between-season disagreement if NDVI had returned
   to pre-fire values, suggesting that using dual-season NDVI can modify
   our interpretations of post-fire conditions. We also found an improved
   correlation between 5- and 20-year NDVI change under snow cover,

Abstract = {{The frequency and severity of forest fires, coupled with changes in
   spatial and temporal precipitation and temperature patterns, are likely
   to severely affect the characteristics of forest and permafrost patterns
   in boreal eco-regions. Forest fires, however, are also an ecological
   factor in how forest ecosystems form and function, as they affect the
   rate and characteristics of tree recruitment. A better understanding of
   fire regimes and forest recovery patterns in different environmental and
   climatic conditions will improve the management of sustainable forests
   by facilitating the process of forest resilience. Remote sensing has
   been identified as an effective tool for preventing and monitoring
   forest fires, as well as being a potential tool for understanding how
   forest ecosystems respond to them. However, a number of challenges
   remain before remote sensing practitioners will be able to better
   understand the effects of forest fires and how vegetation responds
   afterward. This article attempts to provide a comprehensive review of
   current research with respect to remotely sensed data and methods used
   to model post-fire effects and forest recovery patterns in boreal forest
   regions. The review reveals that remote sensing-based monitoring of
   post-fire effects and forest recovery patterns in boreal forest regions
   is not only limited by the gaps in both field data and remotely sensed
   data, but also the complexity of far-northern fire regimes, climatic
   conditions and environmental conditions. We expect that the integration
   of different remotely sensed data coupled with field campaigns can
   provide an important data source to support the monitoring of post-fire
   effects and forest recovery patterns. Additionally, the variation and
   stratification of pre- and post-fire vegetation and environmental
   conditions should be considered to achieve a reasonable, operational
   model for monitoring post-fire effects and forest patterns in boreal

Abstract = {{Aim: Managing fire is critical for the conservation of biodiversity in
   many ecosystems globally. To manage fire effectively, it is necessary to
   identify the temporal and spatial scales at which it affects a diverse
   range of species. This information is challenging to obtain for rare and
   threatened species for which data often are sparse, and in systems with
   long fire-return intervals (e.g. >100 years). We tested the effects of a
   century of fires on the distribution of 12 threatened bird species
   across a 100,000 km(2) region in which ``long-unburnt{''} vegetation has
   been identified as important for the diversity of common species.
   Location: Semi-arid mallee woodlands of south-eastern Australia.
   Methods: We developed spatially explicit models to identify the effects
   of fire history and climatic factors on the distribution of 12
   threatened bird species, including two globally endangered species, the
   Mallee Emu-wren (Stipiturus mallee) and Black-eared Miner (Manorina
   melanotis).
   Results: Fire was a driver of distribution for all species. Four species
   were common in younger vegetation (<20 years post-fire) and 11 were most
   common in mid (2060 years post-fire) to older (>60 years post-fire)
   vegetation. Species' distributions were further restricted to areas
   associated with particular vegetation types and climatic conditions.
   Main conclusions: Comprehensive investigation of the response to fire by
   a range of threatened species highlights the importance of what is now
   recognized as mid-successional mallee vegetation (20-60 years
   post-fire), and that species' preferences for previously identified
   ``long-unburnt{''} vegetation extend to >= 60 years post-fire. Fire
   management conducted with incomplete knowledge, or which is focussed on
   introducing prescribed burns or suppressing fires for
   early/late-successional species alone, is unlikely to maximize
   biodiversity. Effective fire management for biodiversity requires the
   promotion of ecological processes that result in key successional stages
   at particular locations in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Wildland fire is a major disturbance promoting landscape changes and
   triggering desertification processes in the Northern Mediterranean
   basin. Addressing that issue in the long term requires both fire
   prevention and pot-fire restoration measures. Post-fire restoration
   should mitigate ecosystem degradation, and improve ecosystem
   regeneration rate and quality.
   The impact of wildfires is especially acute in the transition between
   semi-arid and dry subhumid climates, where dry vegetation fuels
   facilitate fire spread and water shortage limits post-fire regeneration.
   In addition, the occurrence of torrential rains produces a high risk of
   post-fire flash-floods, especially in autumn after summer fires.
   The major objectives of post-fire restoration are soil and water
   conservation and increasing ecosystem resistance and resilience in front
   of fire. Post-fire restoration strategies are defined according to the
   degradation stage of the ecosystems and the recovery capacity of
   vegetation. Plant cover regeneration rate highly influence post-fire
   soil erosion and flooding risk. The abundance of woody resprouters is
   recognized in eastern Spain as a critical factor to ensure an efficient
   recovery of plant cover after fire.
   Post-fire restoration planning is addressed taking into account
   vegetation fragility to wildfires, together with soil erosion risk and
   soil moisture availability (physical features). Vegetation fragility is
   defined both in relation to spontaneous regeneration capacity of plant
   cover and in relation to the ability of keystone woody species topersist
   after fire. A synthetic indicator to asses wildland protection and
   restoration priorities in relation to wildland fires is developed by
   combining vegetation fragility and physical layers in a GIS.}},

Abstract = {{Under conditions of increased fire season length and area affected by
   fire, stocks of carbon stored in forests are at increased risk of
   burning. While much research has investigated the immediate loss of
   above ground and below ground carbon stocks through combustion during a
   fire, there has been little research on subsequent organic matter
   cycling in post-fire environments. Fire can introduce new organic matter
   to the litter layer through the formation of a post-fire litter layer
   composed of debris from fire induced plant stress or death. This litter
   may have different chemistry and decomposition dynamics to the pre-fire
   litter due to the changed pathway from plant to ground and the narrow
   age range of the debris. In this study, litters collected from two
   vegetation types (Pines and Eucalyptus dominated) and from adjacent
   areas either fire affected (FA) or not fire affected (NFA) were
   incubated as litter, or as water extracts of litter, in soils to
   determine fire induced changes in nutrient pools, microbial biomass and
   microbial activity. Post-fire litters contained more labile C (15 and 30
   mg C g native/pine litter(-1), respectively) than litters unaffected by
   fire (4 mg C g litter(-1)). Increased labile C concentration correlated
   (r(2) > 0.95) with increased microbial activity without a concurrent
   change in nitrogen (microbial) or phosphorus (resin and microbial)
   pools. Our results suggest that labile C in post-fire litter can alter
   microbial carbon cycling and that effects may be more pronounced under
   pine compared to native forest.}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to alter disturbance regimes including fires
   in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L) forests. Regarding the resilience
   of beech forests to fire it is questionable whether seeds of this
   non-serotinous obligate masting seeder find advantageous conditions in a
   post-fire environment. The probability of recruitment success has been
   shown to increase when fire coincides with a mast year. However, the
   fire-induced recruitment window is poorly defined, and it is unclear how
   other interacting factors influence its duration. We used a
   spacefor-time approach to model the relationships between post-fire
   beech recruitment, timing of seed mast events, and interacting
   environmental conditions using a zero-inflated model. Our results show
   that recruitment peaks 5-12 years after a fire, and continues throughout
   three decades post-fire. Beech recruitment in the post-fire period is
   driven by mast intensity interacting with (i) canopy opening as a
   consequence of progressive post-fire tree mortality and (ii) coverages
   of competing ground vegetation. Spring-summer moisture showed a weak
   positive effect on beech recruitment. We conclude that fires increase
   light availability, which in coincidence with a mast event results in
   pulses of beech recruitment. The delayed post-fire mortality of beech
   creates a recruitment window lasting for up to three decades, resulting
   in a higher-than-expected resilience of beech to individual fire
   disturbances. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   significantly related to vascular plant composition reflected variation
   in burn severity, rather than the salvage-harvesting treatment.
   Burned-unsalvaged mixedwood forest was compared to three burned forest
   types that were unsalvaged because they are not considered merchantable
   {[}jack pine (Pinus banksiana), jack pine-black spruce (Picea mariana),
   black spruce]. The four types of forest were quite different in terms of
   their structure and vascular plant communities. Burned, non-merchantable
   forest will not serve as reserves of the post-fire plant communities
   typical of commercially desirable mixedwood forest, but they may harbor
   small populations of fire specialist species. Burn severity and pre-fire
   forest composition have an important influence on the post-fire
   community, perhaps even more than the salvage-harvesting treatments we
   examined. Partial salvage harvesting may be an effective way to mitigate
   some of the potentially negative impacts of post-fire salvaging. (c)

Abstract = {{As wildfires become more frequent and severe in the United States,
   effective post-fire intervention is increasingly important for soil and
   plant conservation. Erosion control is often necessary after wildfire,
   but methods vary in effectiveness and impacts on vegetation. Little is
   known about the effects of hydroseed, an erosion control product, on
   post-fire plant recovery trajectories. Hydroseed was applied to control
   erosion of sandy soils after the 2011 wildfire in the Lost Pines region
   of Texas. Pre-fire, the region was dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus
   taeda), an obligate-seeder, and resprouting oak species, including sand
   post oak (Quercus margaretta). We investigated the effects of hydroseed
   and burn severity on pine and oak recovery in Bastrop State Park, within
   the Lost Pines. Forty-six permanent plots were surveyed 1999-2015;
   hydroseed was applied to 15 plots post-fire. Hydroseed inhibited P.
   taeda regeneration in the first post-fire year but had no subsequent
   effect on P. taeda seedling numbers, and no effect on Q. margaretta
   resprout numbers in any year. P. taeda seedling numbers were greatest in
   lower burn severity plots in the first post-fire year and increased
   following high rain in 2015. Q. margaretta resprout numbers were
   greatest in higher burn severity plots in the first post-fire year only.
   Our results suggest that hydroseed may reduce initial post-fire pine
   recruitment but is unlikely to permanently alter long-term woody plant
   community recovery in this region; burn severity may be a more important
   factor. Further research is warranted to examine the effects of
   hydroseed on herbaceous plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important process in California closed-cone pine forests;
   however spatial variability in post-fire stand dynamics of these forests
   is poorly understood. The 1995 Vision Fire in Point Reyes National
   Seashore burned over 5000 ha, initiating vigorous Pinus muricata (bishop
   pine) regeneration in areas that were forested prior to the fire but
   also serving as a catalyst for forest expansion into other locales. We
   examined the post-fire stand structure of P. muricata forest 14 years
   after fire in newly established stands where the forest has expanded
   across the burn landscape to determine the important factors driving
   variability in density, basal area, tree size, and mortality.
   Additionally, we estimated the self-thinning line at this point in stand
   development and compared the size-density relationship in this forest to
   the theorized (-1.605) log-log slope of Reineke's Rule, which relates
   maximum stand density to average tree size. Following the fire,
   post-fire P. muricata density in the expanded forest ranged from 500 to
   8900 live stems ha(-1) (median density = 1800 ha(-1)). Post-fire tree
   density and basal area declined with increasing distance to individual
   pre-fire trees, but showed little variation with other environmental
   covariates. Self-thinning (density-dependent mortality) was observed in
   nearly all stands with post-fire density >1800 stems ha(-1), and
   post-fire P. muricata stands conformed to the size-density relationship
   predicted by Reineke's Rule. This study demonstrates broad spatial
   variability in forest development following stand-replacing fires in
   California closed-cone pine forests, and highlights the importance of

Abstract = {{Post-fire forest regeneration is crucial to forest management. Three
   different restoration treatments including natural regeneration (NR),

   adopted in the Greater Hinggan Mountain area of China after a serious

   occurs naturally without intervention, AR comprises salvage logging
   followed by planting, while AP includes regeneration by removing dead
   trees, weeding, and tidying to promote seed germination. In this study,
   the objective was to detect and compare the effects of the three
   restoration treatments using radar indices derived from ALOS/PALSAR
   data. Four time-series SAR images were pre-processed to acquire the
   backscattering coefficients. Then the coefficients in both HH and HV
   polarization were examined and two radar vegetation indices were derived
   and evaluated, based on which, the post-fire forest dynamics under
   different restoration treatments were detected and compared. The results
   showed that the forests under NR presented a completely different

   This difference could be characterized by both the backscattering

Abstract = {{Boreal larch forests in eastern Siberia contain about half of the carbon
   accumulated in Eurasian forest communities, and fire is an important
   disturbance in this area, contributing to changes in forest composition
   and breaking the original succession trajectory. Assessing burn severity
   and environmental controls on post-fire larch recruitment is critical
   for understanding long-term effects of fire disturbance on forest
   succession in this region. A mega-fire that burned 8700 ha in the year
   2000 in the Great Xing' an Mountains provided an opportunity to study
   the effects of mixed-severity fire disturbance in larch forests. We
   sampled tree recruitment in 83 burned sites to address the question of
   how burn severity and site environment interact to influence the species
   composition and density of post-fire tree recruitment, and hence the
   successional trajectory of forest. We explored the hypothesis that the
   larch forest was more likely to replace itself rapidly
   ({''}self-replacement succession{''}) in areas of low-severity burn, but
   was more likely to be replaced by an early-seral community of broadleaf
   trees ({''}relay succession{''}) in areas of high-severity burn. Our
   analysis showed that post-fire conifer and broadleaf recruit densities
   were both negatively related to burn severity and understory cover.
   Environmental conditions (e.g. elevation, slope, aspect) had weaker
   influences than burn severity on post-fire tree densities, but played a
   stronger role in determining the relative proportion of conifer
   recruits. Broadleaf trees recruited abundantly in low-severity burns in
   upland areas, even though they were absent from most of the pre-fire
   sites. In contrast, coniferous trees recruited more abundantly in
   low-severity burns in valley bottom areas. The comparison of pre- and
   post-fire tree composition in the burned patches indicated that
   self-replacement succession was likely to occur in valley bottom areas
   that burned with low severity. Burned upland areas are more likely to
   experience an alternative, broadleaf-dominated trajectory of relay
   succession. The increase in the severity and frequency of fires due to
   climate warming may prompt shifts from a larch dominated forest to an
   increasingly birch dominated landscape, substantially altering landscape
   dynamics and ecosystem services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aims Changes in land cover resulting from the introduction of non-native
   pine plantations and subsequent pine invasion is increasingly affecting
   forest areas in the Southern Hemisphere, and having negative impacts on
   diverse ecosystem components. We studied the abundance, biophysical
   attributes, and flammability of litter in temperate forests modified by
   the introduction of the non-native Pinus radiata, and later by its
   post-fire invasion from adjacent sites. We also evaluated the short-term
   effects on litter of mechanical removal of P. radiata from post-fire
   invasion sites.
   Location North-western Patagonia, Argentina.
   Methods We measured abundance, depth, moisture content and determined
   species composition of litter samples collected at native forest,
   plantation, and post-fire invasion and removal sites. We also performed
   flammability tests on leaf litter samples of the dominant species from
   each habitat type. In all cases, litter traits from the modified
   habitats were compared with those obtained from native forest (reference
   system).
   Results Moisture content and litter species composition were notably
   affected by the alteration of habitat. A decrease in species richness
   and changes in the identity and abundance of the dominant species were
   the most remarkable shifts recorded in the modified habitats. While pine
   needles were mainly associated with parameters indicative of high leaf
   litter flammability, the opposite was found for leaves of the dominant
   native trees. The removal of invasive pines from early post-fire
   invasion did not reveal any biophysical changes in litter that would
   indicate a tendency towards the conditions found in native forest
   litter.
   Conclusions Pine needles as a novel element in litter found in
   pine-dominated habitats have a prominent impact on litter traits
   associated with alterations in key ecosystem properties in comparison
   with the reference system. For a short-term recovery of burned, invaded
   areas, additional ecological practices other than the removal of
   invasive trees should be conducted to successfully drive successional
   changes towards conditions similar to those found in native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plant encroachment on water-limited lands can induce a shift from
   biotic (plant)-controlled resource retention to abiotic
   (physical)-driven losses of critical soil resources. The
   biotic-to-abiotic shift occurs where encroachment propagates
   connectivity of runoff processes and amplified cross-scale erosion that,
   in-turn, promote ecohydrologic resilience of the post-encroachment
   community. We investigated these relationships for woodland-encroached
   sagebrush steppe in the Great Basin, USA, and evaluated wildfire as a
   mechanism to reverse the post-encroachment soil erosion feedback. We
   measured vegetation, soil properties, and runoff/erosion from
   experimental plots on burned and unburned areas of a late-succession
   woodland 1 and 2years post-fire. Our findings suggest that the
   biotic-to-abiotic shift and amplified cross-scale erosion occur where
   encroachment-induced bare ground exceeds 50-60\% and bare gaps between
   plant bases frequently extend beyond 1m. The trigger for amplified
   cross-scale erosion is formation of concentrated flow within the
   degraded intercanopy between trees. Burning in this study decreased
   ecohydrologic resilience of the late-succession woodland through
   herbaceous recruitment 2years post-fire. Increased intercanopy
   herbaceous productivity decreased connectivity of bare ground, improved
   infiltration, and reduced erosion, but the study site remained
   vulnerable to runoff and erosion from high-intensity rainfall. We
   conclude that burning can reduce woodland ecohydrologic resilience and
   that woodland encroachment-induced structural and functional
   ecohydrologic attributes may persist during high-intensity storms for an
   undetermined period post-fire. We cannot conclude whether wildfire
   reverses the woodland-induced soil erosion feedback on sagebrush
   rangelands. However, our results suggest that wildfire may provide a
   restoration pathway for sagebrush steppe by reducing woodland
   ecohydrologic resilience over time. Published 2013. This article is a

Abstract = {{The European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is one of the most ecologically
   and economically important tree species in Europe. Nonetheless,
   post-fire ecological processes in beech forests have only been
   marginally studied although they might become more important for forest
   management in the light of global climate change drought effects.
   Focusing on the Southern European Alps, where numerous forest fires have
   affected beech stands, we assessed temporal trends and detected factors
   that influence beech regeneration in beech forests burnt between 1970
   and 2012. Beech regeneration was found to occur abundantly in fire sites
   of mixed burn severity, and often co-occurred with light-demanding
   pioneer trees (mostly Betula pendula Roth). These pioneers declined in
   abundance from 20 years post-fire onwards, whereas beech dominance
   increased. Beech regeneration density was best explained in regression
   models by the canopy of remnant trees and the abundance of competing
   ground vegetation. As fire-injured beech trees slowly die back, the
   canopy gradually opens, favouring beech recruitment for as long as
   decades, depending on the light conditions. In contrast, dense layers of
   early post-fire colonisers may delay beech regeneration for many years.
   Generally, single fire events favour beech regeneration except in areas
   where the burn severity is extraordinarily high.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{The size and frequency of large wildfires in western North America have
   increased in recent years, a trend climate change is likely to
   exacerbate. Due to fuel limitations, recently burned forests resist
   burning for upwards of 30 years; however, extreme fire-conducive weather
   enables reburning at shorter fire-free intervals than expected. This
   research quantifies the outcomes of short-interval reburns in upland and
   wetland environments of northwestern Canadian boreal forests and
   identifies an interactive effect of post-fire drought. Despite
   adaptations to wildfire amongst boreal plants, post-fire forests at
   paired short- and long-interval sites were significantly different, with
   short-interval sites having lower stem densities of trees due to reduced
   conifer recruitment, a higher proportion of broadleaf trees, less
   residual organic material, and reduced herbaceous vegetation cover.
   Drought reinforced changes in proportions of tree species and decreases
   in tree recruitment, reinforcing non-resilient responses to
   short-interval reburning. Drier and warmer weather will increase the
   incidence of short-interval reburning and amplify the ecological changes
   such events cause, as wildfire activity and post-fire drought increase
   synergistically. These interacting disturbances will accelerate
   climate-driven changes in boreal forest structure and composition. Our
   findings identify processes of ongoing and future change in a
   climate-sensitive biome.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain coniferous forests of Southern Europe seem to be increasingly
   affected by large fires. Endemic Greek fir (Abies cephalonica) forests
   were among the most affected ecosystems by the 2007 extreme wildfires in
   Greece. The aim of this study is to investigate the pattern of post-fire
   regeneration of fir forest plant communities of Mount Parnitha National
   Park, in Attica (Greece), after a large wildfire. A network of 8
   severely burned sites across the mountain ridge was established in order
   to monitor natural regeneration of A. cephalonica as well as post-fire
   floristic composition and species richness. Field campaigns took place
   in two distinct time periods, one close to the fire event and one 8 to
   10 years after. Generalized linear models were used to explore the
   effects of distance and microhabitat variables on the post-fire
   regeneration of the Greek fir. Distance from the unburned patches, slope
   and cover of woody species significantly affected A. cephalonica
   seedling establishment and hence its natural post-fire regeneration.
   Floristic composition and plant species richness of the recovering fir
   communities changed through time. During the initial phase, high species
   richness was recorded, mainly because of the high contribution of
   herbaceous species. During the second period, species richness was lower
   and similar to that recorded in the unburned fir communities. It is
   during this period when the first seedlings of the Greek fir managed to
   establish, although their density is rather low to ensure full recovery

   in this ecosystem. The aim of the study presented here was to determine
   the distribution of Pinus, Cistus and other plants seeds around burned
   Pinus halepensis trees, and to measure the conditions related to seed
   germination in the upper soil layers in the same locations. The study
   was carried out in a 50-year old planted Pinus halepensis woodland that
   was burned down by a wildfire in July 1995. The variation of seedbank
   density was determined by collecting samples under the canopies of
   burned trees and in a nearby open area. Pine seedbank density decreased
   and that of Cistus and annuals increased with increasing distance from
   the burned trunks. Most pine seeds were present in the ash layer while
   those of the other plants were in the soil. In situ germination
   experiments showed that seedling density decreased with distance from
   the burned trunks while the proportion of pines in the seedling
   population increased. This was a result of seedbank variation and
   germination inhibition by the high pH conditions caused by the ash. The
   establishment of sparse pine seedling under the dead tree canopies
   insured their rapid development without interference by other plants and
   played a key role in the regeneration and stability of the pine woodland
   community. The concomitant mass germination of the perennial seeders in
   the rest of the area prevented invasion by annuals.}},

   effects of landscape context and topography on plant community

Abstract = {{Objective
   Our purpose was to characterize vegetation compositional patterns, tree
   regeneration, and plant diversity, and their relationships to landscape
   context, topography, and light availability across the margins of four
   stand-replacing subalpine burns.
   Location
   Four 1977 to 1978 burns east of the Continental Divide in Colorado: the
   Ouzel burn, a burn near Kenosha Pass, the Badger Mountain burn, and the
   Maes Creek burn.
   Methods
   Vegetation and environmental factors were sampled in 200 0.01-ha plots
   on transects crossing burn edges, and stratified by elevation. We
   utilized dissimilarity indices, mixed-effects models, and randomization
   tests to assess relationships between vegetation and environment.
   Results
   Three decades after wildfire, plant communities exhibited pronounced
   compositional shifts across burn edges. Tree regeneration decreased with
   increasing elevation and distance into burn interiors; concomitant
   increases in forbs and graminoids were linked to greater light
   availability. Richness was roughly doubled in high-severity burn
   interiors due to the persistence of a suite of native species occurring
   primarily in this habitat. Richness rose with distance into burns, but
   declined with increasing elevation. Only three of 188 plant species were
   non-native; these were widespread, naturalized species that comprised <
   1\% total cover.
   Conclusions
   These subalpine wildfires generated considerable, persistent increases
   in plant species richness at local and landscape scales, and a diversity
   of plant communities. The findings suggest that fire suppression in such
   systems must lead to reduced diversity. Concerns about post-fire
   invasion by exotic plants appear unwarranted in high-elevation
   wilderness settings.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding post-fire regeneration dynamics is an important task for
   assessing the resilience of forests and to adequately guide
   post-disturbance management. The main goal of this research was to
   compare the ability of different Landsat-derived spectral vegetation
   indices (SVIs) to track post-fire recovery occurring in burned forests
   of the central Apennines (Italy) at different development stages.
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference
   Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Burn
   Ratio 2 (NBR2) and a novel index called Forest Recovery Index 2 (FRI2)
   were used to compute post-fire recovery metrics throughout 11 years
   (2008-2018). FRI2 achieved the highest significant correlation
   (Pearson's r = 0.72) with tree canopy cover estimated by field sampling
   (year 2017). The Theil-Sen slope estimator of linear regression was
   employed to assess the rate of change and the direction of SVIs recovery
   metrics over time (2010-2018) and the Mann-Kendall test was used to
   evaluate the significance of the spectral trends. NDVI displayed the
   highest amount of recovered pixels (38\%) after 11 years since fire
   occurrence, whereas the mean value of NDMI, NBR, NBR2, and FRI2 was
   about 27\%. NDVI was more suitable for tracking early stages of the
   secondary succession, suggesting greater sensitivity toward non-arboreal
   vegetation development. Predicted spectral recovery timespans based on
   pixels with a statistically significant monotonic trend did not
   highlight noticeable differences among normalized SVIs, suggesting
   similar suitability for monitoring early to mid-stages of post-fire
   forest succession. FRI2 achieved reliable results in mid- to long-term
   forest recovery as it produced up to 50\% longer periods of spectral
   recovery compared to normalized SVIs. Further research is needed to
   understand this modeling approach at advanced stages of post-fire forest
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about the effects of fire on ecologically sensitive habitats
   have limited the use of prescribed fire in the management of forest
   riparian areas. Using a beyond-BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact)
   experimental design, we examined the effects of a 26-ha prescribed fire
   that burned upland and riparian areas of a first-order watershed, and
   compared this to five unburned sites examined from 1 to 7 years pre-fire
   and 1 year post-fire. We monitored pre- and post-fire riparian
   vegetation, large woody debris, sediment, water chemistry, periphyton,
   and benthic macroinvertebrates. The prescribed fire in the riparian zone
   was patchy in terms of intensity, consumption, and severity; it consumed
   79\% of the pre-fire fuel in the riparian zone, 34\% of the total
   surface fuel, and 90\% of the total ground fuel. The prescribed fire
   significantly reduced percent cover of surface vegetation and plant taxa
   richness in comparison to unburned sites but not plant diversity
   (Simpson's D). Community composition of understory riparian vegetation
   changed post-fire, most likely as a result of the reduction in taxa
   richness and cover. Riparian tree mortality ( > 11.5 cm DBH) was only
   4.4\% post-fire. Similarly, there was no post-fire change in large woody
   debris volume and recruitment, or fine sediment in pools (V-{*}).
   Post-fire, there were increases in some water chemistry parameters
   (SO4-, total P, Ca2+, and Mg2+) and a decrease in periphyton biomass;
   however, these changes were short-term, and recovery occurred in <= 1
   year. Macroinvertebrate community composition but not density, richness,
   or diversity was affected 10-19 d post-fire; composition recovered
   within 1 year. The trends observed in this study examining multiple
   abiotic and biotic parameters suggest that this prescribed fire either
   had no or short-lasting ( <= 1 year) impacts on Dark Canyon Creek and
   its riparian zone. The limited observed impacts are at least partially a
   result of the small portion ( < 20\%) of the watershed area burned,
   moderate topography, the low- to moderate-severity of the fire, and the
   relatively low precipitation (and thus, stream flow) that occurred
   post-fire. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a methodology based on the analysis of MODIS

   developed to estimate post-fire resilience of Alpine vegetation. To this
   end, satellite images of two vegetation indices (VIs), the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index
   (EVI) were used. The analysis was conducted on wildfire affected areas
   in the Lombardy region (Italy) between 2003 and 2007. Some land surface
   (LS) descriptors (i.e. mean and maximum VI, growing season start, end
   and length) were extracted to characterize the time evolution of the
   vegetation. The descriptors from a burned area were compared to those
   from an undisturbed adjacent control site by means of analysis of
   variance (one-way ANOVA). Post-fire resilience was estimated on the
   basis of the number of subsequent years exhibiting a statistical
   difference between burned area and control site. The same methodologies
   were also applied to events aggregated by main land cover (broadleaf
   forest, prairies and mixed forest). The averaged resilience of broadleaf
   forest was 5-6 years, whereas prairie ecosystems exhibited a faster
   response of 0-2 years. Phonological analysis revealed that fire induces
   a shift of the start and end of growing season in forest ecosystems but
   has no effect on prairies. The method provides a useful and quantitative
   insight into complex post-fire vegetation dynamics in the Alps from a

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of fire severity on soil properties and on
   post-fire regeneration and dynamics of vegetation over a period of 14
   years after a wildfire in moist pine forest on muck-peat soil with a
   thick layer of organic matter. We found that the fire markedly altered
   soil properties and, depending on its severity, differentially affected
   tree and shrub colonisation and development. Total N was most reduced in
   more severely burned areas, where it did not change even after 14 years.
   A fire-severity-dependent increase of Ca, P, K, Mg and the sum of basic
   cations persisted two or three years after the fire. This short-term
   pulse was the principal reason for rapid and abundant vegetation
   development during the first three years after the fire. From the
   beginning of succession, silver birch (Betula pendula) was dominant at
   all sites while Scots pine (Pious sylvestris) was of minor importance.
   The rates of tree species colonisation, birch development, and cover of
   all trees and shrubs were highest on more severely burned sites and
   lowest on slightly burned sites. Seedlings of anemochorous trees and
   shrubs emerged first (within 3-5 years after the fire); zoochorous
   species appeared much later, after the shrub layer developed. Seedling
   recruitment and development of tree species were inhibited on slightly
   burned sites by strong competition from herbaceous plants that survived
   the fire. The results indicate that distance from the source of pioneer
   tree species and the soil conditions prevailing in the first years after
   a fire can determine the composition and structure of vegetation in the
   early stages of post-fire succession. On moister and richer soil, the
   colonisation success of pioneer tree species increased with increasing
   fire-caused consumption of the organic soil layer. Early post-fire
   recruits may form the major source of canopy trees in late successional
   stands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forest land managers rely on predictions of tree mortality generated
   from fire behavior models to identify stands for post-fire salvage and
   to design fuel reduction treatments that reduce mortality. A key
   challenge in improving the accuracy of these predictions is selecting
   appropriate wind and fuel moisture inputs. Our objective was to evaluate
   postfire mortality predictions using the Forest Vegetation Simulator
   Fire and Fuels Extension (FVS-FFE) to determine if using representative
   fire-weather data would improve prediction accuracy over two default
   weather scenarios. We used pre- and post-fire measurements from 342
   stands on forest inventory plots, representing a wide range of
   vegetation types affected by wildfire in California, Oregon, and
   Washington. Our representative weather scenarios were created by using
   data from local weather stations for the time each stand was believed to
   have burned. The accuracy of predicted mortality (percent basal area)
   with different weather scenarios was evaluated for all stands, by forest
   type group, and by major tree species using mean error, mean absolute
   error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). One of the
   representative weather scenarios, Mean Wind, had the lowest mean error
   (4\%) in predicted mortality, but performed poorly in some forest types,
   which contributed to a relatively high RMSE of 48\% across all stands.
   Driven in large part by over-prediction of modelled flame length on
   steeper slopes, the greatest over-prediction mortality errors arose in
   the scenarios with higher winds and lower fuel moisture. Our results
   also indicated that fuel moisture was a stronger influence on post-fire
   mortality than wind speed. Our results suggest that using representative
   weather can improve accuracy of mortality predictions when attempting to
   model over a wide range of forest types. Focusing simulations
   exclusively on extreme conditions, especially with regard to wind speed,
   may lead to over-prediction of tree mortality from fire.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a recent increase in the frequency and extent of
   wildfires in interior Alaska, and this trend is predicted to continue
   under a warming climate. Although less well documented, corresponding
   increases in fire severity are expected. Previous research from boreal
   forests in Alaska and western Canada indicate that severe fire promotes
   the recruitment of deciduous tree species and decreases the relative
   abundance of black spruce (Picea mariana) immediately after fire. Here
   we extend these observations by (I) examining changes in patterns of
   aspen and spruce density and biomass that occurred during the first two
   decades of post-fire succession, and (2) comparing patterns of tree
   composition in relation to variations in post-fire organic layer depth
   in four burned black spruce forests in interior Alaska after 10-20 years
   of succession. We found that initial effects of fire severity on
   recruitment and establishment of aspen and black spruce were maintained
   by subsequent effects of organic layer depth and initial plant biomass
   on plant growth during post-fire succession. The proportional
   contribution of aspen (Populus tremuloides) to total stand biomass
   remained above 90\% during the first and second decades of succession in
   severely burned sites, while in lightly burned sites the proportional
   contribution of aspen was reduced due to a 40-fold increase in spruce
   biomass in these sites. Relationships between organic layer depth and
   stem density and biomass were consistently negative for aspen, and
   positive or neutral for black spruce in all four burns. Our results
   suggest that initial effects of post-fire organic layer depths on
   deciduous recruitment are likely to translate into a prolonged phase of
   deciduous dominance during post-fire succession in severely burned
   stands. This shift in vegetation distribution has important implications
   for climate-albedo feedbacks, future fire regime, wildlife habitat
   quality and natural resources for indigenous subsistence activities in

Abstract = {{Israel's largest natural Pinus halepensis Mill. forest is on the Mt.
   Carmel range and belongs to the distinct East Mediterranean genetic
   group. Most of this forest is the result of invasion of abandoned fields
   and grazing lands, resulting in a heterogeneous pine forest with an
   understory of broad-leaf shrubs and trees. Species composition,
   vegetation cover, pine-stand structure, and pine genetic diversity of
   plots in sites of known fire history, burned 5, 11, and 20 years ago,
   were studied with adjacent unburned sites forming a chronosequence.
   Except for annual species, no species replacement took place during
   post-fire succession. The main observed changes were in the cover of
   species and of plant life forms. The ratio of tree/dwarf-shrub cover was
   found to be linearly related to the number of years elapsed since the
   last fin. Therefore, this ratio could serve as an index to determine the
   successional stage of Aleppo pine stands with unknown fire history. It
   is estimated that 30-40 years are needed for full recovery of Aleppo
   pine stands after fire, depending upon site quality. The stands of
   post-fire regeneration are of uniform age and are less variable in their
   structure than unburned stands. The genetic distance among the various
   Pinus halepensis subpopulations was found to be very small; most of the
   genetic variability was due to within-subpopulations variability, with
   almost no variability among subpopulations. Alleles that an typical of
   West Mediterranean P. halepensis populations or of P. brutia, were found
   in mio post-fire subpopulations (stands), indicating pre-fire cross
   pollination between native Pious halepensis trees and trees in adjacent

   The conclusion is that fin has little effect on species composition and
   on vegetation structure, but that it alters the Aleppo pine stand

   with a soil seed bank increased in the early years, but then decreased
   through time. Facultative resprouters were at an intermediate position,
   with an increase in cover until mid-successional stages and then a
   decrease through time. The cover of the only obligate seeder with a
   canopy seed bank (P. brutia) followed a linear increasing trend during
   the succession. When species with the same regeneration mode were
   grouped, the same trends were observed with more explained variances. A
   few life-history traits were enough to explain the observed trends. Our
   study shows that regeneration mode is an explanatory functional grouping
   system for describing long-term post-fire dynamics of Mediterranean
   Basin woody species. We suggest that regeneration mode must be a major
   component of any vegetation or forest stand dynamics model in the
   Mediterranean Basin. This result has important implications for the
   management of Mediterranean Basin ecosystems, and can potentially be
   extrapolated to other Mediterranean-type fire-prone ecosystems.}},

   variables in logistic regression models; factors influencing scope of
   inference and model limitations; model validation; and management
   applications. Logistic regression is currently the most widely used and
   available technique for predicting post-fire tree mortality. Over 100
   logistic regression models have been developed to predict post-fire tree
   mortality for 19 coniferous species following wild and prescribed fires.
   The most widely used explanatory variables in post-fire tree mortality
   logistic regression models have been measurements of crown (e.g. crown
   scorch) and stem (e.g. bole char) injury. Prediction of post-fire tree
   mortality improves when crown and stem variables are used collectively.
   Logistic regression models that predict post-fire tree mortality are the
   basis of simple field tools and contribute to larger fire-effects
   models. Future post-fire tree mortality prediction models should include
   consistent definition of model variables, model validation and direct

Abstract = {{As vegetation recovers after disturbances such as fire its composition
   and structure systematically changes, affecting the availability of
   resources for fauna and mediating physical conditions. According to the
   habitat accommodation model, these changes drive a succession of animal
   species, which enter and leave according to their habitat requirements.
   While the response of ants to fire has been extensively studied, studies
   of ant communities in biomes with long fire-return intervals have been
   overwhelmingly short-term in nature. Here, we explore the response of
   ant species, functional groups and communities to time since fire using
   a uniquely long-term (>300 years) chronosequence in eucalypt woodlands
   of southwestern Australia. Marked non-monotonic vegetation structural
   changes occur in non-resprouting Eucalyptus salubris-dominated woodlands
   following fire, with tree and ground fuel cover peaking at intermediate
   periods post-fire. Hence, we predicted that changes in the occurrence of
   Dominant Dolichoderinae, Hot-Climate Specialist and Cold-Climate
   Specialist functional groups would mirror the non-monotonic changes in
   habitat complexity, as predicted by the habitat accommodation model.
   Overall ant species richness and composition did not show clear
   post-fire successional patterns, with extensive spatial turnover a
   likely factor. However, richness and abundance of ant functional groups
   broadly responded as predicted, with Dominant Dolichoderinae and
   Hot-Climate Specialists more prominent in more-open recently-burnt and
   long-unburnt habitat, and Cold-Climate Specialists more prominent in
   less open habitat at an intermediate time since fire. This matching,
   non-monotonic temporal pattern of changes in ant functional groups and
   vegetation structure suggests that ant functional group occurrence is
   mediated through changes in habitat, as posited by the habitat
   accommodation model, and not simply time since disturbance. Current fire
   management in E. salubris woodlands aims to minimise wildfire
   occurrence, which is consistent with the maintenance of ant functional
   diversity at a regional scale given the long time periods over which
   changes occur post-fire. The combination of recent large wildfires and
   predicted fire-facilitating climate changes suggest that future shifts
   in the relative dominance of ant functional groups are likely if fire
   management is unsuccessful in limiting wildfires occurring in mature
   woodlands. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus globulus is one of the most important pulpwood plantation
   species in the world, and nowadays it is present in most continents.
   Some of the regions where E. globulus plantations have been expanding
   have a high incidence of wildfires; therefore, knowing the factors
   affecting the fire resistance and resilience of this species is
   particularly important for forest management. This is the case of
   Portugal, where nearly 1.4 million ha of land burned in the last decade
   and where E. globulus has become the most widespread tree species. In
   this paper we assessed the short-term post-fire responses of E. globulus
   trees in four sites affected by wildfires, and investigated their
   potential relationships with fire severity descriptors and with tree and
   stand characteristics. One year after fire, individual tree mortality
   was low (3.9\%) but most trees (79.2\%) were top-killed (i.e. had stem
   mortality). Both post-fire tree mortality and top-kill increased with
   fire severity (expressed by maximum char height and/or char severity
   rating). Moreover, top-kill was positively related with vegetation cover
   and the proportion of pine trees in the stand, and was negatively
   related with tree diameter and the proportion of other broadleaved trees
   in the stand. The most common post-fire regeneration type among the
   sampled trees was basal resprouting (89.2\%), though 20.9\% had
   epicormic resprouting. The number of basal resprouts increased with char
   height, top-kill and diameter of the parent tree, and decreased with
   slope. In terms of post-fire growth, the height of the dominant resprout
   increased with the number of resprouts and with char severity, while it
   decreased in drier southern aspects. Results showed that E. globulus is
   a fire-resilient species with a very high probability of surviving fire;
   however, in forest plantations where trees are usually felled in short
   rotations (thus with limited size), individuals have a high probability
   of being top-killed. The presented models may be useful to help managers
   on the assessment of post-fire production losses and regeneration
   potential in E. globulus plantations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To examine the effects of frequent fires on species composition of the
   boreal forest in northern Mongolia, we investigated regeneration
   patterns, including reproductive pathways, post-fire seed sources, and
   site preferences, of four common tree species (Betula platyphylla, Larix
   sibirica, Picea obovata, and Pinus sibirica). Regeneration patterns
   differed among B. platyphylla, L. sibirica, and the two evergreen
   conifers. B. platyphylla regenerated vigorously only after fire
   irrespective of the presence/absence of nearby seed sources, whereas
   post-fire regeneration of L. sibirica was more dependent on the presence
   of nearby seed sources. These two species did not regenerate in mature
   stands where mature trees of these species were growing. In contrast, no
   post-fire recruitment of P. obovata and P. sibirica was observed,
   whereas continuous recruitment of these species was observed in mature
   stands. The frequent fires that accompany illegal logging may result in
   larger burned areas and increase the risk of local extinctions of seed
   sources. The enlargement of burned areas is likely to favor post-fire
   recruitment of B. platyphylla. Seed dispersal limitation seems to have
   less effect on B. platyphylla than on the other species because of the
   wider seed dispersal range and vegetative reproduction capability of
   this species. Consequently, fires in the northern Mongolian boreal
   forest likely promote the relative dominance of B. platyphylla and

Abstract = {{The practice of fire suppression across the western United States over
   the past century has led to dense forests, and when coupled with drought
   has contributed to an increase in large and destructive wildfires.
   Forest management efforts aimed at reducing flammable fuels through
   various fuel treatments can help to restore frequent fire regimes and
   increase forest resilience. Our research examines how different fuel
   treatments influenced burn severity and post-fire vegetative stand
   dynamics on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, in east-central Arizona,
   U.S.A. Our methods included the use of multitemporal remote sensing data
   and cloud computing to evaluate burn severity and post-fire vegetation
   conditions as well as statistical analyses. We investigated how forest
   thinning, commercial harvesting, prescribed burning, and resource
   benefit burning (managed wildfire) related to satellite measured burn
   severity (the difference Normalized Burn Ratio - dNBR) following the
   2013 Creek Fire and used spectral measures of post-fire stand dynamics
   to track changes in land surface characteristics (i.e., brightness,
   greenness and wetness). We found strong negative relationships between
   dNBR and post-fire greenness and wetness, and a positive non-linear
   relationship between dNBR and brightness, with greater variability at
   higher severities. Fire severity and post-fire surface changes also
   differed by treatment type. Our results showed harvested and thinned
   sites that were not treated with prescribed fire had the highest
   severity fire. When harvesting was followed by a prescribed burn, the
   sites experienced lower burn severity and reduced post-fire changes in
   vegetation greenness and wetness. Areas that had previously experienced
   resource benefit burns had the lowest burn severities and the highest
   post-fire greenness measurements compared to all other treatments,
   except for where the prescribed burn had occurred. These results suggest
   that fire treatments may be most effective at reducing the probability
   of hazardous fire and increasing post-fire recovery. This research
   demonstrates the utility of remote sensing and spatial data to inform
   forest management, and how various fuel treatments can influence burn
   severity and post-fire vegetation response within ponderosa pine forests
   across the southwestern U.S.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between fire severity (measured as the degree of organic
   soil layer consumption) and species regeneration strategy has been
   suggested to explain early post-fire vegetation dynamics in coniferous
   forests. To test this hypothesis we analyzed 14 years of succession on
   permanent plots after a wildfire in moist Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris
   L.) forest on muck-peat soil in southern Poland. Plots were established
   at heavily, partly and slightly burned sites, as well as in unburned
   forest. In the first three post-fire years, establishment was best for
   vascular plant invaders (regenerating from seeds transported after the
   fire) on heavily burned plots, seed bankers on partly burned plots, and
   vegetatively regenerating sprouters on slightly burned plots. In the
   third year after the fire, cover of bryophyte species was significantly
   higher on heavily burned plots than on less burned plots. This initial
   response of species strongly influenced the composition of understory
   vegetation in subsequent years. During the 14-year period the changes in
   vegetation were greatest on heavily burned plots, less on partly burned
   plots, and least on slightly burned plots. Birch woods developed on all
   burned sites, but the understory vegetation differed significantly in
   composition and cover between heavily burned and less burned plots. On
   the more severely burned plots, strong competition from developing tree
   invaders hindered understory growth. On slightly burned plots, where
   herb sprouter cover increased most markedly, bryophytes disappeared over
   the course of nine years. The results indicate that the spatial
   variability of fire severity in moist pine forest leads to long-lasting
   heterogeneity of post-fire forest communities, whose diversity will
   persist for decades.}},

   on the following woody perennial plants: Anthyllis hermanniae L.,
   Asparagus acutifolius L., Cistus creticus L., Pinus brutia Ten., Quercus
   coccifera L. and Sarcopoterium spinosum ( L.) Spach. Five years after
   fire, the post-fire treatments of log and branch barriers had no
   positive effect on groundcover. On the contrary, we found more exposed
   bare soil and rocks in the south treated plots compared to the untreated
   plots. A higher number of pine seedlings was observed on the treated
   south slopes and the untreated north slope. Higher pine mortality rates
   were observed in the south slopes and especially in the untreated site.
   Pine seedling growth was not affected by post-fire treatments. The
   highest density of C. creticus seedlings was found in the southern
   untreated plot, where the highest mortality rate was also observed. The
   construction of log and branch barriers had an adverse effect on Q.
   coccifera plants and consequently on the whole burned area revegetation

   effect on seedling density of A. hermanniae and A. acutifolius. The

   within 2 areas in the Sierra Nevada that burned in forest fires in 2004.
   Our goals were to describe bumble bee abundance and species richness in
   a post-fire landscape, to compare results from chaparral-dominated
   upland vegetation with results from interspersed patches of riparian
   vegetation, and to identify characteristics of individual chaparral
   stands that might make some stands more valuable to bumble bees than
   others. We captured 2,494 bumble bees of 12 species, and used Bayesian
   hierarchical modeling to determine that bumble bee abundance was
   substantially greater in riparian plots (modeled capture rate (x) over
   bar = 1.10 +/- 0.31 {[}SD] bees/survey in 2015, and 2.96 +/- 0.83
   bees/survey in 2016) than in upland plots ((x) over bar = 0.47 +/- 0.07
   bees/survey in 2015, and 1.27 +/- 0.18 bees/survey in 2016), which
   comprised a mix of chaparral shrubs and associated herbaceous plants.
   Modeled species richness was also greater in riparian plots, with an
   average mean richness of 4.1 +/- 1.8 bumble bee species in riparian
   plots versus 2.3 +/- 1.3 species in upland plots across the 2 years of
   the study. Within upland and riparian areas, plots dominated by
   herbaceous vegetation had greater abundance and species richness. One
   chaparral shrub species, bearclover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), was foraged
   on preferentially over all other shrub species and over all but 1 forb
   taxon, and was associated with increased occupancy probability in the
   Vosnesensky bumble bee (Bombus vosnesenskii), the most abundant bumble
   bee species on our study plots. A complex of closely related herbaceous
   species in the genus Phacelia, commonly associated with upland chaparral
   in our study area, was the plant taxon most frequently used by bumble
   bees, and appeared to be particularly important during midsummer after
   bearclover flowers became scarce. Our findings suggest that post-fire
   chaparral communities are generally less intensively used by bumble bees
   than nearby riparian vegetation but may nevertheless provide important
   habitat. When chaparral removal is part of post-fire forest regeneration
   strategies, bumble bees will likely benefit from retention of a mosaic
   of upland habitat patches dominated by herbaceous vegetation and, in our
   study area, bearclover, which may provide foraging resources throughout
   the life cycle of local bumble bee colonies. Because habitat
   characteristics affected the occupancy of individual bumble bee species
   differently, managers should consider foraging preferences of target
   bumble bee species when making land management decisions. (C) 2017 The

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{422-431}},
Abstract = {{In view of the importance of facilitative interactions between plants,
   nurse-based planting has been proposed as a restoration technique for
   Mediterranean vegetation. However, facilitation efficiency is known to
   depend on the environmental context and the particular pair of
   interacting species. Understanding these context- and pair-specific
   dependences is fundamental to understanding Mediterranean vegetation
   dynamics and to improving the use of nurse-based plantation for
   restoration. We assessed the effectiveness of nurse-based plantation and
   the significance for post-fire restoration of some assembly rules
   mediated by facilitation. In two nearby areas of different burning ages,
   we compared seedling establishment of 13 tall shrubs and trees planted
   in open ground and under nurses. Nurses and planted seedlings were
   selected from different life-forms. Tests of the assembly rules were
   provided by the partitioning of the statistical interaction effect
   between nurse and planted seedling life-forms in a two-factor design.
   Nurse-based plantation increased seedling survival 2-9 times compared to
   plantation in open ground, depending on the year. The higher efficiency
   of nurse-based plantation was consistent for the two burned areas and
   occurred in many species even in years with contrasting rainfall. We
   detected pair-specific differences in the efficiency of facilitation.
   This pair-specificity was partly explained by the dependence between
   life-forms of nurse and guest species, suggesting the existence of
   assembly rules. Our results confirm that nurse-based plantation would be
   an appropriate post-fire restoration technique in Mediterranean
   mountains under dry-subhumid climate, but suggest that attention to the
   life-form assemblage rules is needed for an efficient implementation of
   such technique.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Do abiotic environmental filters or time-since-fire (TSF)
   explain more variability in post-fire vegetation assembly? Do these
   influences vary between vegetation structure and composition, and across
   spatial scales?
   Location: Sonoran Desert of southwestern Arizona, US.
   Methods: We measured perennial vegetation in a chronosequence of 13
   fires (8-33 yr TSF) spanning a broad regional gradient. The relative
   influence of environmental filters (topography and climate) and TSF were
   compared as predictors of long-term, post-fire vegetation assembly.
   Analyses considered different measures of vegetation structure (cover,
   height and density) and scales of community organization (species
   composition, structure and landscape).
   Results: Species and growth form composition did not exhibit directional
   responses with increasing TSF, but sorted along abiotic gradients.
   Differences in vegetation cover and height between burned and unburned
   control areas were attributed primarily to gradients of topography and
   climate. In contrast, vegetation density initially increased in burned
   areas but declined to pre-burn levels with increasing TSF. The strongest
   predictors of landscape-scale recovery of vegetation cover, height and
   density were elevation, post-fire precipitation and average annual
   precipitation, respectively. Recovery of vegetation height was
   positively correlated with precipitation in the first year following
   fire, suggesting that abiotic conditions of the immediate post-fire
   environment may drive long-term variability in vegetation structure.
   Conclusions: We find substantial evidence that environmental filters,
   rather than TSF, drive the majority of variability in long-term,
   post-fire vegetation assembly within the Sonoran Desert. Careful
   consideration of spatial variability in abiotic conditions may benefit
   post-fire vegetation modelling, as well as fire management and
   restoration strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean, non-serotinous pinewoods are suffering an
   increasing occurrence of high-severity crown fires that usually drive
   vegetation shifts to fire-adapted communities and a decrease in pine
   dominated area. Here we used a case-study approach on a large area
   dominated by Pinus nigra Am. ssp. salzmannii burned in 1998 to gain
   further understanding of the relative importance of different factors
   related to local topography (elevation, aspect, slope, curvature),
   pre-fire vegetation (land-use history, canopy cover) and fire behavior
   (burn severity, presence of unburned patches) as drivers of post-fire
   regeneration dynamics. The results find that pine shows locally
   resilient responses driven mainly by factors related to fire effects
   (presence of unburned patches) and the characteristics of the pre-fire
   vegetation (i.e. stable forest areas). When fire-induced changes from
   pine dominance to other types of vegetation occurred, landscape 15 years
   post-fire was dominated by woody vegetation, with some rare grassland
   communities emerging under very specific conditions (mountain ridges,
   hilltops and rocky sites). Conversion from forest to shrubland occurred
   mainly in the most xeric sites (south-facing areas, in some cases with
   steep slopes) and areas dominated by young pine stands prior to the
   fire. We found manageable factors such as the pre-fire structure and
   composition of the vegetation strongly determine the occurrence of
   post-fire regeneration trajectories dominated by tree species
   regeneration. This knowledge can be used to define preventive management
   strategies oriented to direct regeneration dynamics in anticipation of
   fire occurrence. At landscape level, managing forest fuels to favor the
   occurrence of unburned patches and modify their spatial distribution
   along the burned landscape will favor a more resilient pine response. At
   stand level, adjusting silvicultural interventions to favor the natural
   establishment of late-successional tree species will favor post-fire oak
   regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{49-62}},
Abstract = {{Post-fire mulch and seeding treatments, often applied on steep, severely
   burned slopes immediately after large wildfires, are meant to reduce the
   potential of erosion and establishment of invasive plants, especially
   non-native plants, that could threaten values at risk. However, the
   effects of these treatments on native vegetation response post fire are
   little studied, especially beyond one to two years. We compared species
   richness, diversity, and percent canopy cover of understory plants one,
   two, three, four, and six years after immediate post-fire application of
   wood strand mulch, agricultural wheat straw mulch, hydromulch + seed
   with locally adapted native grasses, seed only with locally adapted
   native grasses with no mulch, and untreated (no mulch or grass seeding)
   after the 2005 School Fire in Washington, USA. For wood strand mulch
   treatments, mean canopy cover of grasses and forbs was low, varying from
   3 \% to 20 \% in post-fire years two through six; whereas wheat straw
   mulch had the lowest mean cover of grasses, <1 \%, and the highest
   canopy cover of both forbs and shrubs, each >29 \% in post-fire years
   two through six. Plots hydromulched and seeded with grass, and those
   seeded with grass but not mulched, tended to have higher grass cover
   than other treatments and untreated plots over the six years. Species
   richness and diversity was highest for the hydromulch + seed treatment.
   Ten non-native species were found, but never with more than 2 \% canopy
   cover, each. Although the inference of our small-plot work is limited,
   our results suggest that post-fire rehabilitation treatments apparently

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Ecological memory, often determined by the extent and type of
   retained biological legacies present following disturbance, may produce
   persistent landscape patterns. However, after fire, the persistence or
   switch to an alternative state may depend on the complex interplay of
   ecological memory (biological legacies) and potential effects of new
   external factors influencing the post-fire environment. The current
   study assesses both the strength of ecological memory resulting from
   biological legacies of pre-burn vegetation types as well as post-fire
   effects of livestock.
   2. Following a severe fire in 1999, we set up a network of long-term
   exclosures to examine the effects of legacies and cumulative herbivory
   by cattle on fuel types, amounts, distribution, flammability and
   microenvironmental conditions in two post-fire communities representing
   alternative fire-driven states: pyrophobic Nothofagus pumilio subalpine
   forests and pyrophytic Nothofagus antarctica tall shrublands in
   northwestern Patagonia, Argentina.
   3. Our results show that the retained post-disturbance legacies of tall
   shrublands and subalpine forests largely determine fuel and flammability
   traits of the post-fire plant communities 16 years after fire. The
   importance of biological legacies retained from the unburned plant
   communities was reflected by the substantially higher amounts of total
   fine fuel, greater vertical and horizontal fuel continuity and the
   higher temperatures reached during experimental tissue combustion at
   post-fire shrubland compared to post-fire forest sites.
   4. We show that herbivores may produce antagonistic effects on
   flammability by decreasing tissue ignitability, total fine fuel and
   litter depth, and disrupting the vertical and horizontal fine fuel
   continuity, therefore reducing the probability of fire propagation.
   However, cattle can increase ratios of dead to live fine fuels, reduce
   soil moisture, and inhibit tree height growth to canopy size,
   consequently impeding the development of a closed pyrophobic forest
   canopy.
   5. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that biological
   legacies, most importantly the dominance by pyrophytic woody plants that
   resprout vigorously vs. the dominance by pyrophobic obligate seeders,
   favour fuel and flammability characteristics at the community level
   which reinforce the mechanisms maintaining pyrophytic shrublands vs.
   pyrophobic forests. Herbivory by introduced cattle can partially blur
   sharp pyrophobic/pyrophytic state boundaries by promoting the
   development of novel post-fire transitional states.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape models are comprehensive tools that allow for an understanding
   of landscape dynamics and a means of deriving future projections in the
   context of global change. Vegetation and ecological processes such as
   growth, death or regeneration are essential components of forest
   landscape dynamics, but their inclusion in landscape-level modelling
   frameworks is not straightforward as there is a trade-off between model
   feasibility, desirable complexity and the inclusion of relevant
   ecological processes. If models are to project future landscape
   dynamics, climatic influence on vegetation processes needs to be
   integrated; however, this usually leads to a major increment in model
   complexity. Here, a post-fire regeneration model (in terms of tree
   species) and a growth model (in terms of basal areas) is presented for
   Mediterranean forests including climate influences on such processes.
   The model captures vegetation dynamics at the stand level and accounts
   for post-fire regeneration and vegetation growth at the landscape level,
   with inclusion of the dynamically influencing effect of climate. The
   model was calibrated with 7709 inventory data plots and validated with
   233 burned plots in the Mediterranean region of Catalonia (NE Spain).
   Results show that our model is able to accurately predict tree species
   post-fire regeneration and biomass growth. They also show that
   integration of climatic information represents a significant improvement
   on the predictive accuracy of the model. Overall, this study presents a
   generic approach to extend local vegetation dynamics information to the
   landscape level; furthermore, allowing the projection of vegetation
   dynamics under changing climatic conditions.}},

   forb cover, non-native graminoid cover and non-native species richness.
   In addition, 25 non-native species occurred exclusively in mulched
   areas; collectively, these responses contributed to more homogenous
   plant communities in mulched areas than in unmulched areas in 2015. In
   contrast, mulch had no effect on total plant cover, and conifer
   regeneration densities were generally unaffected with the exception of a
   slight positive effect on Douglas-fir. We recommend more stringent
   testing for weed-free certification and that funding for non-native

Abstract = {{We estimated post-fire population trajectories, and analyzed the effect
   of fire recurrence on the post-fire recovery of seven different fire
   histories in the Central Monte. The structure of stems showed that
   un-burned woodlands and woodlands with the longest post-fire recovery
   time, presented higher proportion of stems with basal diameter (BD) > 5
   cm. On sites with higher recurrence of fires, the stems with BD > 5 cm
   almost disappeared. Tree height and crown diameter showed a significant
   decrease at sites recently burned, and this pattern was reinforced in
   areas with recurrent fires. Results suggest that the structure of
   woodland in the southeast of the Province of Mendoza in Argentina has
   been strongly controlled by fire history. Fire generates a population
   dominated by individuals with numerous smaller-sized stems, which
   becomes more evident in environments where fire recurrence is higher.
   Structural changes induced by fire indicate that logging may not be
   possible in the area. The development of forestry practices for
   post-fire management is needed for the burned areas. An increase in fire
   frequency is expected in the area, therefore this would cause the
   modification in the structure of the Prosopis flexuosa population.
   Furthermore, this will lead to the conversion from woodland to
   shrubland, and the loss of its capacity for natural recovery. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Exotic grass invasions are often facilitated by disturbances, which
   provide opportunities for invasion by releasing pulses of resources
   available to invaders. Where disturbances such as prescribed fire are
   used as a management tool, there is a pressing need to identify
   ecosystem attributes associated with susceptibility to
   disturbance-induced invasion. In the Great Basin of the western United
   States, expansion of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum is
   transforming native ecosystems. In this study we examined long-term
   understory plant community responses to experimental prescribed fire and
   post-fire seeding treatments in Great Basin pinyon-juniper woodlands. We
   asked (1) how long-term ecosystem resistance to fire-induced B. tectorum
   invasion varies along major abiotic and biotic gradients, and (2)
   whether post-fire seeding of perennial species promotes perennial plant
   establishment and increases resistance to invasion. Fourteen years after
   burning, we found that resistance to invasion was high on relatively
   cool and moist sites (higher elevation), but that the warmer and drier
   (low- to mid-elevation) burned sites had become heavily invaded by B.
   tectorum. Post-fire B. tectorum dominance was highest in sites with high
   pre-fire tree cover, where residual and newly established native
   perennial plant cover was limited following fire. We found that seeding
   perennial species after burning decreased invasibility in sites with low
   resistance. Seeding a mix of native perennial shrubs, forbs, and grasses
   was more effective at increasing perennial cover and inhibiting B.
   tectorum invasion than seeding a mix of non-native perennial grasses.
   Our results highlight the need for long-term studies to evaluate plant
   community responses to prescribed fire, as important treatment
   differences were not captured in a shorter (3-4year) post-fire
   monitoring period.}},

Abstract = {{Due to climate changes, the interest in the post-fire recovery of forest
   communities not adapted to wildfires, such as Greek fir (Abies
   cephalonica) forests, has increased. In this study, the post-fire
   recovery of the burned A. cephalonica forest of Parnitha National Park
   (central Greece) was investigated after a stand-replacing fire occurred
   in summer 2007, as well as the performance of A. cephalonica plantings
   in the post-fire conditions. The research focused on the estimation of
   the A. cephalonica stand reproductive capacity without fire, the
   evaluation of the post-fire regeneration of the burned stands, and the
   monitoring of the plantations performance after the fire in the area.
   Then, based on the field and laboratory data, the post-fire recovery
   process of A. cephalonica was evaluated by application of a simplified
   form of the comprehensive causal framework for ecological succession
   estimation in open site, developed by Pickett et al. (1987), adapted to
   the study conditions. According to the findings of the study, stand seed
   crop without fire was high, while seed quality was found extremely low.
   In the burned area, no A. cephalonica seedling recruitment was observed
   during the three years after the fire. A. cephalonica plantings
   exhibited a medium overall survival rate (65.3\%), while seedlings
   growth was very slow. Thus, we can suppose that an ecological succession
   process may occur in the burned area, if no human interventions applied,
   and species adapted to wildfires (mainly shrubs and herbaceous) will
   dominate in the area. However, planting of A. cephalonica seedlings
   could contribute to the species participation in the post-fire

Abstract = {{The study reported here describes for the first time the similarity
   between pre- and post-fire spatial patterns of the trees in a
   Mediterranean pine forest demonstrating that the pre-fire ancestor
   microsite is occupied also by the next generation. Although Aleppo pine
   Pinus halepensis Mill. is an obligatory post-fire seeder, it is adapted
   to regenerate in its pre-fire growing microsite, thus keeping suitable
   growing sites From generation to generation. We studied the effect of
   the dead burned adult pines on the density and size of their recruited
   saplings 2, 5, 11 and 20 yr after fire. A comparison of pine sapling
   density and size was made between the `near' zone (under the former
   effect of the burned canopy) and the `far' zone (beyond the former
   effect of the burned canopy).
   In the site 2 yr after fire, seedling density was 56\% higher in the
   `far' zone than in the `near' zone, but seedling size was similar.
   However in the site 20 yr after fire, densities were similar in both
   zones, but the size was bigger by 89\% in the `near' zone. Thus,
   population recruitment after fire seems to peak near the burned pine
   trees rather than at a distance from them, in contrast to Janzen's
   original `distance hypothesis' model suggested for undisturbed
   rainforest. Here we present a new hypothetical model for the spatial
   pattern of post-fire regeneration of obligate seeder tree species
   forming open forests. It is proposed that in such trees the microsites
   which were kept by the burned adult trees, which are killed by the fire,
   are also the Favorable regeneration microsite for the post-fire
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire salvage logging is widely implemented worldwide, but there is
   an increasing concern about its potential impact on the ecosystem.
   Moreover, there is scant information about the effect of salvage logging
   on ecosystem processes mediated by species interactions. We manipulated
   a burnt pine forest to experimentally analyze the effect of burnt-wood
   management on the colonization of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) mediated by
   acorn dispersal by Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius). Three replicates
   of three treatments were established in an 18-ha plot: salvage logging
   (SL), non-intervention (NI), and partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling
   and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass in situ). We
   hypothesized that different burnt-wood management could alter jays'
   landscape perception and thus the pattern of seed dispersal and seedling
   recruitment. We monitored jay abundance in each treatment for three
   winters and three breeding periods, and jay flights of potential acorn
   dispersal between nearby oak trees and the treatments. We also searched
   for oak seedlings recruited in the experimental plot for five years
   following the fire. Jays were recorded significantly more times (87\%)
   in NI, and movements to this treatment during the acorn dispersal period
   were also more frequent (81\% of the flights). Oak seedlings were also
   more abundant in NI (ca. 55\%) than in SL or PCL (ca. 25\% each),
   despite a strong effect of small remnants of live pines. The results
   show that the burnt forest, if unsalvaged, still provides a suitable
   habitat for jays, while salvage logging reduces the strength of this key
   plant-animal interaction for oak natural regeneration. Nonintervention
   policies after a forest fire therefore provide the opportunity for
   adaptive management that helps reduce restoration costs and increase the
   resilience of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Where threatened species persist in multiple use landscapes, management
   activities, such as prescribed burning, may influence the availability
   of resources for those species. We examined how time since fire can
   influence food resources for the endangered Carnaby's cockatoo
   (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) in banksia woodlands of southwestern
   Australia. Tree density and cone productivity of dominant plant species,
   Banksia attenuata and Banksia menziesii, were compared across 44 sites
   of varying post-fire aged vegetation. The number of Carnaby's cockatoos
   that could be supported in banksia woodlands was estimated using the
   bird's energetic requirements and seed energy content. Banksia attenuata
   produced more cones at sites aged 10-30 years since fire in both survey
   years, while cone productivity for B. menziesii was highest in very old
   sites (>35 years since fire) in one year only. Higher numbers of
   Carnaby's cockatoos were predicted to be supported in vegetation aged
   between 14-30 years since fire, peaking in vegetation aged 20-25 years.
   The current distribution of post-fire aged vegetation within this area
   (>60\% burnt within the last 7 years) is predicted to support 2725
   Carnaby's cockatoos, representing 25-35\% of the estimated birds reliant
   on the area. Our results indicate that food resources are influenced by
   time since fire and, consequently, if optimising food resources was an
   objective, may be manipulated by altering burning patterns. While human
   and asset protection is a priority for prescribed burning, management of
   landscapes for improved persistence of threatened species is also
   important and complex trade-offs will have to be considered. (C) 2014

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Based on short-term experimental data, facilitative interactions
   between woody plants (nurse-recruit interactions) have been described as
   essential for the restoration of Mediterranean forests. However, the
   long-term effects of nurse plants on vegetation dynamics are unknown.
   This study aims to project post-fire vegetation dynamics from easily
   retrieved data, and to asses the long-term contribution of nurse plants
   to forest restoration.
   2. In an area burned 20 years ago, we compared post-fire dynamics in
   three states of regeneration: pioneer scrubland; spontaneous pine
   regeneration stands; and late successional scrubland. For each
   regeneration state, we obtained an interaction matrix with the frequency
   of recruitment of a given species under the canopy of every other
   species in the community. These matrices provided the raw data to
   develop Markov chain models of community dynamics. We used sensitivity
   analyses to explore how small shifts in replacement probabilities
   between species (or between functional groups) may affect the similarity
   of the projected community to an undisturbed reference community.
   3. Plots in the pioneer state had the lowest frequency of facilitative
   interactions. Matrix projection showed that, under the current frequency
   of facilitation, these pioneer scrublands would remain so in the long
   term. By contrast, the building state had the highest frequency of
   facilitation, and its projection suggested that it should reach a steady
   state very similar to the reference community. These results confirm
   that nurse facilitative effects are fundamental for a secondary
   successional trajectory of the post-fire dynamics.
   4.Sensitivities showed that secondary succession may be launched in the
   pioneer state by increasing the frequency of seedlings of tall shrubs,
   evergreen and deciduous trees under small shrubs.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our Markov chain successional model is an
   analytical tool which can be applied rapidly and easily to determine
   successional trajectories for forest restoration. It allows: (i)
   evaluation of post-fire dynamics and identification of areas in need of
   intensive intervention (i.e. where secondary succession remains arrested
   leading to stasis in the pioneer state); (ii) assessment of the role of
   long-term facilitative nurse effects on restoration; and (iii)
   identification of species-pair combinations and functional nurse groups
   of value for further planting efforts.}},

   averaging 1.1Mgha(-1) at our 24-year post-fire site, with additions

   non-linear temporal trends, with maximum loadings occurring 14 years

   1000-h fuel accumulation slowed after 20 years post-fire (reached
   124.6Mgha(-1)), concurrently with similar to 90\% snag fall and
   fragmentation. Maximum herbaceous fuel loading averaged 0.73Mgha(-1) at
   our 5-year post-fire sites, but only averaged 0.02Mgha(-1) at all sites
   thereafter. Live shrub biomass accumulation slowed after 21 years
   post-fire, averaging 14.3Mgha(-1) at our 24-year post-fire site.
   Managers can use post-fire temporal fuel dynamics to help facilitate the
   restoration of fire regimes while mitigating undesirable fire effects.}},

Abstract = {{We studied patterns of small mammal abundance and species richness in
   post-fire habitats by sampling 33 plots (225 m(2) each) representing
   different stages of vegetation recovery after fire. Small mammal
   abundance was estimated by live trapping during early spring 1999 and
   vegetation structure was sampled by visual estimation at the same plots.
   Recently-burnt areas were characterised by shrubby and herbaceous
   vegetation with low structural variability, and unburnt areas were
   characterised by well developed forest cover with high structural
   complexity. Small mammal abundance and species richness decreased with
   time elapsed since the last fire (from 5 to at least 50 years), and
   these differences were associated to the decreasing cover of short
   shrubs as the post-fire succession of plant communities advanced.
   However, relationships between vegetation structure and small mammals
   differed among areas burned in different times, with weak or negative
   relationship in recently burnt areas and positive and stronger
   relationship in unburnt areas. Furthermore, the abundance of small
   mammals was larger than expected from vegetation structure in plots
   burned recently whereas the contrary pattern was found in unburned
   areas. We hypothesised that the pattern observed could be related to the
   responses of small mammal predators to changes in vegetation and
   landscape structure promoted by fire. Fire-related fragmentation could
   have promoted the isolation of forest predators (owls and carnivores) in
   unburned forest patches, a fact that could have produced a higher
   predation pressure for small mammals. Conversely, small mammal
   populations would have been enhanced in early post-fire stages by lower
   predator numbers combined with better predator protection in areas
   covered by resprouting woody vegetation. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS. All

Abstract = {{We studied medium-term dynamics of fire effects on catchment runoff and
   sediment yield in a dry-Mediterranean area in Alicante, E Spain. The
   study area was a mixed forest and agricultural terraced landscape that
   was affected by a wildfire in August 1998. We measured runoff and
   sediment yield in two catchments - burned and unburned - during the
   first seven years after the wildfire. Post-fire vegetation cover
   dynamics were also monitored. Total runoff and sediment yield in the
   burned catchment (35 mm and 4563 kg ha(-1), respectively) were
   considerably greater than in the unburned catchment (0.03 mm, and 0.12
   kg ha(-1)). Annual runoff and sediment yield increased with time after
   fire until the third post-fire year, and then decreased progressively.
   However, even five years after the wildfire, differences in annual
   runoff and sediment yield between the burned and the unburned catchments
   were still about two orders of magnitude. Post-fire vegetation cover
   increased very slowly during the initial post-fire years, and
   differences between burned and unburned areas persisted six years after
   the wildfire. Most studies on post-fire hydrology and erosion have
   identified the first one or two post-fire years as the critical period
   for high runoff and erosion risk, indicating short-term ecosystem
   resilience to wildfire. However, we found that wildfire impact on
   catchment runoff and sediment yield in Mediterranean drylands may be
   amplified by drought periods that delay plant recovery, and thus
   wildfire impacts may be still of great importance several years after

Abstract = {{Aims Tropical tree lines are often associated with abrupt shifts in
   vegetation, soils and disturbance regimes, but the underlying mechanisms
   are poorly understood. We analysed the role of grazing, fuels and fire
   in maintaining a sharp tree line with flammable heathland above
   non-flammable forest. Location Bale Mountains, Ethiopia. Methods The
   study used grazing exclosures, repeated vegetation sampling, soil
   analyses and burning and sowing experiments along an altitudinal
   gradient withHagenia abyssinicaforest,Erica trimeraforest
   andEricaheathland; all were heavily grazed, the Erica heathland also
   burnt on short rotation. Results Contrary to expectation, livestock
   exclusion did not increase flammability in the forest, but instead
   resulted in a dense carpet of non-flammable herbs. In the heathland,
   livestock exclusion led to somewhat faster post-fire fuel recovery, but
   no major change in vegetation. Seeding of tree species resulted in some
   seedling establishment, but notablyHageniagrew poorly in the heathland,
   even when protected from livestock. A bioassay, as well as observations
   of outpost trees on atypical soil above the tree line, suggests that
   this poor growth is caused by the acidic soils, rather than harsh
   climate. Despite frequent fires, heathland soils had lower pH and higher
   organic matter content than forest soils. Below the tree line, tree
   seedling establishment was successful only in forest gaps, and if
   livestock was excluded. In both forest and heathland rapid vegetative
   regeneration in the ground flora after disturbance restricted major

   fire potential between heathland and forest, and thus the sharp tree
   line would be maintained, or possibly even accentuated, in the absence

Abstract = {{Fire is a frequent disturbance in the tropical dry forests of Central
   America, yet very little is known about how native species respond to
   such events. We conducted an experimental burn in a tropical dry forest
   of western Nicaragua to evaluate plant responses to fire with respect to
   survivorship and recruitment. Measurements of woody vegetation of all
   size classes were carried out prior to the prescribed burn and three
   successive years post fire. We selected the 15 most abundant species <
   10 cm DBH to assess percent survivorship and sprouting responses post
   fire. Changes in seedling densities for these 15 most abundant species
   and the 15 least abundant species were analyzed using a repeated measure
   ANOVA. We also assessed changes in seedling densities for three species
   of international conservation concern. We found three major fire-coping
   strategies among common dry forests plants: resisters (low fire-induced
   mortality), resprouters (vigorous sprouting), and recruiters (increased
   seeding post-fire). While survivorship was generally high relative to
   tropical moist forest species, those species with lower survivorship
   used either seeding or sprouting as an alternative strategy for
   persisting in the forest community. Seed dispersal mechanisms,
   particularly wind dispersal, appear to be an important factor in
   recruitment success post-fire. Burn treatment led to a significant
   increase in the density of seedlings for two species of conservation

   data were collected at eight sites of past natural wildfire events.
   These sites represented different topographical situations, with four
   sites on slopes (lacking surface permafrost) and four sites in valleys
   (with surface permafrost). Three plots were established on each site,
   representing three different fire presence zones (burned, ecotone and

   multidimensional scaling (NMS) to describe post-fire vegetation recovery
   at different sites and multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) to

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Remnant trees or artificial perches in burned areas can favor passive
   restoration through the perch effect. Birds consuming fruits in remnant
   vegetation patches or unburned adjacent communities are expected to
   defecate or regurgitate seeds as they perch on standing burned trees and
   shrubs in post-fire areas. The purpose of this study was to determine
   whether standing burned trees and shrubs are used by frugivorous birds
   as perching structures and if their maintenance promotes passive
   restoration of burned ecosystems. We: (a) recorded the seed rain of
   woody species in microsites underneath perches and in the open, (b)
   recorded seedling survival underneath the canopy of resprouting
   individuals and in the open, and (c) quantified seed rain and seedling
   recruitment of endozoochorous species at hectare level. Standing burned
   trees and shrubs were used as natural perches by frugivorous birds and
   increased seed arrival into recently burned communities. In addition,
   seedling survival was greater below the canopy of resprouting woody
   vegetation than in the open. Thus, standing burned trees and shrubs
   provide an important structural component attracting frugivorous birds,
   and therefore seeds during early post-fire regeneration. Resprouting
   trees and shrubs were also critical during post-fire recovery, because
   they act as seed traps, facilitate seedling survival and produce fruits
   that attract frugivorous birds, promoting seed flow among different
   communities at a landscape level. Therefore, the maintenance of standing
   burned woody vegetation could favor passive restoration of burned areas.

Abstract = {{Boreal forests in western North America are considered to be resilient
   to wildfire disturbance, demonstrated by paleoecological evidence and
   adaptive regenerative traits possessed by many species. However, little
   is known about drivers of fine-scale temporal changes in understory
   communities in boreal forests immediately following fire. Knowledge of
   these changes, and their relationships with burn severity and pre-fire
   forest stand conditions, could help us determine recovery of forests as
   wildlife habitat. Such information is urgently needed in the face of
   climate warming-induced changes in fire frequency and severity. We used
   a high-quality, long-term dataset of annual measurements of understory
   vascular plant communities in sub-arctic boreal forest stands dominated
   by jack pine (Pinus banksiana), black spruce (Picea mariana), or a mix
   of the two in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Here, we describe the
   initial 10 years of annual post-fire understory plant community dynamics
   and assess the important drivers shaping understory composition during
   this critical period of post-disturbance community assembly. First, we
   determined the relative importance of burn severity, pre-fire forest
   type, bare ground, woody debris, and number of years post-fire on
   understory species richness and composition dynamics following fire.
   Second, we explored annual dynamics in these communities and determined
   if compositional change was directional and predictable over time. We
   found that pre-fire forest type, burn severity, bare ground, woody
   debris, and number of years post-fire were important predictors of
   post-fire species richness and composition. Pre-fire forest type
   explained the greatest variation in understory plant composition,
   followed by burn severity. Across forest types, most species established
   within 1-3 years following fire and initial species composition
   determined directional changes in composition. Our results suggest that
   targeting monitoring efforts in the years immediately post-fire may be
   sufficient to understand forest successional direction with respect to
   composition and the important drivers of those changes over the first
   decade post-fire. However, the recent and ongoing impacts of climate
   change in boreal regions of western North America leads to uncertainty
   surrounding the continued ability of these forests to demonstrate
   resilience under an altered fire regime so these interactions should
   continue to be considered across a range of forest types and burn
   severities. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

   burn), combined with infrequent fires (< 2 fires in 12 year period)
   appeared to promote a dense mid-storey with the opposite conditions (< 4
   years since last burn; > 2 fires in 12 year period) promoting more-open
   woodlands. Consideration of these combined fire regime attributes will
   allow fire managers to plan for a particular range of fire-mediated
   patches to maintain the desired diversity of vegetation structures.}},

Abstract = {{Using black spruce (Picea mariana)-Kalmia angustifolia dominated
   communities of eastern Canada we tested the hypothesis that habitat
   filter pre-empts biotic filter as a community structuring force in early
   post-fire succession leading to Kalmia dominated heath. We considered
   post-fire seedbed as an abiotic (habitat) filter and post-fire
   aboveground biomass of dominant plants as a biotic filter. First we
   surveyed and categorized post-fire seedbed types and tested the seedbed
   filter by a black spruce seeding experiment in 155 small plots (30 x 30
   cm(2)) on nine sites burned between 1 and 38 years previously. We then
   quantified black spruce seedling establishment in a competition removal
   and nitrogen addition experiment in twenty four 3 x 3 m(2) plots on four
   sites burned 7, 24, 23 and 29 years previously. We also conducted a
   vegetation survey in 200 plots (1 x 1 m(2)) on 20 sites along a 1- to
   76-year post-fire chronosequence. Only about 10\% post-fire seedbed with
   little or no residual organic matter was suitable for black spruce
   regeneration. On the rest of the seedbeds made up of charred humus and
   lichen substrates Kalmia grew profusely by sprouting from sub-surface
   fire survived components. Removal of aboveground competition and
   addition of nitrogen did not help black spruce seedling establishment.
   Kalmia dominated the chronosequence with 50-90\% cover until 60 years
   after fire. Black spruce cover was insignificant during the first 20
   years followed by a slow increase surpassing Kalmia cover around 60
   years. Herbaceous cover was initially high followed by a decline
   coinciding with high Kalmia cover and then increased again with
   decreased Kalmia cover. Lichen cover followed a similar trend. We
   interpret this post-fire vegetation assembly as a seedbed controlled
   phenomenon where seedbed limitation filters out the pre-fire dominant,
   black spruce, in favour of vegetatively regenerating Kalmia turning
   coniferous forest into Kalmia heath during the first four decades of
   secondary succession. (C) 2010 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by

Abstract = {{Early stages of post-fire regeneration are sensitive to various factors,
   and can provide critical information for understanding forest responses
   to fire disturbance and projecting subsequent forest dynamics. Yunnan
   pine forests are the most widespread conifer forest type in Southwest
   China, and are frequently threatened by fire disturbance. Post-fire
   regeneration of this forest type, however, has not been previously
   studied. In this study, we investigated the early post-fire regeneration
   in mixed Yunnan pine forests five months after a severe burn in 2013 on
   Mt. Qinglongling, Yunnan Province, China. We found very active post-fire
   regeneration in the burned area likely facilitated by ample summer
   rainfall, with an average regeneration density of similar to 10(5) stems
   ha(-1). Species composition of the post-fire regeneration was highly
   similar to the pre-fire community-the similarity between the pre- and
   post-fire communities was 0.530 +/- 0.222. Elevation, pre-fire community
   type, and slope position were the three primary factors in the
   variations in regeneration density and species composition, while the
   impact of fire severity was low. The regeneration density of Pinus
   species and evergreen broadleaf species showed contrasting patterns
   across the environmental gradients, and the results implied that Yunnan
   forests are generally resilient to fire disturbance. The controlling
   impacts of the pre-fire community on post-fire regeneration are driven
   by the efficient regenerating strategies of dominant species, and are a
   comprehensive reflection of habitat conditions, which are primarily
   mediated by topographic features. Species regeneration strategies and
   the high resilience of the community to fire disturbance should be taken
   into account in fire prevention and management approaches for this
   forest type. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cheatgrass, a non-native annual grass, dominates millions of hectares in
   semiarid ecosystems of the Inter-mountain West (USA). Post-fire
   invasions can reduce native species diversity and alter ecological
   processes. To curb cheatgrass invasion, land managers often seed
   recently burned areas with perennial competitor species. We sampled
   vegetation within burned (1-9 years post-fire) and nearby unburned
   (representing pre-fire) pinon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus
   osteosperma) woodland and sagebrush (Artemisia sp.) in western Colorado
   to analyze variables that might explain cheatgrass cover after fire. A
   multiple regression model suggests higher cheatgrass cover after fire
   with: (1) sagebrush v. pinon-juniper; (2) higher pre-fire cover of
   annual forbs; (3) increased time since fire; (4) lower pre-fire cover of
   biological soil crust; and (5) lower precipitation the year before fire.
   Time since fire, which coincided with higher precipitation, accounts for
   most of the variability in cheatgrass cover. No significant difference
   was found in mean cheatgrass cover between seeded and unseeded plots
   over time. However, negative relationships with pre-fire biological soil
   crust cover and native species richness suggest livestock-degraded areas
   are more susceptible to post-fire invasion. Proactive strategies for
   combating cheatgrass should include finding effective native competitors
   and restoring livestock-degraded areas.}},

Abstract = {{The temperate deciduous species Nothofagus glauca (Phil.) Krasser
   exhibits characteristics commonly found in fire-adapted vegetation, yet
   the role of fire in the evolutionary history of the vegetation in

   effects of a wildfire on early succession in a Nothofagus glauca forest
   in the Coastal Cordillera of south-central Chile by comparing data from
   a burned forest to the vegetation in an adjacent, unburned stand.
   Results from this study suggest that species present on the site at the
   time of disturbance and species subsequently dispersed onto the site
   play an important role in early post-fire succession in this ecosystem.
   In both the first and second growing seasons following fire, 77\% of the
   species found in the burned plots were also present in the unburned
   forest. Invasive species, particularly exotic invaders, were also
   important in early post-fire succession. All of the species found in the
   unburned forest were native to Chile, and 69\% represented endemic taxa.
   In contrast, 28 species were present on the burned plots that were
   absent from the unburned forest and many of these invasive species
   (43\%) were exotic taxa. Pinus radiata D. Don was particularly
   successful in invading these disturbed forests.
   The importance of persistent native species indicates that the majority
   of the plants associated with this forest type exhibit adaptations to
   survive fire. However, the presence and success of exotic invaders,
   particularly Pinus radiata, is disturbing in light of the unique and
   highly fragmented vegetation endemic to the area. Future research is

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{713-723}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary and paleoecological studies Suggest that fires are natural
   in the Mediterranean basin. However, the important increase in the
   number of fires and area burned during the 20th century has created the
   perception that fires are disasters. In the present paper, we review to
   what extent fires are generating ecological disasters in the
   Mediterranean basin, in view of current fire regimes and the long-term
   human pressure on the landscapes. Specifically, we review studies on
   post-fire plant regeneration and soil losses. The review suggests that
   although many Mediterranean ecosystems are highly resilient to fire
   (shrublands and oak forest), some are fire-sensitive (e.g. pine
   woodlands). Observed erosion rates are, in some cases, relatively high,
   especially in high fire severity conditions. The sensitive ecosystems
   (in the sense of showing strong post-fire vegetation changes and soil
   losses) are mostly of human origin (e.g. extensive pine plantations in
   old fields). Thus, although many Mediterranean basin plants have traits
   to cope with fire, a large number of the ecosystems currently found in
   this region are strongly altered, and may suffer disasters. Post-fire
   disasters are not the rule, but they may be important tinder conditions
   of previous human disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsDo functional traits explain individual tree species' responses
   to environmental filters and dispersal limitations following
   stand-replacing fire? Can post-fire conditions initiate alternate
   trajectories of community assembly?
   LocationGlacier National Park, Montana, USA.
   MethodsWe characterized the species composition of tree re-establishment
   following nine recent fires in the lower subalpine zone of Glacier
   National Park, a region with multiple co-dominant tree species that has
   experienced extensive fire in recent decades. We used GLMMs to describe
   individual species' responses to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of
   post-fire conditions and seed availability, and used multivariate
   approaches to examine whether post-fire conditions can initiate
   alternate trajectories of forest community assembly.
   ResultsPost-fire regeneration responses were strongly species-dependent
   and consistent with functional trait differences. We found that there
   was a brief opportunity for establishment during the first several years
   after fire, during which tree recruitment for all species was contingent
   upon the availability of nearby seeds and the occurrence of favourable
   weather conditions. There was a remarkable amount of compositional
   change following fire, and the majority of our study sites transitioned
   from a mixed forest to a tree assemblage dominated by a single species.
   ConclusionsDifferential species-specific responses to climate and
   disturbance can initiate alternate trajectories of community assembly,
   triggering substantial changes in forest composition. The composition of
   post-fire tree assemblages reflects the differential responses of
   individual species to climate and disturbance, providing support for the
   interacting role of dispersal and environmental filtering in shaping
   post-disturbance communities and highlighting the importance of
   incorporating functional traits into predictive models of ecosystem
   dynamics.}},

Volume = {{473}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Qualitative measures of resprouting capacity often fail to capture
   inter- and intra-species variation, whereas available quantitative
   methods can be complex and time-consuming, hindering broad-scale
   comparative studies. Here, we propose two quantitative indices that can
   be applied in a standard way in different regions. We sampled 1046
   plants of 20 dominant species (6 shrubs, 7 trees and 7 tree/shrubs) from
   the seasonally dry forests of the arid Chaco, central-western Argentina.
   Sampling was conducted in burned field sites one growing season after
   fire. For each sampled plant we measured the diameter of the main burned
   trunk (MTD) and main resprout (MRD), and the number of burned trunks
   (TN) and resprouts (RN); we then built estimated composite diameters for
   trunks and resprouts (ECTD and ECRD) and we calculated two alternative
   Resprouting Capacity Indices: RCI 1 (ECRD/ECTD); and RCI 2 (MRD/MTD).
   The indices were validated against a measure of Resprouting Vigour (RV)
   that included detailed measurement of all trunks and resprouts for a
   subset of sampled plants. In all cases, variables indicative of fire
   severity were measured and included in the analyses. The RCIs and RV
   were highly related, both at the species and growth form levels. Fire
   severity had no significant effect on these relationships, but growth
   form affected RCI 2. All species were capable of resprouting, showing
   considerable inter-species variation for the two proposed RCIs. Species
   rank differed considerably between RCIs and survival-only estimations.
   RCI 1 was higher in tree/shrubs (i.e. species regarded as trees or
   shrubs) and trees than in shrubs. All species showed decreasing
   resprouting capacity with increasing ECTD. Our results support the use
   of the proposed RCIs as a robust tool to assess resprouting capacity,
   providing more details than survival-based assessments. Choosing one or
   the other implies a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity, and may
   depend on the scale and objective of the study, and resprouting patterns
   of studied species. Species, growth form and individual plant size are
   relevant in explaining post-fire resprouting capacity and survival.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to cause widespread shifts in the
   distribution and abundance of plant species through direct impacts on
   mortality, regeneration, and survival. At landscape scales, climate
   impacts will be strongly mediated by disturbances, such as wildfire,
   which catalyze shifts in species distributions through widespread
   mortality and by shaping the post-disturbance environment. We examined
   the potential for regional shifts in low-elevation tree species in
   response to wildfire and climate warming in low-elevation, dry
   mixed-conifer forests of the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. We analyzed
   interactions among climate and wildfire on post-fire tree seedling
   regeneration 5-13 yr post-fire at 177 sites burned in 21 large wildfires
   during two years with widespread regional burning. We used generalized
   additive mixed models to quantify how the density of Douglas-fir and
   ponderosa pine seedlings varied as a function of climate normals (30-yr
   mean temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration)
   and fire (tree survivorship, burn severity, and seed source
   availability). Mean summer temperature was the most important predictor
   of post-fire seedling densities for both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir.
   Seed availability was also important in determining Douglas-fir
   regeneration. As mean summer temperature continues to increase, however,
   seed availability will become less important for determining post-fire
   regeneration. Above a mean summer temperature of 17 degrees C,
   Douglas-fir regeneration is predicted to be minimal regardless of how
   close a seed source is to a site. The majority (82\%) of our sampled
   sites are predicted to exceed a mean summer temperature of 17 degrees C
   by mid-century, suggesting significant declines in seedling densities
   and potential forest loss. Our results highlight mechanisms linking
   climate change to shifts in the distribution of two widely dominant tree
   species in western North America. Under a warming climate, we expect
   post-fire tree regeneration in these low-elevation forests to become
   increasingly unsuccessful. Such widespread regeneration failures would
   have important implications for ecosystem processes and forest
   resilience, particularly as wildfires increase in response to climate
   warming.}},

   Aim: To relate fire years and river level anomalies to the Tropical

   post-fire succession rate.
   Methods: We analysed the relationship between the SOI and water levels
   for 1968-2010. In Landsat images of the 1990s we determined fire scar
   ages. Using QuickBird images, we measured forest cover loss in 36 of
   these scars, covering 873 ha. This was validated by field measurements
   of tree mortality in 15 scars. As a metric of post-fire succession, we
   compared change in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in 10 large
   floodplain fire scars and 12 terra firme slash-and-burn fallows.
   Results: SOI explained 32\% of the variation in annual low water level.
   Forest cover loss in the 36 burn scars was 88\% +/- 8\% (mean +/- SD),
   range 67-98\%. Post-fire tree mortality was 91\%, +/- 8\%, range
   75-100\%. Correlation between cover loss and mortality was 73\% (P <

   were still present 13 years after the fires, indicating a successional
   stage similar to the first year in terra firme sites.

Abstract = {{The reintroduction of pre-European fire regimes has allowed the entry of

   we studied the invasion of Paulownia tomentosa (princess tree, an
   early-successional species introduced from Asia) across three burns in
   the southern Appalachian Mountains. Based upon classification tree
   analysis, the presence/absence of P. tomentosa 2 years after burning was
   most strongly related to the cover of residual vegetation, topographic
   shading, and moisture availability. Spatial application of
   classification tree models to repeated survey data showed that P.
   tomentosa established across a wide range of microsites 2 years after
   burning. However, predicted habitat for P. tomentosa decreased by 63\% 4
   years after fire and by 73\% 6 years after fire. Following its initial
   widespread establishment, P. tomentosa only persisted on xeric and
   exposed topographic positions that experienced high intensity burning.
   However, the sites where it persisted include rare community types that
   contain two endangered plant species that depend upon fire for

Abstract = {{Runoff and erosion rates are known to increase substantially after a
   major forest fire. Erosion control measures therefore need to be put
   into place quickly after a large fire, and determining where to locate
   the measures requires accurate mapping of post fire erosion risk. Burn
   severity can be determined from field observations, but these are costly
   and time consuming. Satellite imagery is an alternative to quickly map
   burn severity for erosion mapping purposes. Post fire erosion decreases
   as forest vegetation recovers and this is related to both pre fire
   vegetation characteristics and soil properties. The objectives of this
   study were to test the use of SPOT multispectral images for mapping burn
   severity, pre fire vegetation density, and longer term (2.5 years)
   vegetation recovery. Indices tested include the Normalized Burn Ratio
   (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Differenced
   Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), and Differenced Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (dNDVI). Indices were compared to field data gathered
   immediately after the fire and about 2.5 years later. The multi-temporal
   indices (dNBR and dNDVI) were more useful for burn severity mapping in
   the heterogeneous forest-scrubland-vineyard environment where bedrock
   and vineyard surfaces were confused with burned areas when using single
   images (NBR and NDVI). All of the post fire indices showed traces of the
   fire 2.5 years later; this was confirmed using Analysis of Variance
   where differences in indices were related to original ground cover (pine
   forest, mixed forest, mostly bedrock and vineyards) and the burn scar.
   Pre fire vegetation cover was less successfully mapped using the NDVI
   according to the initial field observations. Similarly, none of the post
   fire indices were able to distinguish differences in N-S vegetation

Title = {{Effect of Herbaceous Layer Interference on the Post-Fire Regeneration of
   a Serotinous Pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) across Two Seedling Ages}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Herbaceous vegetation is a major source of interference with the
   regeneration of woody species. This is particularly the case after
   forest fires, as a dense herbaceous layer usually regenerates naturally.
   Although the competitive effect of the herbaceous vegetation upon tree
   seedlings has been widely studied, there are still gaps in knowledge for
   management related to the effect of tree seedling age and size on the
   outcome of the interaction. In this study, we seek to determine the
   response of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) seedlings to herbaceous
   competition at two different seedling ages. For that, two treatments of
   herbaceous competition were implemented, namely unweeded (no action
   around pine seedlings) and weeded (herbaceous cover removed around pine
   seedlings). Treatments were conducted twice (2 and 4 years after the
   fire), and we monitored seedling survival and growth at the end of each
   growing season. The treatments were implemented across three adjacent
   landscape units that differed in the management of burned wood and that
   are representative of common post-fire scenarios: no intervention,
   salvage logging, and an intermediate degree of intervention. Weeding
   increased seedling survival from 44.7\% to 67.8\% when seedlings were 2
   years old, but had no effect for four-year-old seedlings, which showed
   99\% survival. Seedling growth also increased in the weeding treatment,
   but only slightly. Moreover, growth (and survival for two-year-old
   seedlings) was strongly correlated with initial seedling size,
   particularly in the case of two-year-old seedlings. Initial pine
   seedling height was strongly and positively correlated with the height
   of the herbaceous layer, supporting the existence of microsite features
   that promote plant growth above competitive effects. The results support
   that management actions conducive to foster post-fire pine forest
   restoration in this Mediterranean ecosystem should reduce herbaceous
   competition at early stages after fire (second or third year) and focus
   on larger seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{Regeneration mechanisms of vegetation and the role of tree bark
   resistance to frequent fire were studied in savanna woodlands and
   grasslands in Gambella, Western Ethiopia. Data were collected from four
   sites, each with three replicate plots. The variation between sites in
   species composition and biomass correlated with the differences in fire
   intensity, Foliar cover was recorded for individual plant species
   regenerating by sprouting from older parts of plants that had survived
   fire or by seedlings; records were made during the dry season and at the
   beginning of the wet season. Data on bark thickness and tree diameters
   of 12 dominant tree species were also recorded. Both facultative and
   obligate sprouters significantly contributed to post-fire recovery,
   comprising 98.5 \% of total vegetation cover. The contribution of
   seedlings to cover and abundance immediately following fire was
   negligible, but seedling density increased in the beginning of the rainy
   season, 4 to 5 months after fire. The importance of the sprouting and
   seeding strategies varied between the different plant growth forms. The
   highest contribution to cover and frequency was made by the most
   abundant grass species, which reproduced in both ways. Facultative
   sprouters made up 67.3 \% of the vegetation cover, out of which 54 \%
   consisted of grasses. Broad-leaved herbs and trees/shrubs regenerating
   mainly by sprouting made up 31.3 \% of the vegetation cover. Adaptations
   to fire in tree species seemed to in clude the development of a thick
   bark, once the tree has passed seedling stages. Tree bark thickness and
   tree diameter at breast height were strongly correlated with the time
   taken for cambium to reach an assumed lethal temperature of 60degreesC
   when exposed to fire, which indicated that mature trees with thick barks
   might resist stronger fire better than, e.g., small or young trees and
   trees with thin bark. However, for a given bark thickness the cambium
   resistance to heat varied three-fold among species. Hence, site
   differences in fire intensity seemed to influence the distribution of
   trees depending on their bark characteristics and resistance to fire.}},

   following wildfire}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{338}},
Pages = {{84-91}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Severe wildfires create pulses of dead trees that influence future fuel
   loads, fire behavior, and fire effects as they decay and deposit surface
   woody fuels. Harvesting fire-killed trees may reduce future surface
   woody fuels and related fire hazards, but the magnitude and timing of
   post-fire logging effects on woody fuels have not been fully assessed.
   To address this issue, we sampled surface woody fuels within 255
   coniferous forest stands that burned with high fire severity in 68
   wildfires between 1970 and 2007 in eastern Washington and Oregon, USA.
   Sampling included 96 stands that were logged after wildfire and 159
   stands that were not logged. Most forest stands sampled were dominated
   by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii) prior to wildfire and historically supported low and
   mixed-severity fire regimes. In unlogged stands, woody fuel loads were
   low initially, but then increased and peaked 10-20 years following
   wildfire. In logged stands, small and medium diameter woody fuel loads
   peaked immediately after logging, whereas large diameter woody fuel
   loads peaked 10-20 years after wildfire. Relative to unlogged stands,
   post-fire logging initially increased surface woody fuel loads,
   increasing small diameter fuel loads by up to 2.1 Mg/ha during the first
   5 years after fire and increasing medium diameter fuel loads by up to
   5.8 Mg/ha during the first 7 years after fire. Logging subsequently
   reduced surface woody fuel loads, reducing large diameter fuel loads by
   up to 53 Mg/ha between 6 and 39 years after wildfire, reducing medium
   diameter fuel loads by up to 2.4 Mg/ha between 12 and 23 years after
   wildfire, and reducing small diameter fuel loads by up to 1.4 Mg/ha
   between 10 and 28 years after wildfire. Logging also reduced rotten,
   large diameter fuel loads by up to 24 Mg/ha between 20 and 39 years
   after wildfire. Our study suggests that post-fire logging can
   significantly reduce future surface woody fuel levels in forests
   regenerating following wildfires. The magnitude of woody fuel reduction
   depends, however, on the volume and sizes of wood removed, logging
   methods, post-logging fuel treatments, and the amount of coarse woody
   debris left on-site to support wildlife habitat, erosion control, and
   other competing management objectives. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-driven increases in disturbance frequency and extent augment the

   (2) How do post-fire relationships between ground cover and conifer
   regeneration vary with recent disturbance history? We measured ground
   cover and conifer regeneration from 2003 to 2014 following
   stand-replacing fires in 2002. Burned stands were either blown down in
   1997, affected by a 1940s Dendroctonus rufipennis (spruce beetle; SB)
   outbreak, or neither. Implementing mixed-effects models, we measured the
   relationships between pre-fire stand attributes (structural stage,
   canopy dominance and combination of disturbances) and post-fire ground
   cover and between post-fire ground cover and conifer regeneration.
   Fire-only stands had more litter and herbaceous cover post fire than
   other stands (P<0.05). Fir regeneration increased with litter in stands
   that only burned, but decreased with litter in stands that were first
   blown down. Similarly, pine and fir regeneration increased with

Abstract = {{Questions Fire is a key factor influencing Araucaria araucana forests,
   but the impact of fire severity on the understorey vegetation is not
   well understood. In this study we seek to answer the following
   questions: (a) how do initial plant diversity, composition and spatial
   distribution of the understorey vegetation change in response to
   different levels of fire severity; and (b) does the abundance of
   dominant tree species exhibit different patterns across a fire severity
   gradient shortly after fire?
   Location Old-growth Araucaria araucana-Nothofagus pumilio forests in the
   Andes of south-central Chile (38 degrees S, 71 degrees W) burned in
   2015.
   Methods We evaluated the post-fire plant regeneration across a fire
   severity gradient ranging from unburned forests to areas of high fire
   severity. One year after fire (in February 2016), we measured woody and
   herbaceous species richness, abundance, height, origin (native vs exotic
   species), life forms and the spatial pattern of plant recovery.
   Results Plant species richness and abundance were significantly higher
   within the unburned forest and low fire severity areas one year after
   fire, compared to areas of high and moderate fire severity. Overall,
   nearly 50\% of the species present in the unburned forest were not found
   in areas of high severity, including the tree Nothofagus pumilio. Rapid
   vegetative resprouting of pioneer species such as Chusquea culeou
   resulted in an aggregated spatial distribution of plants after fire.
   Conclusions Plant diversity and the abundance of Araucaria araucana and
   Nothofagus pumilio were reduced in areas of high fire severity one year
   after fire. Exotic species were more abundant within areas of low
   severity, being likely mediated by cattle browsing. Our research makes
   clear the potential changes in forest composition and structure if
   dominant tree species are not capable of recovering after fire. We
   recommend the exclusion of cattle within fire-affected areas and
   planting Nothofagus pumilio in areas of high fire severity.}},

Abstract = {{Following a forest fire (27 500 ha) in 1994, post-fire recolonization of

   reestablishment of lichens, and modes of dispersal. Three sites in the
   Chiricahua Mountains (Arizona, USA) were chosen according to the
   severity of fire damage-unburned, moderately burned, and severely
   burned. From 1994 through 1997, the amount of dead lichen cover
   significantly increased at the moderately burned site. For the same time
   period, the amount of live lichen cover significantly increased at the

   the severely burned site each year but only in the last year (1996-1997)
   for the moderately burned site. Bark texture and proximity to trees with
   lichens were among the most important physical factors for
   recolonization. The most important means of dispersal for Flavopunctelia
   praesignis was fragmentation. For Punctelia hypoleucites, the primary

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Context After fire, immigration from outside burnt areas is important
   for the recovery of faunal communities. However, for recovery to occur,
   the matrix around the fire must support source populations of
   immigrants. Therefore, the landscape context of fires may be a critical
   determinant of the species pool available for (re)colonisation, hence
   post-fire community composition. Increasingly, fires occur in fragmented
   systems, and there is limited knowledge of how the surrounding landscape
   interacts with post-fire community recovery.
   Aim The present study aimed to examine how landscape context influences
   faunal communities after large wildfires.
   Methods Three reserves burnt by wildfire were examined 18 months before
   the study in the Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. In all cases
   the burnt area consisted of natural mallee woodland. Two fires occurred
   within a matrix of extensive natural vegetation, while the third fire
   burnt >80\% of a reserve situated within a highly fragmented, largely
   agricultural landscape. Birds, reptiles and mammals were surveyed at 90
   sites inside and outside the fire boundaries, and relationships of
   species occurrence to reserve location, burnt versus unburnt status and
   distance from fire edge were all examined.
   Key results Post-fire faunal communities reflected the species in the
   surrounding unburnt landscape. Notably, open habitat specialists,
   invasive species and species that can persist in small habitat patches
   were prominent within the fragmented system. Post-fire fauna communities
   were also influenced by variation of the natural vegetation surrounding
   the fire. The occurrence of species with low dispersal ability (i.e.
   reptiles) was influenced by local (patch scale) vegetation structure.
   2Conclusions The landscape context of fires is a major driver of the
   composition of post-fire faunal communities. Our results highlight the
   potential loss of species sensitive to fragmentation from fire-prone
   natural vegetation within modified landscapes, and that a reduced pool
   of potential immigrants leads to attenuated succession', compromising
   recovery of the pre-fire community.
   Implications Post-fire colonists reflect the surrounding landscapes
   species pool, such that reserves surrounded by fragmented or otherwise
   low quality habitat are at risk of attenuated succession after fire.
   Landscape context should be incorporated into conservation planning in
   fire-prone ecosystems, including consideration of surrounding habitat
   quality and connectivity and protecting long unburnt vegetation.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{Accumulation of dead woody material is a critical management concern
   following wildfires, especially given the possibility of subsequent
   wildfires. Forest structure and fuel accumulation are largely driven by
   site climatic conditions, so variability in site conditions is important
   to consider in management beyond the one-size fits all model for
   post-fire fuel dynamics. Moreover, dead woody material provides
   important ecological functions for forested ecosystems. Understanding
   when surface fuels biomass is highest following wildfires and how these
   dynamics change after repeated fires affords land management agencies
   opportunities to adjust fuel reduction strategies without removing large
   quantities of dead trees that are important in these post-fire
   landscapes for a variety of ecosystem services, including wildlife,
   water and nutrient retention, and soil stabilization. Here, we examined
   how surface fuels and standing dead trees change over time, by burn
   severity, site climate, and with repeated fires at seven different
   years-since-fire (1-24 years) across 182 sites from ten wildfires in
   central Idaho. Downed woody fuel loads were higher on moister and cooler
   sites. Large-diameter woody fuels saw significant increases after about
   14 years post-fire while smaller woody fuels had the highest loads at 20
   years post-fire. Surface fuel loads varied by burn severity and years
   since fires, with the highest loadings at longer years since fire and
   sites burned in stand replacing fire. Litter and duff had not
   sufficiently accumulated to compensate for continued decomposition,
   resulting in lower forest floor biomass through 24 years post fire.
   Density of snags of all sizes generally declined after 7-9 years, but
   large-diameter snags were still standing 24 years post fire. Repeated
   fires resulted in >40\% reduction in both surface fuels and standing
   trees compared to once-burned areas at the same years since fire. Burned
   landscapes can serve a great ecological benefit by providing an infusion
   of both standing and downed dead woody debris. Additionally, though some
   sites burned in stand replacing fires exceed recommended surface fuel
   loadings, these ecological considerations should be weighed against
   concerns about reburning potential and fire fighter hazards.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main factors involved in the decline in the European wild
   rabbit in the Iberian Peninsula is the loss of suitable habitats caused
   by abandonment of agricultural and grazing activities. Nowadays,
   Mediterranean landscapes suffer from wildfires that affect extensive
   areas and produce considerable habitat changes. However, little is known
   about the influence of wildfires and post-fire treatments on rabbit
   abundance to address policies to recover their populations. To do so, we
   studied abundances of this species in four types of plots during three
   consecutive years after a wildfire in Catalonia (NE Spain): (A) unburnt
   forests, (B) burnt forests with removal of burnt trees but with branches
   left, (C) burnt forests with removal of burnt trees and branches, and
   (D) non-forested burnt plots. Rabbits progressively colonised burnt
   plots, where their abundance increased for at least 5 years after the
   fire, but decreased or even disappeared in unburnt ones, indicating that
   forest fires have a positive effect on rabbit populations. Although
   abundances did not differ between the three burnt plot types, plots with
   removal of burnt branches had the highest increase in abundance. In
   addition, soil covered by branches or by dense vegetation appeared
   negatively correlated with abundance, indicating that this could hinder
   rabbit movements, while some plant species could benefit rabbits by
   providing high quality food. Thus, post-fire treatments favourable to
   rabbit populations might therefore be a good way of increasing the
   conservation and economic value of areas affected by forest fires.}},

Abstract = {{Salvage logging following fire has become increasingly used during the
   last few decades as a way to mitigate economic losses caused by fire.
   The removal of burned mature trees including their aerial seedbanks
   immediately after fire could have impacts on post-fire tree recruitment
   but specific effects are still unknown. We conducted a study of a fire
   in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, to answer the following
   questions: Does fire severity influence tree compositional changes after
   fire? Does salvage logging affect these changes by favouring species
   that can reproduce vegetatively? Does salvage logging reduce among-sites
   heterogeneity relative to natural post-fire forests? To address these
   questions, we measured pre-and post-fire tree stocking (2 years after
   fire) of burned forest of different pre-fire stand composition types
   both in salvaged and non-salvaged sites, whereas fire severity was
   measured in the latter only. Species composition was evaluated using a
   Principal Component Analysis, and mixed models were used to test the
   effects of canopy fire severity, residual organic layer thickness, stand
   type and salvage logging on pre- to post-fire composition changes. In
   non-salvaged sites, fire severity had a significant effect on
   composition changes, and the effect depended on stand type. Low fire
   severity favoured species that can reproduce vegetatively such as
   Populus tremuloides, whereas moderate and high fire severity favoured
   the aerial seedbank species such as Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana.
   We found no effect of residual organic layer thickness on post-fire
   composition changes. Salvage treatment had a significant effect on
   post-fire composition changes and the effect depended on stand type.
   Overall, salvage logging tended to favour species relying upon
   vegetative reproduction more than fire alone, which favoured P.
   banksiana. Although among-site heterogeneity after salvage logging was
   not smaller than after fire only, salvage alters species composition
   more than does natural fire alone. Since salvage logging and low
   severity portions of the burn, which are generally not salvaged, both
   favour tree species with vegetative reproduction, our results suggest
   that these species will increase their dominance throughout the
   landscape if burned forests are systematically salvaged. We suggest
   strategies that can help to attenuate this divergence from natural
   post-fire conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Post-fire salvage logging (i.e. felling and removing burnt trees, often
   eliminating the remaining woody debris) is a practice routinely
   performed by forest managers worldwide. In Mediterranean-type
   ecosystems, salvage logging is considered a measure to reduce future
   reforestation costs, but this assumption remains largely untested. We
   made a cost analysis of different management schemes, addressing the
   immediate post-fire burnt-wood management as well as the costs and
   success of subsequent reforestation efforts. Two experimental 25-ha
   plots were established in a burnt pine reforestation of SE Spain, in
   which three replicates of three post-fire treatments were applied:
   non-intervention (NI), partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and
   lopping off the branches from most of the trees, leaving all biomass in
   situ), and salvage logging (SL). After 4 years, a mechanised
   reforestation was undertaken, and seedling mortality was monitored for 2
   years. The cost of all management operations was recorded in situ, and
   the cost of re-planting the dead seedlings was estimated according to
   the expenses of previous reforestation. Initial cost of wood management
   was greatest in SL and zero in NI. Reforestation cost was highest in NI
   and lowest in SL, and seedling-mortality rates proved lowest in PCL (43
   \% vs. 51 \% and 52 \% in SL and NI, respectively). Considering all the
   post-fire management operations, salvage logging did not provide
   particular economic advantages for forest restoration, and had an
   overall cost of 3,436 +/- A 340 a,not sign/ha. By contrast, NI and PCL
   reduced total restoration costs by 50 and 35 \%, respectively, and PCL
   indeed promoted restoration success. We suggest that the full cost of
   management operations needs to be considered when evaluating the
   economic implications of post-fire salvage logging.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the canopy seed bank structure of Pinus halepensis, we
   measured the level of serotiny and the seed bank size and density of
   trees in unburned stands and post-fire regenerated stands in Israel. We
   analysed the effects of tree size, tree density and fire history on the
   level of serotiny. The level of serotiny decreased with an increase in
   tree height. The high level of serotiny in short trees could be
   explained by selection to increase regeneration chances after burning at
   pre-mature age. Also, limitation of long-distance seed dispersal
   opportunities in short trees may favour high serotiny levels. The level
   of serotiny was higher in post-fire stands than in unburned stands,
   suggesting a fast selection for serotiny by fire. Unburned stands had a
   higher total stand seed density than post-fire regenerated stands, but
   the proportion of seeds in serotinous cones of the total stand seed
   density was higher in post-fire regenerated stands. The fact that P.
   halepensis bears simultaneously serotinous and non-serotinous cones
   reflects its dual strategy as both a post-fire obligate seeder, mainly
   from serotinous cones and an early coloniser during fire-free periods,
   mainly from non-serotinous cones. The relative investment in these
   strategies is dependent on fire history and varies with tree height.
   Furthermore, mature brown cones can contribute to post-fire regeneration
   in case of spring fires, and serotinous cones are known to open
   partially also in dry spell events. Thus, post-fire regeneration and
   invasion are strategies, which seem to complement each other.}},

   post-fire competing vegetation. In stands which had been deciduous
   (Populus sp.)-dominated, conifer (white spruce)-dominated, or mixed
   pre-fire we measured regeneration stocking (presence in 10 m(2) plots),
   density and height 10-20 years post-burn in five wildfires in Alberta,
   Canada. Most plots regenerated to the deciduous or mixed stocking types;
   plots in the older fire and in stands that were pure conifer pre-fire
   had higher amounts of conifer regeneration. Surprisingly, regeneration
   in pre-fire `pure' white spruce stands was most often to pine, although
   these had not been recorded in the pre-fire inventory. Pre-fire
   deciduous stands were the most resilient in that poplar species
   dominated their post-fire regeneration in terms of stocking, density and
   height. These stands also had the highest diversity of regenerating tree
   species and the most unstocked plots. High grass cover negatively
   affected regeneration density of both deciduous and conifer trees. Our
   results demonstrate the natural occurrence of regeneration gaps, pre- to
   post-fire changes in forest composition, and high variation in post-fire
   regeneration composition. These should be taken into consideration when

Abstract = {{Clearcutting practices combined with the predicted increase in fire
   activity may induce post-fire regeneration failure in boreal forest
   landscapes. This study aims (1) to evaluate if recently managed
   landscape by clear cut logging is susceptible to be affected by
   post-fire regeneration failure; and (2) to explore the ecological
   drivers of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) post-fire
   regeneration. In 2014, we surveyed the regeneration of 36 stands in
   northwestern Quebec that had burned in a major fire in 2005. Fire
   severity was evaluated for each site with the differenced Normalized
   Burn Ratio. Using linear models, we explored the relationship between
   environmental variables (fire severity, pre-fire stand maturity, nature
   of the seedbed, and physiographic variables) and black spruce post-fire
   regeneration. Black spruce post fire seedling density was highly
   variable (range: 25-16 000 seedlings/ha; mean +/- standard deviation:
   4549 seedlings/ha +/- 4752) within the studied fire, but did not
   significantly differ between stands that had been logged 50 years prior
   to fire and those that were mature prior to the 2005 fire. However,
   post-fire regeneration failure (defined as <40\% stocking that
   corresponds in our study region to a regeneration density <1750
   seedlings/ha) was observed in 48\% of the stands that had been logged,
   but only in 29\% of the stands that were mature prior to the fire. The
   presence of residual trees left after clearcutting may explain why
   regeneration level was relatively good (>50\%) in stands affected by
   past logging activities. Our study illustrates how biological legacies,
   environmental conditions and fire severity determine post-fire recovery
   and resilience of black spruce-dominated ecosystems of eastern Canada.

Abstract = {{Wildfires constitute the most important natural disturbance of
   Mediterranean forests, driving vegetation dynamics. Although
   Mediterranean species have developed ecological post-fire recovery
   strategies, the impacts of climate change and changes in fire regimes
   may endanger their resilience capacity. This study aims at assessing
   post-fire recovery dynamics at different stages in two large fires that
   occurred in Mediterranean pine forests (Spain) using temporal
   segmentation of the Landsat time series (1994-2018). Landsat-based
   detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) was used to
   derive trajectory metrics from Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW), sensitive to
   canopy moisture and structure, and Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA), related to
   vegetation cover gradients. Different groups of post-fire trajectories
   were identified through K-means clustering of the Recovery Ratios (RR)
   from fitted trajectories: continuous recovery, continuous recovery with
   slope changes, continuous recovery stabilized and non-continuous
   recovery. The influence of pre-fire conditions, fire severity,
   topographic variables and post-fire climate on recovery rates for each
   recovery category at successional stages was analyzed through
   Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The modeling results indicated
   that pine forest recovery rates were highly sensitive to post-fire
   climate in the mid and long-term and to fire severity in the short-term,
   but less influenced by topographic conditions (adjusted R-squared ranged
   from 0.58 to 0.88 and from 0.54 to 0.93 for TCA and TCW, respectively).
   Recovery estimation was assessed through orthophotos, showing a high
   accuracy (Dice Coefficient ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 and from 0.74 to
   0.96 for TCA and TCW, respectively). This study provides new insights
   into the post-fire recovery dynamics at successional stages and driving
   factors. The proposed method could be an approach to model the recovery
   for the Mediterranean areas and help managers in determining which areas
   may not be able to recover naturally.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding mechanisms underlying fire regime effects on savanna fauna
   is difficult because of a wide range of possible trophic interactions
   and feedbacks. Yet, understanding mechanisms underlying fauna dynamics
   is crucial for conservation management of threatened species. Small
   savanna mammals in northern Australia are currently undergoing
   widespread declines and regional extinctions partly attributable to fire
   regimes. This study investigates mammal trophic and ecosystem responses
   to fire in order to identify possible mechanisms underlying these
   declines. Mammal trophic responses to fire were investigated by
   surveying mammal abundance, mammal diet, vegetation structure and
   non-mammal fauna dynamics in savannas six times at eight sites over a
   period of 3 years. Known site-specific fire history was used to test for
   trophic responses to post-fire interval and fire frequency. Mammal and
   non-mammal fauna showed only minor responses of post-fire interval and
   no effect of fire frequency. Lack of fauna responses differed from large
   post-fire vegetation responses. Dietary analysis showed that two mammal
   species, Dasyurus hallucatus and Isoodon auratus, increased their intake
   of large prey groups in recently burnt, compared to longer unburnt
   vegetation. This suggests a fire-related change in trophic interactions
   among predators and their prey, after removal of ground-layer
   vegetation. No evidence was found for other changes in food resource
   uptake by mammals after fire. These data provide support for a
   fire-related top-down ecosystem response among savanna mammals, rather
   than a bottom-up resource limitation response. Future studies need to
   investigate fire responses among other predators, including introduced
   cats and dingoes, to determine their roles in fire-related mammal
   declines in savannas of northern Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How does fire severity, measured as depth of burn of ground
   layer fuels, control the regeneration of understorey species across
   black spruce-dominated stands varying in pre-fire organic layer depths?
   Are successional shifts from evergreen to deciduous understorey
   vegetation more likely to occur with greater depth of burn? Does a shift
   in understorey vegetation community towards more deciduous species
   influence carbon accumulation in vegetation biomass?
   Location: Northern boreal forest, interior Alaska.
   Methods: We sampled 32 stands in interior Alaska that burned in 2003 and
   2004 in which depth of burn had been recorded soon after fire. In 2014
   we characterized tree density, understorey vegetation composition,
   above-and below-ground vegetation carbon pools, and a suite of
   environmental variables. We used ANOVA and multivariate redundancy
   analysis models to analyse the dominant controls on vegetation
   composition and carbon pools.
   Results: Fire severity was a strong control on post-fire tree and
   non-vascular species composition. Ten years post-fire, sites that
   experienced deeper burning of organic layers had a higher abundance of
   deciduous tree species, fire-adapted mosses, forbs and graminoids, and
   lower abundances of evergreen shrubs and Sphagnum mosses. Environmental
   variables (elevation, soil bulk density and mineral soil pH, moisture
   and temperature) served as important controls on tree and vascular
   understorey species composition. We found no evidence that carbon pools
   associated with recovering vegetation biomass were influenced by
   landscape position, fire severity or environmental variables.
   Conclusions: Both fire frequency and depth of burn are projected to
   increase with a warmer climate in interior Alaska. These shifts in fire
   regime are expected to favour the regeneration of deciduous species over
   conifers, which have the potential to regulate successional pathways and
   large-scale trends in albedo, which both ultimately could influence
   ecosystem-climate feedbacks and dampen future fire cycles. Our results
   show that understorey species composition is controlled by fire
   severity, suggesting that more severe burning causes a decline in the
   self-replacement of conifer communities across a range of hydrologic
   settings. Overall, our results suggest a loss of resilience in black
   spruce forests in the face of a changing fire regime. However, we found
   no evidence that fire severity influences vegetation carbon pools 10 yrs
   post-fire, suggesting that there is less landscape variation in biomass
   carbon pools than in vegetation composition and succession during early
   post-fire succession.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In an era characterized by recurrent large wildfires in many parts of
   the globe, there is a critical need to understand how animal species
   respond to fires, the rates at which populations can recover, and the
   functional changes fires may cause. Using quantified changes in habitat
   parameters over a similar to 400-yr post-fire chronosequence in an
   obligate-seeding Australian eucalypt woodland, we build and test
   predictions of how birds, as individual species and aggregated into
   functional groups according to their use of specific habitat resources,
   respond to time since fire. Individual bird species exhibited four
   generalized response types to time since fire: incline, decline,
   delayed, and bell. All significant relationships between bird functional
   group richness or abundance and time since fire were consistent with
   predictions based on known time-since-fire-associated changes in habitat
   features putatively important for these bird groups. Consequently, we
   argue that the bird community is responding to post-fire successional
   changes in habitat as per the habitat accommodation model, rather than
   to time since fire per se, and that our functional framework will be of
   value in predicting bird responses to future disturbances in this and
   other obligate-seeder forest and woodland ecosystems. Most bird species
   and functional groups that were affected by time since fire were
   associated with long-unburned woodlands. In the context of recent large,
   stand-replacement wildfires that have affected a substantial proportion
   of obligate-seeder eucalypt woodlands, and the multi-century timescales
   over which post-fire succession occurs, it would appear preferable from
   a bird conservation perspective if fires initiating loss of currently
   long-unburned woodlands were minimized. Once long-unburned woodlands are
   transformed by fire into recently burned woodlands, there is limited
   scope for alternative management interventions to accelerate the rate of
   habitat development after fire, or supplement the resources formerly
   provided to birds by long-unburned woodlands, with the limited exception
   of augmenting hollow availability for key hollow-nesting species.}},

Abstract = {{The current study investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics of
   post-fire vegetation and the subsequent influence on seasonal and annual
   hydrologic responses in chaparral-dominated watersheds. Post-fire
   climatology, burn severity, slope aspect, and vegetation behavior are
   evaluated for two basins burned during the 2003 Old Fire in the San
   Bernardino Mountains in Southern California. Climate and discharge data
   are used to evaluate seasonal and annual variability of post-fire
   hydrologic fluxes. Data obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to estimate Enhanced Vegetation Index
   (EVI) and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). A Savitzky-Golay
   filtering technique and an integrated EVI annual fraction are utilized
   to assess vegetation recovery under a range of potential controls.
   Vegetation recovery is highly variable in both watersheds and is related
   to slope aspect (solar and water availability), initial biomass levels,
   and burn severity. South and west facing slopes show higher pre-fire EVI
   (biomass) and significant loss of vegetation cover after fire.
   Vegetation in both watersheds responds to an extreme wet season during
   the second post-fire year. however recovery rates are not sustained.
   North and east aspects show the quickest biomass gain relative to
   pre-fire conditions by the end of the study period (WY 2010), while the
   west and south slopes show lower biomass recovery. High burn severity
   areas show the slowest recovery across all slope aspects, with these
   regions just approaching 90\% of pre-fire biomass by the end of the
   seven-year post-fire period. The variable rate of vegetation recovery
   across the watersheds results in significant changes in annual and
   seasonal discharge throughout the post-fire period. Runoff ratios remain
   elevated in both systems and there is increased dry season flow for much
   of the study period, indicating that plant water consumption and
   flowpaths are not back to pre-fire behavior by the end of WY 2010. (C)

   variability in burn intensity and severity. Previous research on mammal
   response to wildfire has often considered all fires as comparable
   disturbances regardless of size. Here, we explicitly examine whether
   fire size affects relative abundances of a keystone herbivore, snowshoe
   hare (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777), in regenerating stands of the
   same age. We surveyed vegetation and fecal pellets of snowshoe hares in
   nine 13-year-old wildfires, specifically, three fires in three size
   categories-small (80 to 200 ha), medium (1000 to 5000 ha), and large
   (>10 000 ha)-and in mature forests in southern British Columbia, Canada.
   Results: Snowshoe hare density was low (0.4 hares ha(-1)), but hares
   were present at 57\% of mature sites. Hares were absent from all areas
   where small fires had burned and were found in only one medium area post
   fire (0.2 hares ha(-1)). Hares were found within the fire scars of all
   three large burned areas, and with much higher numbers (3.8 hares
   ha(-1)) than in the medium fire area or mature forest. Snowshoe hare
   abundance was highly correlated with the number of sapling trees,
   especially lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon). Sapling
   densities were highly variable, but dense stands of saplings were found
   only in burn scars from large wildfires.
   Conclusions: Fire size is an important predictor of snowshoe hare
   relative abundance in areas that are regenerating post fire; fires of
   different sizes are not comparable disturbances. Specifically, the
   post-fire heterogeneity after large fires enabled both the highest hare
   numbers as well as patches with no hares. These results suggest that
   forest and wildlife managers should protect areas with dense
   regeneration post fire, as these sites are necessary for hares after
   large wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{Anticipating how boreal forest landscapes will change in response to
   changing fire regime requires disentangling the effects of various
   spatial controls on the recovery process of tree saplings. Spatially
   explicit monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery through moderate
   resolution Landsat imagery is a popular technique but is filled with
   ambiguous information due to mixed pixel effects. On the other hand,
   very-high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery accurately measures crown
   size of tree saplings but has gained little attention and its utility
   for estimating leaf area index (LAI, m(2)/m(2)) and tree sapling
   abundance (TSA, seedlings/ha) in post-fire landscape remains untested.
   We compared the explanatory power of 30 m Landsat satellite imagery with
   0.5-m WorldView-2 VHR imagery for LAI and TSA based on field sampling
   data, and subsequently mapped the distribution of LAI and TSA based on
   the most predictive relationships. A random forest (RF) model was
   applied to assess the relative importance and causal mechanisms of
   spatial controls on tree sapling recovery. The results showed that pixel
   percentage of canopy trees (PPCT) derived from VHR imagery outperform
   all Landsat-derived spectral indices for explaining variance of LAI
   (R-VHR(2) = 0.676 vs. R-Landsat(2) = 0.427) and TSA (R-VHR(2) = 0.508
   vs. R-Landsat(2) = 0.499). The RF model explained an average of 55.5\%
   (SD = 3.0\%, MSE = 0.382, N = 50) of the variation of estimated LAI.
   Understory vegetation coverage (competition) and post-fire surviving
   mature trees (seed sources) were the most important spatial controls for
   LAI recovery, followed by burn severity (legacy effect), topographic
   factors (environmental filter) and nearest distance to unburned area
   (edge effect). These analyses allow us to conclude that in our study
   area, mitigating wildfire severity and size may increase forest
   resilience to wildfire damage. Given the easily-damaged seed banks and
   relatively short seed dispersal distance of coniferous trees, reasonable
   human help to natural recovery of coniferous forests is necessary for
   severe burns with a large patch size, particularly in certain areas. Our
   research shows the VHR WorldView-2 imagery better resolves key
   characteristics of forest landscapes like LAI and TSA than Landsat
   imagery, providing a valuable tool for land managers and researchers
   alike.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{308}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research has focused on comparing the impacts of post-fire
   salvage logging versus those of less aggressive management practices on
   forest regeneration. However, few studies have addressed the effects of
   different burnt-wood management options on seedling/sapling performance,
   or the ecophysiological mechanisms underlying differences among
   treatments. In this study, we experimentally assess the effects of
   post-fire management of the burnt wood on the growth and performance of
   naturally regenerating pine seedlings (Pinus pinaster). Three post-fire
   management treatments varying in degree of intervention were implemented
   seven months after a high-severity wildfire burned Mediterranean pine
   forests in the Sierra Nevada, southeast Spain: (a) ``No Intervention{''}
   (NI, all burnt trees left standing); (b) ``Partial Cut plus Lopping{''}
   (PCL, felling most of the burnt trees, cutting off branches, and leaving
   all the biomass on site without mastication); and (c) ``Salvage
   Logging{''} (SL, felling the burnt trees, piling up the logs and
   masticating the fine woody debris). Three years after the fire, the
   growth, foliar nutrient concentrations, and leaf carbon, nitrogen and
   oxygen isotopic composition (delta C-13, delta O-18 and delta N-15) of
   naturally regenerating seedlings were measured in all the treatments.
   Pine seedlings showed greatest vigor and size in the PCL treatment,
   whereas growth was poorest in SL. The nutrient concentrations were
   similar among treatments, although greater growth in the two treatments
   with residual wood present indicated higher plant uptake. Seedlings in
   the SL treatment showed high leaf delta C-13 and delta O-18 values
   indicating severe water stress, in contrast to significantly alleviated
   water stress indications in the PCL treatment. Seedling growth and
   physiological performance in NI was intermediate between that of PCL and
   SL After six growing seasons, P. pinaster saplings in PCL showed greater
   growth and cone production than SL saplings. In summary, salvage logging
   has a detrimental effect on the ecophysiological performance and growth
   of naturally regenerating pine seedlings, compared to alternative
   post-fire management practices in which burnt logs and branches are left
   in situ. Improved seedling growth and performance is associated with the
   amelioration of microsite/microclimate conditions by the presence of
   residual burnt wood, which alleviates seedling drought stress and
   improves nutrient availability through the decomposition of woody
   debris. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{What drives European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) mortality after forest
   fires of varying severity?}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{368}},
Pages = {{81-93}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the timing and amount of tree mortality after a forest fire
   is of paramount importance for post fire management decisions, such as
   salvage logging or reforestation. Such knowledge is particularly needed
   in mountainous regions where forest stands often serve as protection
   against natural hazards (e.g., snow avalanches, rockfalls, landslides).
   In this paper, we focus on the drivers and timing of mortality in
   fire-injured beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) in mountain regions. We
   studied beech forests in the southwestern European Alps, which burned
   between 1970 and 2012. The results show that beech trees, which lack
   fire-resistance traits, experience increased mortality within the first
   two decades post-fire with a timing and amount strongly related to the
   burn severity. Beech mortality is fast and ubiquitous in high severity
   sites, whereas small- (DBH <12 cm) and intermediate-diameter (DBH 12-36
   cm) trees face a higher risk to die in moderate-severity sites.
   Large-diameter trees mostly survive, representing a crucial ecological
   legacy for beech regeneration. Mortality remains low and at a level
   similar to unburnt beech forests for low burn severity sites. Beech
   trees diameter, the presence of fungal infestation and elevation are the
   most significant drivers of mortality. The risk of beech to die
   increases toward higher elevation and is higher for small-diameter than
   for large-diameter trees. In case of secondary fungi infestation beech
   faces generally a higher risk to die. Interestingly, fungi that initiate
   post-fire tree mortality differ from fungi occurring after mechanical
   injury. From a management point of view, the insights about the controls
   of post-fire mortality provided by this study should help in planning
   post-fire silvicultural measures in montane beech forests. (C) 2016

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{458}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Shifting fire regimes are substantially changing North American forests.
   It is thus critical to understand how wildfires affect forest wildlife,
   especially for species managed for harvest and for species at risk of
   extinction. In particular, many populations of carnivores and ungulates
   are actively managed, so being able to anticipate their responses to
   future fires, or as burned forests regenerate, would be valuable for
   management and conservation. We examine how well the current literature
   addresses these important needs. We reviewed 131 papers published from
   1970 to 2019 that reported carnivore and ungulate responses to fires in
   North American conifer forests. We evaluated the study designs, fire
   attributes, species studied, and response variables measured. This
   literature contains considerable taxonomic bias, inconsistent reporting
   of fire and landscape characteristics, and a mismatch between research
   objectives and management needs. Of the 18 carnivore species studied
   post-fire, just three (grizzly bears Ursus arctos, Canada lynx Lynx
   canadensis, and American marten Martes americana) comprised nearly half
   of the literature (47.8\%). Few papers reported the spatial extents of
   fires being studied (32.6\% for carnivores and 38.2\% for ungulates).
   Most studies focused on recent burns (< 15 years post-fire) and
   monitored post-fire responses for fewer than five years. Few papers
   measured true population responses post-fire (6.7\% for carnivores and
   12.4\% for ungulates); the majority of papers focused on animal
   movements or habitat use (presence/absence or relative activity) rather
   than estimates of survival, recruitment, or population size. Our review
   also indicates that studying fires with a more diverse array of spatial
   extents, ages, and severities would be useful for most species.}},

   Succession: The Case of Bryophyte Communities in a Macaronesian Laurel
   Forest}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Post-fire salvage logging (SL) is a common management action that
   involves the harvesting of burnt trees. As a consequence, a large amount
   of biological legacies in the form of logs and other coarse woody debris
   are removed from the post-fire habitat, creating a more simplified
   landscape. Therefore, SL could act as an additional disturbance over
   that produced by fire. In this study, we seek to determine the effect of
   SL on the regeneration of the bryophyte community of a laurel forest
   from the Canary Islands (Spain). We hypothesized that SL will act as an
   additional disturbance and, consequently, salvaged areas will have a
   higher difference in community composition with respect to a reference
   ecosystem (RE). Mosses and liverworts were sampled 22 months after the
   salvage operations in salvaged plots, non-salvaged, and in an RE
   represented by areas of the original forest. Species richness did not
   differ between salvage and non-salvaged treatments. However,
   multivariate analysis and species-indicator analysis showed that
   non-salvaged plots had a composition closer to that of the RE, with a
   higher proportion of closed-canopy, perennial, and long-lived species,
   as well as some epiphytes. By contrast, salvaged plots were dominated by
   early-successional terrestrial species and species preferring open
   habitats. We conclude that post-fire SL represents an additional
   disturbance that further delays succession, a result that is consistent
   with previous studies using other taxonomic groups. SL should therefore
   be avoided or, if implemented, the possibility of leaving part of the
   post-fire biological legacies in situ should be considered.}},

Title = {{Influences of fire-vegetation feedbacks and post-fire recovery rates on
   forest landscape vulnerability to altered fire regimes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. In the context of ongoing climatic warming, forest landscapes face
   increasing risk of conversion to non-forest vegetation through
   alteration of their fire regimes and their post-fire recovery dynamics.
   However, this pressure could be amplified or dampened, depending on how
   fire-driven changes to vegetation feed back to alter the extent or
   behaviour of subsequent fires.
   2. Here we develop a mathematical model to formalize understanding of
   how fire-vegetation feedbacks and the time to forest recovery following
   high-severity (i.e. stand-replacing) fire affect the extent and
   stability of forest cover across landscapes facing altered fire regimes.
   We evaluate responses to increasing burn rates while varying the
   direction (negative vs. positive) of fire-vegetation feedbacks under a
   continuum of values for feedback strength and post-fire recovery time.
   In doing so, we determine how interactions among these variables produce
   thresholds and tipping points in landscape responses to changing fire
   regimes.
   3. Where the early-seral vegetation was less fire-prone than older
   forests, negative feedbacks limited the reductions in forest cover in
   response to higher fire frequency or slower forest recovery. By
   contrast, positive feedbacks (more flammable early-seral vegetation)
   produced a tipping point beyond which increases in burn rates or a
   slowing of forest recovery drove extensive forest loss.
   4. With negative feedbacks, the rates of forest loss and expansion in
   response to variation in fire frequency were similar. However, where
   feedbacks were positive, the conversion from predominantly forested to
   non-forested conditions in response to increasing fire frequency was
   faster than the re-expansion of forest cover following a return to the
   initial burn rate. Strengthening the positive feedbacks increased this
   asymmetry.
   5. Synthesis. Our analyses elucidate how fire-vegetation feedbacks and
   post-fire recovery rates interact to affect the trajectories and rates
   of landscape response to altered fire regimes. We illustrate the
   vulnerability of ecosystems with positive fire-vegetation feedbacks to
   climate change-driven increases in fire activity, especially where
   post-fire recovery is slow. Although negative feedbacks initially
   provide resistance to forest loss with increasing burn rates, this
   resistance is eventually overwhelmed with sufficient increases to burn
   rates relative to recovery times.}},

Abstract = {{To study the effects of wildfire on population genetics of a wind
   pollinated and wind dispersed tree,we have analyzed the genetic
   structure of a post-fire,naturally regenerating seedling population of
   Pinus halepensis Miller,on Mt. Carmel, Israel. We tested the existence
   of spatial genetic structure,which is expected due to the special
   spatial demographic structure of the post-fire seedling and sapling
   populations of this species. Explicitly, we asked whether or not
   seedlings that germinated under large, burned, dead pine trees are also
   their offspring. The results revealed that the post-fire seedling
   population is polymorphic, diverse, and reflects the pre-fire random
   mating system. In contrast to our prediction, we found no division of
   the post-fire seedling population to distinct sub-populations.
   Furthermore, as a result of post-fire seed dispersal to longer range
   than the average pre-fire inter-tree distance, seedlings found under
   individual burned trees were not necessarily their sole offspring.
   Although the population as a whole showed a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
   significant excess of heterozygotes was found within each tallest
   seedlings group growing under single, large, burned pine trees. Our
   finding indicates the possible existence of intense natural selection

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are becoming more prevalent and are impacting forests,
   watersheds and important resources. Hydrologic and geomorphic processes
   following wildfires can include erosion flooding, and degraded water
   quality. To mitigate these secondary impacts, post-fire restoration
   treatments can be applied to a burned area to stabilize the land surface
   or promote vegetative regrowth. This research focuses on wood and straw
   mulch treatment implemented after the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado
   (United States) and estimates the spatial and temporal changes in annual
   and seasonal vegetation after a fire with respect to geomorphic factors.
   This study highlights the use of satellite-based remote sensing products
   to investigate the impacts of post-fire rehabilitation treatments on
   vegetation. Using Enhanced Vegetation Index as a proxy for vegetative
   growth, vegetation conditions are evaluated with respect to slope, slope
   aspect, and burn severity to understand the impact of the ground cover
   treatments on vegetation for five years before and after the fire
   (2007-2016). Sixty-three burned and untreated sites, forty-nine burned
   sites treated with wood mulch, and twenty-eight burned sites treated
   with straw mulch were analyzed. These sites were also compared to two
   control sites that were unburned and untreated, Hunter's Run and
   Fountain Creek. Generally, post-fire conditions did not return to
   pre-fire levels, where average vegetation levels were lower. By the end
   of the study, burned and untreated sites had larger vegetative levels
   than burned and treated sites. The vegetation levels of the burned sites
   were statistically different (alpha = 0.05) from pre-fire conditions in
   all areas of treatment. Burned sites treated with wood and straw
   recovered to 69\% and 73\% of pre-fire conditions, respectively. This
   work demonstrates the novel use of remote sensing to observe vegetation
   after post-fire treatment applications to augment the number of sites
   and length of time that can be analyzed. The observed change in
   vegetation conditions also contributes to furthering our understanding
   of the impacts of post-fire restoration, which is important for
   post-fire management.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring adequate conifer regeneration after high severity wildfires is
   a common objective for ecologists and forest managers. In the Klamath
   region of Oregon and California, a global hotspot of botanical
   biodiversity, concerns over regeneration have led to post-fire
   management on many sites, which involves salvage logging followed by
   site preparation, conifer planting, and manual shrub release. To
   quantify the impacts of post-fire management, we sampled 62 field sites
   that burned at high severity nearly 20 years ago in the Klamath-Siskiyou
   Mountain bioregion, stratifying by management and aspect. We measured
   cover of shrubs and trees and density and frequency of trees and used
   Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling to compare community composition,
   plant community assemblage based on regenerative traits, and density of
   tree species between aspect and management. On average, shrub cover
   exceeded the cover of conifers, hardwoods or grasses, regardless of
   management history or aspect. The average number of species was lower
   and resprouting species were less abundant on south aspect sites; seed
   banking species were most abundant on north aspects. Post-fire
   management was associated with greater cover of seed banking and
   nitrogen-fixing species but it did not affect diversity. Management had
   no impact on Douglas-fir regeneration, the main species of concern in
   the region. Regeneration of ponderosa pine was higher on sites with
   post-fire management, but only on south slopes. The frequency of
   Douglas-fir was associated with aspect, while the frequency of ponderosa
   pine was associated with management. Overall, our study demonstrates the
   important role that aspect plays in determining the effectiveness of
   management after high severity wildfires. Indeed, the effect of aspect
   on site conditions often overwhelmed the ability of management to
   influence community composition (including different regenerative
   strategies), species diversity, and regeneration. Managed sites differed
   from unmanaged sites in several diverse ways with varied implications
   for longer-term forest development. Managed sites had taller dominant
   conifers, which suggests that post-fire management could hasten the
   period needed to achieve fire resistance. Managed sites were similar in
   plant community composition but had more homogeneous structure-e.g.,
   managed sites had fewer snags, which are an important habitat feature
   for several bird species in the region. Finally, management was not
   associated with conifer regeneration success on north slopes, suggesting
   that interventions may not be needed uniformly across post-fire

Abstract = {{The frequency and intensity of salvage logging has recently increased in
   burned forests of the Canadian boreal so that post-fire areas make up a
   significant annual share of all harvested forest land in some years.
   However, little is known about how this practice affects
   re-establishment of animal and plant communities that already have been
   strongly altered by the fire. We pitfall-trapped carabid beetles
   (Coleoptera, Carabidae) for two consecutive years following a
   large-scale boreal wildfire (276,000 ha) in burned mixed-wood forests of
   12 landscape units (2.5 km x 2.5 km each). These units included four
   salvage treatments, each replicated three times: control (no salvaging),
   low (ca. 20-30\% of merchantable mixed-wood removed), moderate (40-50\%)
   and high salvage intensity (60-70\%). We established 16 sampling sites
   in each unit: on the control landscapes, all 16 sites were in un-logged
   stands; in low-salvage units, 4 out of 16 sites were in salvaged areas;
   in moderate- and high-salvage units, 8 and 12 out of 16 sites,
   respectively, were in salvaged areas. Salvage logging positively
   affected carabid species richness. However, there was an overall
   salvage-caused decrease in the abundance of many common forest-dwelling
   carabids, and an increase in the abundance of disturbance or
   open-habitat specialists. Interestingly, the effects of salvage logging
   on the total catch and several abundant forest species (e.g., Calosoma
   frigidum, Harpalus laevipes, Pterostichus punctatissimus, P adstrictus
   and Platynus decentis) appeared to be more important at the landscape
   level (the four landscape treatments) than at the level of sampling
   sites (site logged versus not). We suggest that this observation
   resulted from ambiguous site-level responses to salvage that
   collectively contributed to the (mostly negative) significant responses
   at the landscape level. Effects of fire severity (estimates based on
   tree survival) on carabids were species-specific; however, the impact of
   this measure was most often significant at the site, and not at the
   landscape, level. A Multivariate Regression Tree revealed that fire
   severity and the overall (pre-fire) amount of mixed-wood forest on the
   landscape were significant determinants of assemblage structure, with
   the local effects of fire severity being strongest. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Patagonia grasslands are subjected to two main disturbances, fire and

   years: evaluated the effect of early post-fire defoliation on both
   species: and tested whether competition is important in post-fire
   recovery in San Ramon Ranch, NW Patagonia (Argentina). To simulate
   grazing, a clipping treatment was applied at the beginning and end of
   growing seasons. Survival rates were high (>60\%) and, after three
   years, biomass of both species in the burned area was similar to the
   unburned area. Competition seems to play an important role in the early
   post-fire recovery of both species, particularly in the case of F.
   pallescens that increased 87\% the biomass production without

Abstract = {{Within the marl prairie grasslands of the Florida Everglades, USA, the
   combined effects of fire and flooding usually lead to very significant
   changes in tree island structure and composition. Depending on fire
   severity and post-fire hydroperiod, these effects vary spatially and
   temporally throughout the landscape, creating a patchy post-fire mosaic
   of tree islands with different successional states. Through the use of
   the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and three predictor
   variables (marsh water table elevation at the time of fire, post-fire
   hydroperiod, and tree island size), along with logistic regression
   analysis, we examined the probability of tree island burning and
   recovering following the Mustang Corner Fire (May to June 2008) in
   Everglades National Park. Our data show that hydrologic conditions
   during and after fire, which are under varying degrees of management
   control, can lead to tree island contraction or loss. More specifically,
   the elevation of the marsh water table at the time of the fire appears
   to be the most important parameter determining the severity of fire in
   marl prairie tree islands. Furthermore, in the post-fire recovery phase,
   both tree island size and hydroperiod during the first year after the
   fire played important roles in determining the probability of tree
   island recovery, contraction, or loss.}},

   FOREST FIRES IN THE UNITED STATES SOUTHWEST}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{High-severity fires in dry conifer forests of the United States
   Southwest have created large (>1000 ha) treeless areas that are
   unprecedented in the regional historical record. These fires have reset
   extensive portions of South-western ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   Lawson \& C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) forest landscapes. At least
   two recovery options following high-severity fire are emerging. One
   option is for post-fire successional pathways to move toward a return to
   the pre-fire forest type. Alternatively, an area may transition to
   persistent non-forested ecosystems. We studied regeneration patterns of
   ponderosa pine following eight fires in Arizona and New Mexico, USA,
   that burned in dry conifer forests dominated by ponderosa pine during a
   recent 18-year regional drought period, 1996 to 2013. Our a priori
   hypotheses were: 1) the most xeric areas within these severely burned
   dry conifer forests are least likely to regenerate to the pre-fire
   forest type due to persistent post-fire moisture stress; and 2) areas
   farther away from conifer seed sources have a lower likelihood of
   regeneration, even if these areas are climatically favorable for
   post-fire ponderosa pine establishment. We evaluated our hypotheses
   using empirical data and generalized linear mixed-effects models. We
   found that low-elevation, xeric sites are more limiting to conifer
   regeneration than higher-elevation mesic sites. Areas >150 m from a seed
   source are much less likely to have ponderosa pine regeneration. Spatial
   interpolations of modeled post-fire regeneration of ponderosa pine
   across the study landscapes indicate expansive areas with low
   like-lihood of pine regeneration following high-severity fire. We
   discuss multiple post-fire successional pathways following high-severity
   fire, including potentially stable transitions to non-forest vegetation
   types that may represent long-term type conversions. These findings
   regarding landscape changes in Southwest forests in response to fires
   and post-fire regeneration patterns during early-stage climate warming
   contribute to the development of better-informed ecosystem management
   strategies for forest adaptation or mitigation under projected hotter

Abstract = {{Projections of future wildfire regimes forecast an increased frequency
   of large high-severity fires that create very harsh environmental
   conditions and constitute a challenge to post-fire ecosystem
   regeneration. Under these new circumstances, better knowledge of the
   plant interaction mechanisms underlying post fire seedling establishment
   success would aid restoration management to achieve the intended
   targets. We evaluated the combined effect of recurrent large
   stand-replacing fires and conventional post-fire restoration activities
   (salvage logging after a single large fire, and direct seeding and
   linear subsoiling plus seedling planting after two subsequent large
   fires) on tree seedling recruitment and performance (development, annual
   growth, and biomass) in the early stages of succession in fire-prone
   maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) ecosystems. We quantified plant
   facilitative/competitive interactions between naturally recruited pine
   seedlings, neighbouring seedlings and potential nurse shrubs with
   different post-fire regeneration strategies (obligate seeders vs
   resprouters), by computing the relative interaction index (RII). The
   results evidenced that fire recurrence altered plant species composition
   and conditioned initial pine seedling recruitment and establishment,
   prevailing over the expected negative impact of salvage logging and
   positive impact of seeding. Seedling recruitment was sufficient to
   ensure natural tree regeneration after a single fire event and
   undermined by repeated fires. Both delaying burned timber removal during
   salvage logging operations and retaining immature dead trees without
   commercial value onsite in subsoiled stands enhanced seedling
   recruitment via facilitative interactions. Higher seedling growth and
   height under shrubs than in open ground resulted in lower aerial and
   root biomass, indicating elongation in response to shade, and net
   competition for resources. Inter-specific competition between naturally
   regenerated seedlings and shrubs was aggravated by intra-specific
   competition with neighbouring seedlings and by mechanical site
   preparation in subsoiled stands. All in all, post-burn increased soil
   fertility most likely counterbalanced the environmental stress created
   by fire, shifting the net outcome of plant interactions from positive
   (facilitation) to negative (competition). We recommend alternative
   post-fire management actions that decrease plant competition and take
   advantage of facilitation by residual burned wood, to ultimately
   accelerate ecosystem recovery after large stand-replacing fires. (C)

Abstract = {{We tested the extent to which forestry mimics natural stand-replacing
   fire dynamics, and what factors best explain species richness and
   assemblages of polyporous fungi in natural northern boreal Picea
   abies-dominated forests and managed forests which were either clear-cut
   and planted with pine, or selectively logged. The amount of coarse woody
   debris (CWD) and diversity of polypores in old-growth forests and in
   forests at three natural post-fire successional stages (young,
   middle-aged, old) were compared with managed forests at comparable
   successional stages. Fire created a high amount of CWD, providing a
   supply of dead wood for saproxylic species for at least 50-70 y. Dead
   wood volumes remained high throughout the natural forest succession,
   exceeding at all stages 18 m(3) ha(-1), the threshold value established
   in the study for the occurrence of red-listed species. The richness of
   polypore species was highest on young post-fire sites, and their species
   composition, including red-listed species, was comparable to that of
   old-growth forests (>300 y) used as references. The amount of CWD in
   natural post-fire forests was over two to twenty times higher than that
   on clear-cut sites, and species diversity on clear-cut sites was
   considerably lower than on sites undergoing natural succession, with no
   occurrences of red-listed species. A relatively diverse polypore flora
   was found in selectively logged forests, likely due to rather a high
   volume and continuity of spruce CWD. The results indicate a strong but
   non-linear relationship between total volume of CWD and species richness
   of polypores, but successional stage and naturalness also explained part
   of the variation. The species assemblages were influenced most by the
   decay stage of CWD, tree species composition and naturalness of the
   site. The results demonstrate the importance of old-growth and young
   post-fire forests as landscape-level habitats and species pools,
   especially for red-listed species. We recommend that old-growth spruce
   forests be preserved whenever possible and that high CWD volumes be
   generated locally for red-listed species, for example, by prescribed
   burning. Regeneration forests for spruce, extended rotation periods and
   the use of logging techniques other than clear-cutting would help in
   maintaining species diversity in spruce-associated species in boreal

Abstract = {{Fire over the past decade has affected forests in the San Bernardino
   Mountains of southern California, providing an excellent opportunity to
   examine how this disturbance, and subsequent post-fire salvage logging,
   influenced California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis)
   breeding-season site occupancy dynamics there and in the nearby San
   Jacinto Mountains. Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for
   all-detections and pairs-only data, we estimated annual extinction and
   colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 unburned breeding-season
   sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects
   of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in
   habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects
   of fire or salvage logging on occupancy dynamics of spotted owls of
   southern California. However, we found some evidence that fire and
   logging effects could be biologically meaningful. For pairs data, the
   model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and
   extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy
   probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites.
   Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative
   to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship
   between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of
   forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at
   high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and
   roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50ha of forested habitat
   within the core area burned at high severity had extinction
   probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than
   approximately 50ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction
   probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare
   severely burned. The majority (75\%) of sites burned below this
   threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50ha of forested
   habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be
   monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage
   logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We
   also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions
   along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations
   where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire. (c) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Large, high severity fires are becoming more prevalent in Sierra Nevada
   mixed-conifer forests, largely due to heavy fuel loading and forest
   densification caused by past and current management practices. In post
   fire areas distant from seed trees, conifers are often planted to
   re-establish a forest and to prevent a potential type-conversion to
   shrub fields. Typical reforestation efforts promote conifer survival and
   growth by reducing competing shrub cover, yet the effects of these
   practices on plant species richness and composition are not well
   understood. We compared the effects of treatment and time since fire on
   (1) native and exotic plant species richness, (2) plant community
   composition, and (3) stand structure. Plots were installed throughout
   three different aged but proximate fires located in the canyon of the
   South Fork of the American River in California, 10, 22, and 41 years
   after fire. All three fires included large patches of stand-replacing
   fire that had been reforested with conifers as well as unplanted areas.
   Native plant species richness was significantly higher in planted areas
   where shrub cover was lower and planted trees successfully established.
   Native species richness decreased as time since fire increased, but the
   relationship between shrub control and richness persisted. Exotic
   species richness was higher on treated sites in the more recent fires,
   while the opposite was true in the oldest fire. As time since fire
   increased, under story species composition shifted from a community
   dominated by annuals and perennials to one dominated by shrubs and
   shade-tolerant trees. Shrub cover and July soil moisture were the top
   two factors influencing understory richness levels. Natural regeneration
   was low in the youngest fire and high in the oldest fire but highly
   heterogeneous in all three fires. Our study suggests that while
   retaining some shrub cover for post-fire habitat may be desirable, some
   level of shrub reduction does favor native plant richness and overall
   herbaceous cover. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory and fire are two disturbances that often co-occur, but studies
   of their interactive effects are rare outside of grassland ecosystems.
   We experimentally tested the interactive effects of prescribed fire and
   macropod herbivory on forest understory vegetation and its vertebrate
   fauna. Fire and herbivory interacted synergistically to affect forest
   understory vegetation, with palatable plants showing poor post-fire
   recovery in unfenced sites compared with herbivore exclusion sites.
   Despite this strong interactive effect on vegetation, small vertebrates
   responded to the individual, and not the interactive effects of
   disturbance. The native insectivorous mammal Antechinus stuartii was
   more frequently encountered on large herbivore exclusion sites, as was
   the introduced European rabbit. In contrast, the small skink
   Lampropholis delicata was more common on sites with high densities of
   large herbivores. Skinks, snakes and European rabbits were also more
   active on burnt than unburnt sites. Our results suggest that it may be
   necessary to manage the macropod herbivore population after fire to
   prevent the decline of palatable plants, and maintain the dense habitat
   required by some small mammals. However, as the invasive rabbit was most
   active in macropod-free sites after fire, any management must include
   control of both types of herbivores. A mix of understory densities may
   also need to be maintained to ensure the persistence of species
   preferring more open habitats. Our study demonstrates that interactive
   effects of disturbance on vegetation communities may not lead to
   predictable effects on animals, and highlights the importance of
   considering both multiple stressors, and multiple species, in the
   management of disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing amount of high-severity wildfire in historical low and
   mixed-severity fire regimes in western US forests has created a need to
   better understand the ecological effects of different post fire
   management approaches. For three different salvage prescriptions, we
   quantified change in stand structural metrics (snag densities and snag
   basal areas), dead woody fuel loadings, tree regeneration survival, and
   percentage change in vegetation cover before and after post-fire logging
   1 year after the 2015 Stickpin Wildfire on the Colville National Forest
   in northeastern Washington State, USA. In a generalized randomized block
   design three salvage logging prescriptions were randomly assigned within
   each block: no treatment control (C); standard salvage retention (SSR;
   thin to 3.4 m(2)/ha basal area); and mimic green tree thinning (GTR;
   thin to 10.3 m(2)/ha basal area). SSR reduced average snag basal area
   73-83\% to 4.1-8.8 m(2)/ha (68-674 trees ha(-1)). GTR reduced average
   snag (standing dead trees) basal area 41-71\% to 6.5-15.9 m(2)/ha
   (90-794 trees ha(-1)). There were mixed results for the change in dead
   woody fuel loadings depending on fuel size class. In general, fine (FWD)
   and coarse woody (CWD) debris tended to increase immediately
   post-treatment in logged areas relative to the controls but did not
   exceed management loading threshold for providing acceptable risk of
   fire hazard. Treated stands had a significant increase in FWD relative
   to controls, including the individual 1-, 10-, and 100-hr fuel size
   classes. The treatment effect differed by experimental block. The
   1000-hr sound class did not have a significant treatment effect. Changes
   in surface fuel loading were inconsequential to modeled wildfire
   behavior metrics (rate-of-spread, flame lengths). The Fire and Fuels
   Extension to Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS) modeling projected
   CWD accumulation in the controls exceeded total accumulation in both
   treatments. Future fuel loadings may affect reburn severity as our
   simulated wildfire 20 years after harvesting caused significant
   mortality (89\%) to regenerating forest. Almost all blocks showed a
   decrease in seedling counts pre and post-logging, including the control
   plots. This study provides empirical data on the effects of different
   post-fire management strategies that can inform environmental analyses
   for future post-fire management decision and address social concerns
   associated with this often-controversial practice (Roccaforte et al.,
   2012).}},

Abstract = {{Soil contains a wide variety of microorganisms that are responsible for
   fundamental ecological processes. However, increased frequency and
   severity of fires reduce microbial diversity and alter soil nutrient
   availability, affecting vegetation recovery. By using a large-scale
   wildfire that burned endangered Araucaria araucana forests in
   south-central Chile (38 degrees S), we assessed the short-term post-fire
   response of microorganisms, soil nutrients, and plant recovery. One year
   after fire, we sampled soils from burned and unburned areas, and
   measured the number of bacterial and fungal colony forming units, and
   the microbiological activity of the soil. We also measured soil
   nutrients (N, P, and K), organic matter content and species richness,
   abundance and plant diversity after fire. We found a significant
   increase in microbiological activity in burned soils (BS) compared to
   unburned soils (UBS), with bacteria and fungi being four and seven times
   greater in BS than in UBS, respectively. Concentrations of N, P and K
   were also greater in BS than in UBS. Plant species richness was two
   times higher in unburned than in burned areas, with a drastic reduction
   of the dominant tree species Araucaria araucana and Nothofagus pumilio
   after fire. The changes in soil properties after fire may be related to
   organic matter mineralization, the contribution of nutrients from ashes,
   or due to post-fire conditions (e.g., increased soil temperature after
   canopy removal by fire). Overall, our study shows a positive, short-term
   response in soil microorganisms abundance and nutrient content, but a
   rapid initial reduction of plant diversity of the main dominant tree
   species in these forest ecosystems after a severe fire. Further research
   is necessary as vegetation results are only preliminary and they can
   vary in the short-to-medium term. Our study provides insightful clues to
   delve into more applied research aimed at the post-fire restoration of
   the endemic, long-lived Araucaria araucana forests.}},

Volume = {{149}},

Abstract = {{The season in which a fire occurs may regulate plant seedling
   recruitment because of: (1) the interaction of season and intensity of
   fire and the temperature requirements for seed release, germination and
   growth; (2) post-fire rainfall and temperature patterns affecting
   germination; (3) the interaction of post-fire germination conditions and
   competition from surrounding vegetation; and (4) the interaction of
   post-fire germination conditions and seed predators and/or seedling
   herbivores. This study examined the effects of different fire
   intensities and fire seasons on the emergence and survival of shrubs
   representing a range of fire response syndromes from a summer rainfall
   cool climate region. Replicated experimental burns were conducted in two
   seasons (spring and autumn) in 2 consecutive years and fuel loads were
   increased to examine the effects of fire intensity (low intensity and
   moderate intensity). Post-fire watering treatments partitioned the
   effects of seasonal temperature from soil moisture. Higher intensity
   fires resulted in enhanced seedling emergence for hard-seeded species
   but rarely influenced survival. Spring fires enhanced seedling emergence
   across all functional groups. Reduced autumn recruitment was related to
   seasonal temperature inhibiting germination rather than a lack of soil
   moisture or competition. In Mediterranean-type climate regions, seedling
   emergence has been related to post-fire rainfall and exposure of seeds
   to seed predators. We think a similar model may operate in temperate
   summer rainfall regions where cold-induced dormancy over winter exposes
   seeds to predators for a longer time and subsequently results in
   recruitment failure. Our results support the theory that the effect of
   fire season is more predictable where there are strong seasonal patterns
   in climate. In this study seasonal temperature rather than rainfall
   appears to be more influential.}},

   vegetation regrowth was monitored and vegetal species richness (S),
   evenness (I-T), density (D), diversity (H `) and maximum diversity
   (HMax) after 2, 10 and 18 months. The treatments were (1) control,

Abstract = {{Post-fire regeneration of Pinus halepensis, the most abundant tree in
   the Mediterranean Basin, can vary largely. In the present work, we aim
   to study the parameters determining this variability in the eastern
   Iberian Peninsula. For this reason we sampled in 2002 the sapling pine
   density on 22 plots that burned in 1993 and 71 plots that burned in
   1994. Pre-fire vegetation (tree density and basal area) were obtained
   from the Spanish Forest Inventory. The regeneration ranged from 0.006 to
   20.4 pines/m(2) (mean = 1.24, S.D. = 3.22). The statistical analysis
   suggested that the most important variables explaining this variability
   were the amount of branches found on the forest floor (branches
   collapsed from burned trees or branches left by foresters), the aspect
   of the plot, the pre-fire basal area, and whether the slope was terraced
   or not. High regeneration was observed in forests with large amounts of
   branches on the floor (which create appropriate microclimatic
   conditions), with northern aspects, with high pre-fire basal area, and
   on terraced slopes. Furthermore, other water-related variables (annual
   precipitation and slope) also had some (although lower) importance.
   These results have direct implications for forest managers in the study
   area. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   area located in Sardinia, Italy. We compared no-treatment conditions v.

   25 000 wildfires for each condition using the minimum travel time
   fire-spread algorithm. The fire simulations replicated historic
   conditions associated with severe wildfires in the study area. Sediment
   delivery was then estimated using the Erosion Risk Management Tool

Abstract = {{Aims Wildfires in dry forest ecosystems in western North America are
   producing fire effects that are more severe than historical estimates,
   raising concerns about the resilience of these landscapes to
   contemporary disturbances. Despite increasing fire activity, relatively
   little is known about the structure and composition of fire refugia -
   unburned or low-severity burned patches where trees survived fire - or
   the degree to which their understory composition differs from
   fire-generated early-seral forests. Locations Four recent large fires in
   dry mixed-conifer forest in eastern Oregon, USA. Methods We sampled
   vegetation and environmental factors in 187 plots (100-m(2)) in fire
   refugia (n = 52) and stand-replacement patches (SRPs) (n = 135). We used
   non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicator species analysis, and
   randomization tests to compare understory plant communities and
   diversity in fire refugia and SRPs 12-17 years post-fire. Results
   Understory plant communities in fire refugia and SRPs showed strong
   compositional affinities, but exhibited shifts in reproductive trait
   prevalence and differences in landscape-scale species richness. There
   were no differences in plot-scale species richness or the occurrence of
   two prominent invasive annual grasses (Bromus tectorum, Ventenata
   dubia). The abundance of common obligate seeding species was similar
   between plot types, but resprouting and seed-banking species became
   substantially more abundant in SRPs. Significantly more plant species
   occurred only in fire refugia, and significantly fewer in SRPs, than
   expected by chance. Conclusions Similarities in understory plant
   communities between fire refugia and early-seral forest in SRPs provide
   evidence for the resilience of historically frequent-fire forest
   understory communities to contemporary fire effects. However, fire
   refugia may serve an ecologically important role as patches with
   relatively intact forest structure, seed sources that contribute to
   post-fire forest recovery, and as reservoirs of species and age
   structure that may be absent from the higher-severity burned matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Background Fire has historically been a primary control on succession
   and vegetation dynamics in boreal systems, although modern changing
   climate is potentially increasing fire size and frequency. Large, often
   remote fires necessitate large-scale estimates of fire effects and
   consequences, often using Landsat satellite-derived dNBR (differenced
   Normalized Burn Ratio) to estimate burn severity. However, few studies
   have examined long-term field measures of ecosystem condition in
   relation to dNBR severity classes in boreal Alaska, USA. The goals of
   this study were: 1) assess changes in dominant vegetation at plots
   resampled one and 12 years post fire; 2) use dNBR classes to
   characterize vegetation and downed woody fuels 12 years post fire; and
   3) characterize the relationship between biophysical, topographic, and
   remotely sensed characteristics (e.g., moss and duff depth, canopy
   cover, elevation, aspect, dNBR) and understory species assemblages 12
   years post fire. Results Understory species richness doubled (from 39 to
   73) between 2005 and 2016; some common species increased in cover over
   time (e.g., Ledum groenlandicum Oeder) while others decreased (e.g.,
   Hylocomium splendens {[}Hedw.] Schimp.). In 2016, live and dead tree
   densities, tall shrub cover, and 1- and 100-h woody fuels were
   significantly different among dNBR classes; moss and duff depth, canopy
   cover, and spruce seedling density were not. Elevation and aspect
   significantly influenced tall shrub cover, hardwood sapling density, and
   downed woody fuel loads. Understory plant communities differed between
   unburned and all burn classes, as well as between low and high dNBR
   severity. Ordination analysis showed that overstory (e.g., live tree
   density), understory (e.g., moss depth, woody fuel loading), and site
   (elevation, aspect, dNBR) significantly influences understory species
   assemblages. Conclusion Remeasured sites (sampled one and 12 years post
   fire) showed recruitment of new understory species and differing,
   diverse responses to burning by several common plant species. In 2016,
   low-severity burned sites had generally the highest woody fuel loading,
   which may increase risk of repeated surface burning, although the
   reduction in live tree density would still result in decreased fire risk
   and behavior. Understory community composition correlated with multiple
   biotic and abiotic factors, including moss depth, canopy cover,
   elevation, aspect, and dNBR. Overall, our findings can improve
   landscape-level predictions of ecosystem condition following fire based
   on dNBR.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire tree mortality models are vital tools used by forest land
   managers to predict fire effects, estimate delayed mortality and develop
   management prescriptions. We evaluated the performance of mortality
   models within the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) software, and
   compared their performance to locally-parameterised models based on five
   different forms. We evaluated all models at the individual tree and
   stand levels with a dataset comprising 34 174 trees from a mixed-conifer
   forest in the Sierra Nevada, California that burned in the 2013 Rim
   Fire. We compared stand-level accuracy across a range of spatial scales,
   and we used point pattern analysis to test the accuracy with which
   mortality models predict post-fire tree spatial pattern. FOFEM
   under-predicted mortality for the three conifers, possibly because of
   the timing of the Rim Fire during a severe multi-year drought.
   Locally-parameterised models based on crown scorch were most accurate in
   predicting individual tree mortality, but tree diameter-based models
   were more accurate at the stand level for Abies concolor and
   large-diameter Pinus lambertiana, the most abundant trees in this
   forest. Stand-level accuracy was reduced by spatially correlated error
   at small spatial scales, but stabilised at scales >= 1 ha. The
   predictive error of FOFEM generated inaccurate predictions of post-fire
   spatial pattern at small scales, and this error could be reduced by
   improving FOFEM model accuracy for small trees.}},

Abstract = {{Plant community diversity measured as species richness, is typically
   highest in the early post-fire years in California shrublands. However,
   this generalization is overly simplistic and the present study
   demonstrates that diversity is determined by a complex of temporal and
   spatial effects. Ninety sites distributed across southern California
   were studied for 5 years after a series of fires. Characteristics of the
   disturbance event, in this case fire severity, call alter post-fire
   diversity, both decreasing and increasing diversity, depending on life
   form. Spatial variability in resource availability is an important
   factor explaining patterns of diversity, and there is a complex
   interaction between landscape features and life form. Temporal
   variability in resource availability affects diversity, and the
   diversity peak in the immediate post-fire year (or two) appears to be
   driven by factors different from subsequent diversity peaks. Early
   post-fire diversity is influenced by life-history specialization,
   illustrated by species that spend the bulk of their life cycle as a
   dormant seed bank, which is then triggered to germinate by fire.
   Resource fluctuations, precipitation in particular, may be associated
   with subsequent post-fire diversity peaks. These later peaks in
   diversity comprise a flora that is compositionally different from the
   immediate post-fire flora, and their presence may be due to mass effects
   from population expansion of local populations in adjacent burned areas.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is known to be a major factor in shaping plants and vegetation
   worldwide. Many plant traits have been described as adaptations for
   surviving fire, or regenerating after it. However, many of the traits
   are also advantageous for overcoming other disturbances. The fact that
   fire in the Mediterranean Basin has been almost exclusively of
   anthropogenic origin. and thus is of short duration in an evolutionary
   time scale, cast doubt on the possibility that fire can act as a
   selective force in the Mediterranean Basin. Our aim here is to review
   the ecological advantages of Pinus halepensis traits and their
   possibility to be selected by fire. The non-self pruning of cones and
   branches, and the high resin content increase the probability of canopy
   fires and consequent death of P halepensis trees. Postfire regeneration
   of P. halepensis depends totally upon its canopy-stored seed bank. The
   seedlings grow quickly and they first reproduce at an early age. Young
   reproductive trees function first as females with a high percentage of
   serotinous cones. Thus, young P. halepensis trees allocate many
   resources to seed production, reducing their `immaturity risk' in a case
   of an early successive fire. The proportion of serotinous cones is
   higher in post-fire naturally regenerating stands than in unburned
   stands, and seeds from serotinous cones germinate better under simulated
   post-fire conditions. The extremely high pH of the ash-bed under the
   burned canopies creates the post-fire regeneration niche of P.
   halepensis exactly under their parent trees. All these traits are
   advantageous for post-fire regeneration, but Could they also be selected
   during the time scale of anthropogenic fires in the Mediterranean Basin?
   Pinus halepensis is a relatively short living tree with almost no
   recruitment under forest canopy. The longest estimated fire-return
   interval and generation length are about 125 years. The earliest solid
   evidence for the first hominid-controlled fire in the Mediterranean
   basin is 780,000 years ago, and thus the estimated number of post-fire
   generations is 6240. We suggest that such a number of generations is
   sufficient for the selection and radiation of fire adaptive traits in P
   halepensis.}},

Abstract = {{The recent increase in wildfire activity across the rangeland-xeric
   forest continuum in the western United States has landscape-scale
   consequences in terms of runoff and erosion. Concomitant cheatgrass
   (Bromus tectorum L.) invasions, plant community transitions and a
   warming climate in recent decades along
   grassland-shrubland-woodland-xeric forest transitions have promoted
   frequent and large wildfires, and continuance of the trend appears
   likely if warming climate conditions prevail. These changes potentially
   increase overall hydrologic vulnerability by spatially and temporally
   increasing soil exposure to runoff and erosion processes. Plot and
   hillslope-scale studies demonstrate burning may increase event runoff or
   erosion by factors of 2-40 over small-plot scales and more than 100-fold
   over large-plot to hillslope scales. Reports of flooding and debris flow
   events from rangelands and xeric forests following burning show the
   potential risk to natural resources, property, infrastructure and human
   life. We present a conceptual model for evaluating post-fire hydrologic
   vulnerability and risk. We suggest that post-fire risk assessment of
   potential hydrologic hazards should adopt a probability-based approach
   that considers varying site susceptibility in conjunction with a range
   of potential storms and that determines the hydrologic response
   magnitudes likely to affect values-at-risk. Our review suggests that
   improved risk assessment requires better understanding in several key
   areas including quantification of interactions between varying storm
   intensities and measures of site susceptibility, the varying effects of
   soil water repellency, and the spatial scaling of post-fire hydrologic
   response across rangeland-xeric forest plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Drought-induced wildfires have increased in frequency and extent over
   the tropics. Yet, the long-term (greater than 10 years) responses of
   Amazonian lowland forests to fire disturbance are poorly known. To
   understand post-fire forest biomass dynamics, and to assess the time
   required for fire-affected forests to recover to pre-disturbance levels,
   we combined 16 single with 182 multiple forest census into a unique
   large-scale and long-term dataset across the Brazilian Amazonia. We
   quantified biomass, mortality and wood productivity of burned plots
   along a chronosequence of up to 31 years post-fire and compared to
   surrounding unburned plots measured simultaneously. Stem mortality and
   growth were assessed among functional groups. At the plot level, we
   found that fire-affected forests have biomass levels 24.8 +/- 6.9\%
   below the biomass value of unburned control plots after 31 years. This
   lower biomass state results from the elevated levels of biomass loss
   through mortality, which is not sufficiently compensated for by wood
   productivity (incremental growth thorn recruitment). At the stem level,
   we found major changes in mortality and growth rates up to 11 years
   post-fire. The post-fire stem mortality rates exceeded unburned control
   plots by 680\% (i.e. greater than 40 cm diameter at breast height (DBH);
   5-8 years since last fire) and 315\% (i.e. greater than 0.7 g cm(-3)
   wood density; 0.75-4 years since last fire). Our findings indicate that
   wildfires in humid tropical forests can significantly reduce forest
   biomass for decades by enhancing mortality rates of all trees, including
   large and high wood density trees, which store the largest amount of
   biomass in old-growth forests. This assessment of stem dynamics,
   therefore, demonstrates that wildfires slow down or stall the post-fire
   recovery of Amazonian forests.

Abstract = {{Natural resource managers sow grass, forb, and shrub seeds across

   sagebrush-steppe ecological sites in southwestern Idaho. Insect

   Insect communities in burned plots did not resemble those in reference

Abstract = {{Large scale, high-severity fires are increasing in the western United
   States. Despite this trend, there have been few studies investigating
   post-fire tree regeneration. We established a study in the footprint of
   the 2000 Storrie Fire, a 23,000 ha wildfire that occurred in northern
   California, USA. We used a stratified sampling design to quantify
   post-fire vegetation dynamics across four levels of burn severity and
   three forest types on the Lassen National Forest nine and ten years
   following fire. Within each sampled stand, we recorded tree seedlings,
   forest overstory, shrub cover, and abiotic factors hypothesized to
   influence growth and establishment.
   Median conifer seedling densities varied substantially by burn severity:
   1918 seedlings ha(-1) in the Unchanged units; 4838 seedlings ha(-1) in
   the Low-severity units; 6484 seedlings ha(-1) in the Medium-severity
   units; and 710 seedlings ha(-1) in the High-severity units. Increased
   burn severity was associated with greater shrub coverage: shrub cover in
   High-severity burns was more than three times those of lower burn
   severities. We calculated Shannon's Species Diversity (H') and Pielou's
   Evenness (E-H) indices to examine woody shrub and tree diversity. Abies
   spp. were by far the most abundant regenerating conifer species, which
   may be a concern for land managers; shrub cover after High-severity
   burns was dominated by Ceanothus spp. Although fir regeneration was
   prolific, the Storrie Fire generated diverse vegetative responses,
   potentially aiding in the reintroduction of the diverse landscape mosaic
   homogenized by a century of landscape-scale fire exclusion. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Severe wildfires infrequently occur in large heterogeneous riparian
   valleys. Riparian areas may affect fire behavior and the pattern of
   burning due to saturated soils and patchy fuels that may have high
   moisture content in live and dead stems. We examined the effects of a
   severe fire on the dominant riparian vegetation: thin-leaf alder, river
   birch and willow, in a broad riparian valley in Rocky Mountain National
   Park, CO, USA. We mapped the canopy stem mortality and basal resprouting
   of 4507 first year post fire and 643 second year post fire individuals
   that had been the dominant woody canopy. To examine the effect of
   herbivory on resprouting willow stems, we established a paired
   experiment with 22 willows exclosed in cages to prevent browsing and 22
   uncaged control plants. Aerial seed rain sticky traps were established
   on transects throughout the study area and pre-fire seed rain density
   was compared with post-fire seed rain densities.
   Fire effects on willow were severe, with 91\% of individuals having
   complete canopy loss. Fifty-one percent of thin-leaf alder individuals
   and 71\% of river birch individuals also had complete canopy loss.
   Seventy-four percent of river birch, 45\% of willow and 35\% of
   thin-leaf alder resprouted from the base in the first summer post fire.
   In the second year post fire, 84\% of river birch, 62\% of thin-leaf
   alder and 55\% of willow had resprouted. Willows inside exclosures had
   greater biomass at the end of the growing season compared with willows
   outside exdosures. Summer browsing resulted in significantly lower
   willow biomass compared with exclosed plants and the additive effect of
   summer and winter browsing resulted in control plants having 64\%
   reduction in biomass. Post-fire aerial seed rain was 90\% lower than
   pre-fire densities.
   Fire dramatically altered the riparian vegetation. Willow seed rain was
   nearly eliminated because most stems were killed by fire. Resprouting
   woody riparian vegetation was prevalent however, ungulate browsing of
   the resprouting willow stems could limit the regrowth of a tall willow
   riparian overstory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effect of burnt tree removal on post-fire natural
   regeneration of Pinus halepensis, two 2500 m(2) areas were selected six
   months after the fire in a totally destroyed mature (>70 years) pine
   forest. In one area, all the trees were cut down and removed 10 months
   after the fire and, in the other, all the trees were left standing
   (control). In each area, 20 permanent plots of 20 m(2) each were
   randomly placed, and all seedlings emerging within them labeled by
   individual numbered plastic tags. Emergence, mortality, density and
   growth (height) of 6649 P. halepensis seedlings were monitored during
   the: first four post-fire years. Seedling emergence was concentrated in
   the first post-fire autumn-winter period. No positive effect on seedling
   emergence was detected as a consequence of burnt trunk dragging and
   subsequent turning over of soil. Wood removal produced an immediate
   average seedling mortality of 33\%, and notably increased seedling
   mortality during the subsequent summer, probably due to increased
   exposure of seedlings to sunlight and the possible debilitation of many
   individuals by mechanical contact during burnt wood removal. A negative
   correlation of pine seedling mortality with height was detected, which
   increased significantly on wood removal in the third post-fire year.
   That is, short seedlings (<10 cm) in treated plots were the most likely
   to die during this period. In spite of the detrimental effect of wood
   removal on sapling survival, seedling density four years after fire in
   the cleared area was large (3.3 seedlings/m(2)). Wood removal treatment
   reduced seedling growth: seedling height was significantly higher in the
   control stand, and differences in seedling height growth rate became
   particularly noticeable in the fourth post-fire year. The results denote
   that traditional wood removal practices do not threaten natural
   post-fire P. halepensis re-establishment if initial seedling density is
   large enough. However, further studies focused on wood removal effects
   on the final tree development level and other ecological aspects are
   necessary to choose adequate postfire forest management. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Salvage logging, the removal for profit of standing trees that have been
   damaged by extensive wildfires, has been quite controversial and subject
   to lawsuits that can delay the logging post the time in which the lumber
   is still useful. It has not been clear, however, whether the public that
   has been most affected by wildfires-those that live near burned
   areas-support or oppose postfire logging. In this research we use focus
   groups and stakeholder interviews in urban interface communities that
   have experienced significant wildfires to examine in some detail the
   perspectives these members of the public have regarding salvage logging.
   Public support for salvage logging in communities that have recently
   experienced wildfires was much stronger than hypothesized at the
   beginning of this study from our review of the number of unsuccessful
   salvage logging proposals or even popular press reports. Key reasons for
   supporting salvage logging were that letting useful timber rot was
   wasteful, that it improves the postfire aesthetics and safety of the
   forest, and that it can provide some income for local postfire
   restoration activities. Caveats include assuring that any environmental
   impacts, such as new roads, are mitigated postlogging, and assuring that
   appropriate snags are left to provide wildlife habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Land abandonment and the cessation of traditional management practices
   is favouring scrubland and forest expansion throughout Europe, reducing
   the extent of many semi-natural open habitats of a high ecological
   value. Tree encroachment is threatening several Calluna vulgaris (L.)
   Hull heathlands. The objective of this study was to analyze vegetation
   dynamics resulting from an experiment designed to test management
   options aiming at controlling the encroachment of Populus tremula
   (aspen) and favouring heathland recovery. The research was conducted at
   Vauda Heath, North-western Italy, from 2005 till 2009. We studied
   prescribed burning and goat browsing, both alone or in combination,
   assessing their effects on structure and density of encroaching trees,
   as well as on heathland main species, C vulgaris and Molinia
   arundinacea. Treatments were applied to 42 experimental units (300-650
   m(2) each), with each treatment combination replicated from six to
   twelve times (including untreated controls).
   Prescribed burning and browsing showed complementary effects on
   post-fire vegetation development. Both back and head fire behaviors were
   effective in inducing stem mortality of aspen and rejuvenating the
   heathland, but in the absence of measures to control post-fire
   suckering, aspen tended to recover the pre-treatment stand structure. A
   higher fire frequency (annual winter fire) controlled tree encroachment,
   but hindered Calluna recovery, whilst favouring competing grass species.
   Goat browsing alone was initially able to reduce tree growth and slow
   down woodland expansion, until aspen individuals reached an escape size
   of 1.5 m in height. Prescribed burning followed by yearly goat browsing
   effectively contained tree encroachment while maximizing post-fire
   heathland regeneration. This integrated approach thus proved its
   efficacy also at the southern limits of Calluna distributional area. (C)

   sets of models were created: one for use in pre-fire planning in which
   only crown injury and tree diameter (DBH) were potential variables, and
   a second, optimal model for use in post-fire planning that used all
   significant variables. Predictive accuracy of all models was compared to
   the accuracy of the general, non-species specific mortality model used
   in the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) prior to version 5.7. The
   new species-specific models improved prediction of fire-caused tree
   mortality by 0 \% to 48 \%. Model accuracy increased the most for red
   fir, incense cedar, western larch, and whitebark pine, and increased the
   least for Engelmann spruce. The models in the post-fire option provided
   higher accuracy compared to the pre-fire models, but also required
   additional inputs. These new models were added to FOFEM beginning with
   version 5.7, and the options in the FOFEM Mortality Module were
   expanded. We describe the new options in FOFEM and how to use the
   software to predict tree mortality for pre-fire and post-fire planning,
   as well as modeling limitations and assumptions. The additions to FOFEM
   offer improved accuracy in predicting post-fire tree mortality for 12
   Western conifer species and allow direct inputs of fire injury to

Abstract = {{In spring 1994, the Intermountain Research Station (now Rocky Mountain
   Research Station), Boise National Forest, and Region 4 of the Forest
   Service initiated long-term studies on bird responses to different fire
   conditions in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests of southwestern Idaho.
   The first phase of the project is to evaluate effects of high-intensity
   wildfire on cavity-nesting bi rds and their associated habitats. During
   spring/summer 1994-1996 we monitored 695 nests of nine cavity-nesting
   bird species (including three Forest Service Sensitive Species:
   Black-backed, White-headed, and Lewis' woodpeckers) and measured
   vegetation at nest sites and at 90 randomly located sites. The burned
   forests used for study areas were created in 1992 and 1994 by primarily
   high-intensity wildfire, thus most standing trees were snags. Nests and
   vegetation were monitored in three treatments: standard-cut salvage
   logged, wildlife-prescription salvage logged, and unlogged controls.
   Tree densities for small diameter trees (>23 cm to less than or equal to
   53 cm {[}>9{''} to less than or equal to 20{''}] diameter breast height
   {[}dbh]) in the unlogged units averaged 81 snags per ha (33 per acre)
   and for larger trees (>53 cm dbh {[}>20{''}]) averaged 17 snags per ha
   (7 per acre). In salvage-logged units about 50\% of the trees were
   harvested, tree densities for small trees averaged 43 snags per ha (17
   per acre) and for large trees ave raged 5 snags per ha (2 per acre).
   Lewis' Woodpecker was the most abundant (208 nests) and successful
   cavity nester on the 2-4 year-old burns, while Black-backed and
   White-headed woodpeckers were rare (23 nests). Lewis' Woodpecker and
   American Kestrel experienced the highest nesting success in the
   salvage-logged units, whereas Northern Flicker and Hairy Woodpecker were
   most successful in the unlogged units. All bird species selected nest
   sites with higher tree densities than that measured at random sites, and
   cavity nesters as a group selected clumps of snags rather than snags
   that were retained in uniform, evenly-spaced distributions. Among bird
   species, Black-backed Woodpeckers used nest sites with the highest tree
   densities, while Lewis' Woodpeckers selected relatively open nest sites.
   Cavity-nesters as a group selected larger diameter and more heavily
   decayed snags than that expected based on availability of such snags.
   Snags with the highest probability (>85\%) of being classified as nest
   trees were characterized by heavy decay and broken tops that pre-dated
   the wildfire. We discuss management implications of stand-replacement
   fire and post-fire salvage logging for cavity-nesting birds. Future
   plans are outlined, including bird and plant responses to different fire
   conditions (stand-replacement fire, fire suppression, and prescribed
   fire). The intent of this work is to provide information on the action
   and no action alternatives to the Forest Health Initiative.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is a primary mechanism structuring ecological communities.
   However, human activity has the potential to alter the frequency and
   intensity of natural disturbance regimes, with subsequent effects on
   ecosystem processes. In Southern California, human development has led
   to increased fire frequency close to urban areas that can forma positive
   feedback with invasive plant spread. Understanding how abiotic and
   biotic factors structure post-fire plant communities is a critical
   component of post-fire management and restoration. In this study we
   considered a variety of mechanisms affecting post-fire vegetation
   recovery in Riversidean sage scrub. Comparing recently burned plots to
   unburned plots, we found that burning significantly reduced species
   richness and percent cover of exotic vegetation the first two years
   following a 100-hectare wildfire. Seed rain was higher in burned plots,
   with more native forb seeds, while unburned plots had more exotic grass
   seeds. Moreover, there were significant correlations between seed rain
   composition and plant cover composition the year prior and the year
   after. Collectively, this case study suggests that fire can alter
   community composition, but there was not compelling evidence of a
   vegetation-type conversion. Instead, the changes in the community
   composition were temporary and convergence in community composition was
   apparent within two years post-fire.}},

Abstract = {{Global environmental change has increased forest vulnerability to the
   occurrence of interacting disturbances, including wildfires and invasive

   often faces challenges because burned and infested trees may exhibit a
   high similarity in spectral reflectance. In this study, we combined
   (pre- and post-fire) Landsat imagery and (post-fire) high-spectral
   resolution airborne MASTER data {[}MODIS (moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer)/ASTER (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and
   reflection radiometer)] to map burn severity in a California coastal
   forest environment, where a non-native forest disease sudden oak death
   (SOD) was causing substantial tree mortality. Results showed that the
   use of Landsat plus MASTER bundle performed better than using the
   individual sensors in most of the evaluated forest strata from ground to
   canopy layers (i.e., substrate, shrubs, intermediate-sized trees,
   dominant trees and average), with the best model performance achieved at
   the dominant tree layer. The mid to thermal infrared spectral bands
   (3.0-12.5 mu m) from MASTER were found to augment Landsat's visible to
   shortwave infrared bands in burn severity assessment. We also found that
   infested and uninfested forests similarly experienced moderate to high
   degrees of burns where CBI (composite burn index) values were higher
   than 1. However, differences occurred in the regions with low burn
   severity (CBI values lower than 1), where uninfested stands revealed a
   much lower burn effect than that in infested stands, possibly due to
   their higher resilience to small fire disturbances as a result of higher
   leaf water content. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires arc along the main disturbances and the most devastating
   degradation factors that can affect forested areas, especially in the
   Mediterranean basin where plants are highly inflammable and with dry and
   hot climate conditions. Morocco, as a Mediterranean country, is not
   spared by this phenomenon, thus 3000 ha of forest are burnt every year,
   and this situation is aggravated by the low rate of regeneration and
   restoration of the unbalanced ecosystems such as the Maamora. The
   establishment of an effective forest fire management plan to make
   forests more resilient and more resistant to fire requires an intimate
   knowledge of fire behaviour and vegetation response after fire in order
   to take the appropriate measures in terms of fuel treatment (clearing,
   pruning and thinning) and also for post-fire restoration. The main aim
   of the current study is to propose a model to assess fire severity and
   post-fire recovery. A sample of 96 fires that occurred in Maamora from
   1997 until 2011 was selected, and fire intensity for each sample fire
   has been estimated using parametric equations of FIRETEC and Byram's
   formula. Moreover satellite images processed for each sample fire has
   permitted at first to assess fire severity through the Normalized Burn
   Index (NBR), and secondly to estimate the rate of post-fire recovery
   through Normalized Regeneration Index (NRI). The statistical modeling of
   collected data using SAS program has led to build models of fire
   severity and fire recovery. Finally to make the use of established

   By 1989, most of the burnt area was dominated by two species of Cistus,

   largely variable with an overall average around 60 cm.
   The striking discovery of numerous, very short (10-20 cm) saplings,
   evidently suppressed by neighboring vegetation, led to the postulate
   that a pine sapling bank may be formed during the early post-fire

Abstract = {{Pinus-Juniperus L. (Pion-juniper) woodlands of the western United States
   have expanded in area nearly 10-fold since the late 1800's. Juniperus
   occidentalis ssp. occidentalis Hook. (western juniper) dominance in
   sagebrush steppe has several negative consequences, including reductions
   in herbaceous production and diversity, decreased wildlife habitat, and
   higher erosion and runoff potentials. Prescribed fire and mechanical
   tree removal are the main methods used to control J. occidentalis and
   restore sagebrush steppe. However, mature woodlands become difficult to
   prescribe burn because of the lack of understory fuels. We evaluated
   partial cutting of the woodlands (cutting 25-50\% of the trees) to
   increase surface fuels, followed by prescribed fire treatments in late
   successional J. occidentalis woodlands of southwest Idaho to assess
   understory recovery. The study was conducted in two different plant
   associations and evaluated what percentage of the woodland required
   preparatory cutting to eliminate remaining J. occidentalis by prescribed
   fire, determined the impacts of fire to understory species, and examined
   early post-fire successional dynamics. The study demonstrated that late
   successional J. occidentalis woodlands can be burned after pre-cutting
   only a portion of the trees. Early succession in the cut-and-burn
   treatments were dominated by native annual and perennial forbs, in part
   due to high mortality of perennial bunchgrasses. By the third year after
   fire the number of establishing perennial grass seedlings indicated that
   both associations would achieve full herbaceous recovery.
   Cutting-prescribed fire combinations are an effective means for
   controlling encroaching late successional J. occidentalis and restoring

Volume = {{415}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are likely to have a major influence on below-ground patterns
   and processes in forests but these effects and their consequences to
   forest succession are generally poorly known. Ectomycorrhizal macrofungi
   (ECM) is a key below-ground ecological group, mainly because of their
   functional relationships to trees. During severe fire disturbances,
   below-ground mycelia of ECM may be negatively affected. This study
   analyses long-term effects of a wildfire on ECM assemblages.
   Using data from 12-years post-fire succession of ECM, we investigated
   the long-term fire effects on ECM, focusing on the effects of spatial
   variability in fire severity. The wildfire occurred in 1992 in eastern
   Finland, and covered 143 ha. We established sampling plots to four types
   of sites within the burned area, based on the observed fire severity,
   and also on unburned control sites. ECM assemblages were surveyed every
   autumn during the following 12 years period. A total of 133 ECM species
   and 14 469 ECM sporocarps were sampled.
   Fire severity was closely associated with the post-fire ECM richness and
   assemblage patterns. The highest overall ECM species richness was in the
   low severity surface fire area, 87 species in total, followed by the
   intermediate ground fire area, 72 species; they both included
   post-disturbance ECM pioneer species but also species that are usually
   associated with old-growth forests. The high-severity crown fire area
   comprised only 15 ECM species and the high-severity treeless ground fire
   area 23 species. Assemblage composition (based on NMDS) was different in
   the two most severely burned areas, in comparison to less severely
   burned areas and controls.
   We conclude that fire affects ECM assemblages and that the severity of a
   wildfire is connected to post-fire patterns of ECM richness and
   composition. The results suggest a functional link between wildfire and
   post-fire tree growth, mediated through the effects of fire on ECM.
   These connections may be important in maintaining small-scale,
   within-stand spatial heterogeneity in the natural post-disturbance
   forests.}},

   burned the 48-month FMU and, after approximately 8 weeks, repeated the
   camera-trap surveys in the newly burned (<6-month) FMU and the adjacent
   FMU, now at approximately 30-months post-fire recovery. We documented a
   significant increase in use of the recently burned (<6-month) FMU
   compared to previous levels of use (48-month FMU) by total wildlife (P =
   0.04) and white-tailed deer (P = 0.02). Use of the <6-month FMU by wild
   turkey also appeared to increase P = 0.13). No difference was detected
   between the <6-month and the adjacent 30-month FMU in use by total
   wildlife P = 0.52), white-tailed deer (P = 0.43), Florida panther
   (P=0.23), or wild turkey P = 0.14), although data suggested that wild
   turkey may have preferred the newly burned area. More importantly, our
   data suggested that wildlife did not avoid pine flatwoods habitat at up
   to 30-month post-fire recovery. Wildlife use of pine flatwoods habitat,
   therefore, was observed to increase in areas recently burned (<6 months
   post-fire), was similar between FMUs with post-fire recovery of <6 and
   up to 30 months, and was lowest in habitat that had not been burned for
   48 months. Maintaining a prescribed-fire rotation of less than or equal
   to48 months, therefore, appears to improve habitat quality of pine
   flatwoods for white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and other wildlife in
   southwest Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and land-use activities are increasing fire activity
   across much of the Siberian boreal forest, yet the climate feedbacks
   from forest disturbances remain difficult to quantify due to limited
   information on forest biomass distribution, disturbance regimes and
   post-disturbance ecosystem recovery. Our primary objective here was to
   analyse post-fire accumulation of Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.)
   aboveground biomass for a 100 000 km(2) area of open forest in far
   northeastern Siberia. In addition to examining effects of fire size and
   topography on post-fire larch aboveground biomass, we assessed regional
   fire rotation and density, as well as performance of burned area maps
   generated from MODIS satellite imagery. Using Landsat imagery, we mapped
   116 fire scar perimeters that dated c. 1966-2007. We then mapped larch
   aboveground biomass by linking field biomass measurements to tree
   shadows mapped synergistically from WorldView-1 and Landsat 5 satellite
   imagery. Larch aboveground biomass tended to be low during early
   succession (<= 25 yr, 271+/-26 gm(-2), n = 66 {[}mean+/-SE]) and
   decreased with increasing elevation and northwardly aspect. Larch
   aboveground biomass tended to be higher during mid-succession (33-38 yr,
   746+/-100 gm(-2), n = 32), though was highly variable. The high
   variability was not associated with topography and potentially reflected
   differences in post-fire density of tree regrowth. Neither fire size nor
   latitude were significant predictors of post-fire larch aboveground
   biomass. Fire activity was considerably higher in the Kolyma Mountains
   (fire rotation = 110 yr, fire density = 1.0+/-1.0 fires yr(-1) x 10(4)
   km(-2)) than along the forest-tundra border (fire rotation = 792 yr,
   fire density = 0.3+/-0.3 fires yr(-1) x 10(4) km(-2)). The MODIS burned
   area maps underestimated the total area burned in this region from
   2000-2007 by 40\%. Tree shadows mapped jointly using high and medium
   resolution satellite imagery were strongly associated (r(2) approximate
   to 0.9) with field measurements of forest structure, which permitted
   spatial extrapolation of aboveground biomass to a regional extent.
   Better understanding of forest biomass distribution, disturbances and
   post-disturbance recovery is needed to improve predictions of the net
   climatic feedbacks associated with landscape-scale forest disturbances
   in northern Eurasia.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The 2002 Hayman Fire burned with mixed-severity across a 400-ha dry
   conifer study site in Colorado, USA, where overstory tree and surface
   cover attributes had been recently measured on 20 0.1-ha permanent
   plots. We remeasured these plots repeatedly during the first post-fire
   decade to examine how the attributes changed through time and whether
   changes were influenced by fire severity. We found that most attributes
   were temporally dynamic and that fire severity shaped their dynamics.
   For example, low-severity plots experienced a modest reduction in live
   overstory density due to both immediate and delayed tree mortality, and
   no change in live overstory basal area through time; in contrast,
   high-severity plots experienced an immediate and total loss of live
   overstory density and basal area. Large snag density in low-severity
   plots did not vary temporally because snag recruitment balanced snag
   loss; however, in high-severity plots large snag density increased
   markedly immediately post-fire and then declined by about half by
   post-fire year ten as snags fell. Mineral soil cover increased modestly
   immediately post-fire in low-severity plots and substantially
   immediately post-fire in high-severity plots, but changed little in
   ensuing years for either severity class. By incorporating pre-fire and
   repeatedly-measured post-fire data for a range of severities, our study
   uniquely contributes to the current understanding of wildfire effects in
   dry conifer forests and should be of interest to managers, researchers,
   and others.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, wildfires are considered an integral part of forest dynamics
   mainly in the Mediterranean region and Fenno-Scandinavia. In temperate
   forests of Central Europe, by contrast, the ecological role of fire has
   largely been neglected even though the high frequency of wildfires in
   naturally fire-prone forests is well documented. In this study, we
   focused on semi-natural forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris in Central
   European sandstone regions that resemble boreo-continental pine forests,
   which are claimed to be fire-adapted. We studied the ability of these
   forests to recover spontaneously after a fire event. Specifically, we
   observed the development of vegetation composition and diversity, the
   role of fire severity and the ability of tree species to resist fire,
   and asked whether wildfires can contribute to the preservation of
   pine-dominated forests in the region.
   Our study takes a space-for-time substitution approach based on a
   quantitative analysis of vegetation data collected in spontaneously
   regenerating burnt forest plots of post-fire age ranging from 1 to 192
   years. This time span allowed us to reveal the complete successional
   trajectory and to assess how resistant or resilient the forests are to
   fire in respect of severity of damage and time needed to return to the
   pre-fire state.
   The resistance of the tree layer turned out to be dependent on species
   composition and fire severity. The forest understorey, by contrast,
   could not resist fires even of low-severity. All study stands displayed
   structural and compositional resilience, resulting in fast recovery of
   the vegetation cover in all stand layers and return to a similar species
   composition as in pre-fire stands after about 140 years. However, the
   species richness remained increased up to the latest successional stage
   in comparison with mature non-post-fire forest stands. In early
   post-fire phases, broad-leaved pioneer species and Pinus sylvestris
   regeneration prevailed, but during stand development, there was a
   continuous shift towards stands with higher proportional abundance of
   more shade-tolerant and fire-sensitive tree species. Periodic wildfires
   occurring at least once in 200 years thus seem to be a factor
   maintaining forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris in temperate sandstone
   landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Question
   How do understorey plant communities of Pinus ponderosa-Pseudotsuga
   menziesii forests respond during the first 5yrs following wildfire, and
   do responses vary with fire severity?
   Location
   Colorado Front Range, USA.
   Methods
   In 2002, the Hayman Fire burned across 55800ha of Colorado Front Range
   P.ponderosa-P.menziesii forest. Also burned in the fire were 20 upland
   and five riparian plots within a 400-ha study area. These plots had been
   surveyed for understorey plant composition and cover 5-6yrs prior. We
   re-measured all plots annually from 2003 to 2007, 1-5yrs post-fire.
   Changes in the occurrence of common understorey plant species and in
   metrics of understorey plant richness and cover were analysed with
   regard to fire severity and time since fire using repeated measures
   ANOVA. Compositional changes were explored using ordination.
   Results
   Fire severity (defined in terms of overstorey mortality, overstorey
   canopy consumption, and forest floor consumption) in upland plots was
   highly variable, with 50\%, 30\% and 20\% of plots burning with low,
   moderate and high severity, respectively. For all severities, total
   cover in uplands declined in the first post-fire year relative to
   pre-fire levels, but met or exceeded pre-fire levels by post-fire year
   five. Total richness in uplands, however, did not similarly decline
   immediately following fire, due largely to a high return rate of
   pre-fire species, and exceeded pre-fire levels for all severities from
   post-fire years 3-5 due to new species recruitment. Over 90\% of the
   common upland species either were found in a similar number of plots
   before and after the fire, regardless of fire severity or time since
   fire, or were found in more plots following the fire in at least 1yr and
   one severity class. Temporal changes in upland composition occurred for
   all severities but were most pronounced following moderate and severe
   fire. In contrast, riparian plots largely burned with low severity, and
   the understorey plant communities within them exhibited little change in
   richness, cover and composition over the 5yrs.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that the Hayman Fire had largely neutral or
   stimulatory impacts on understorey plant communities following the first
   five post-fire years.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses the effect of successional stage after farmland
   terrace abandonment on post-fire plant recovery in a Mediterranean
   landscape. Specific objectives of the study were to (1) compare fuel
   characteristics and fire severity in three successional stages after
   farmland abandonment - dry grassland, dense shrubland and pine stands;
   (2) analyse the effect of pre-fire successional stage and fire severity
   on vegetation recovery and (3) analyse the relative vulnerability (i.e.
   potential for ecosystem shift and soil degradation) to wildfires of the
   successional stages. We assessed 30 abandoned terraces (15 unburned and
   15 burned), with diverse successional stages, on the Xorta Range
   (south-east Spain). Post-fire recovery was measured 1, 4 and 7 years
   after fire. The successional stages varied in aboveground biomass,
   litter amount, vertical structure and continuity of plant cover, and
   flammability. Dry grassland showed the lowest fire severity, whereas no
   differences in severity were found between shrubland and pine stands.
   One year after fire, plant cover was inversely related to fire severity;
   this relationship attenuated with time after fire. Post-fire recovery of
   pine stands and shrubland led in both cases to shrublands, contributing
   to landscape homogenisation. The pine stands showed the largest changes
   in composition due to fire and the lowest post-fire plant recovery - a

Abstract = {{Half of a 400-year-old forest in northeastern Minnesota, USA, burned in
   autumn 2006 providing a unique opportunity to examine stability and
   response to stand-replacing fire in a region where the historic mean
   fire return interval was about 100 y. We installed 18 permanent 50-m
   transects in 1977 and 18 more in 1997. In 2008, 18 additional transects
   were surveyed along with the initial transects; half were in the burned
   portion of the forest and half remained unburned. In 2010 and 2014, all
   transects were again inventoried. Before the fire, eastern white pine
   (Pinus strobus), historically the dominant tree, represented less than
   4\% of the canopy in which northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis),
   balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) had
   become dominants. In 37 y of observation, few significant changes
   occurred in the unburned forest. In the burned forest, however, the
   intense fire killed virtually all trees on the upland, and reduced tree
   cover from near 90\% to just over 10\%, with survival primarily in wet
   draws. There was no nearby seed source for jack pine (Pinus banksiana)
   or quaking (Populus tremuloides) or big-toothed (P. grandidentata)
   aspen, the most frequent post-fire pioneers. Seedlings of aspen and
   paper birch established dominance in the small-tree layer within eight
   years, and dense white cedar established in mesic microsites near
   surviving seed sources. Stand-level diversity of vegetation after the
   fire was about the same as before the fire, but primarily as a result of
   species that survived in wet draws. Raspberry (Rubus idaeus), fire-weed
   (Epilobium angustifolium), and several sedges (Carex spp.) became
   temporarily abundant, peaking six years after fire. There was no
   post-fire white pine regeneration. Results indicate that in the
   long-term absence of fire there was a gradual shift in canopy
   composition with relatively little corresponding change in the
   understory. Results also underscore the importance of microsites in
   buffering change and driving landscape scale diversity, and how a shift
   in fire regime can initiate a different successional trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Fires can heavily impact forest ecosystems but fire consequences for
   animal communities at burned and control sites are rarely investigated
   in natural forests. Here we present a 10-year study of post-fire beetle
   succession in natural ecosystem of Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland,
   being a hotspot for beetle fauna. We sampled beetles at burned and
   unburned (control) sites and compared local alpha and regional gamma
   diversity between treatments and over time. In total, 27,958 individuals
   belonging to 630 beetle species were recorded. Average species richness
   (alpha diversity) and density per sample was higher in burned forest
   than in control sites, and this difference was especially strong in case
   of all species pooled and pyrophilous species, but a reverse tendency
   was observed in case of rare beetles. These differences between
   treatments, however, were disappearing over time since fire. Similarly,
   beetle . communities occurring in burned and control sites were becoming
   more similar over time elapsed since fire. Gamma diversity (i.e. pooled
   regional species richness) was distinctly higher at burned sites
   compared to unburned, and the pattern was confirmed for all species,
   rare species and pyrophilous species. We conclude, that fire increases
   both alpha and gamma diversity of beetle community in natural forest and
   burned temperate forests left without intervention may host a rich
   beetle community. We propose, therefore, post-fire management should
   take these findings into account and consider prescribed burning as a
   conservation measure in Central European forests.}},

Abstract = {{Fire occurrence in Mediterranean landscapes has been studied widely.
   Despite this, a specific monitoring of vegetation recovery after

   and multi-temporal Landsat images of the area of Ayora (287 700 ha) in
   Valencia (Eastern Spain), between the years 1984 and 1999, we studied
   the post-fire regeneration of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) in areas subjected to different fire recurrences. Emphasis is
   given to the effect of time since fire, precipitation, and bedrock types
   on post-fire NDVI changes. Results suggest that for the first 7 years
   after a single fire, NDVI depends mainly on the time since fire
   (post-fire regeneration), whereas environmental parameters
   (precipitation and bedrock type) are of little relevance. After this
   period, precipitation begins to have a direct influence on the NDVI. In
   patches burned twice, with fire intervals of 8 and 9 years, NDVI is also
   controlled by the time since fire. Furthermore, NDVI recovery is faster
   after the first fire than after the second fire, suggesting that fire
   recurrence has a negative impact on the resilience of these communities.
   Bedrock type did not show any effect on NDVI after fire. These findings
   contribute to the understanding of Mediterranean landscape dynamics and
   provide evidence for the usefulness of NDVI in post-fire regeneration
   assessment, and the possible negative effects of the increasing fire

Abstract = {{In 1987, a catastrophic fire burned over 1 330 000 ha in the densely
   forested area of the Da Hinggan Mountains in the northeastern China.
   After the fire, intensive management including burned trunk harvesting
   and coniferous tree planting had been conducted to accelerate forest
   restoration. To study the long term effect of these activities on forest
   recovery, we used a simulation modeling approach to study long-term (300
   years) forest dynamics under current planting and natural regeneration
   scenarios. Results indicate that under tree planting scenario in the
   severely burned area, the dominant species Dahurian larch (Larix
   gmelinii) can reach pre-fire level (60\% of the area) within 20 years
   and the maximum abundance can reach nearly 90\% within 100 years. While
   under natural regeneration scenario, it needs about 250 years to reach
   its pre-fire level. From the perspective of timber production, tree
   planting can bring twice as much timber volume as that under natural
   regeneration within 300 years, which is the average longevity of L.
   gmelinii. It needs about 70 years to reach the timber volume of pre-fire
   level under the planting scenario, whereas it requires at least 250
   years to reach the timber volume of pre-fire level under natural
   regeneration scenario. Another dominant species Asian White birch
   (Betula platyphylla) responded negatively to the planting of coniferous
   species. In general, tree planting of coniferous species after fire can
   greatly accelerate forest restoration in terms of species abundance and

Abstract = {{Forest fires are increasing in size and severity globally, yet the roles
   of natural and artificial regeneration in promoting forest recovery are
   poorly understood. Post-fire regeneration of ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa, Lawson and C. Lawson) in the southwestern U.S. is slow,
   episodic, and difficult to predict. Planting of ponderosa pine after
   wildfire may accelerate reforestation, but little is known about
   survival of plantings and the amount of post-fire natural regeneration.
   We compared ponderosa pine regeneration between paired planted and
   unplanted plots at eight sites in Arizona and New Mexico that recently
   (2002-2005) burned severely. Two sites had no natural regeneration and
   no survival of planted seedlings. Seedling presence increased with
   number of years since burning across all plots, was positively
   associated with forb and litter cover on planted plots, and was
   positively associated with litter cover on unplanted plots. Survival of
   planted seedlings, measured five to eight years after planting, averaged
   25\% (SE = 8) and varied from 0\% to 70\% across sites resulting in
   seedling densities of 0-521 trees ha(-1). Based on a projected 44\%
   survival of seedlings to mature trees and target density of mature trees
   determined by historical range of variability and ecological restoration
   principles, four of eight sites have a seedling density in planted plots
   (125-240 ha(-1)) that will produce a density of mature trees (55-106
   ha(-1)) close to desired levels, whereas seedlings are currently
   deficient at three planted sites, and in surplus at one site, which had
   abundant natural regeneration. Natural regeneration in unplanted plots
   during the first decade after burning produced seedling densities
   inconsistent with desired numbers of mature trees. Natural regeneration
   in unplanted plots produced less than 33 seedlings ha-1 at seven of
   eight sites, but produced 1433 seedlings ha-1 at one high-elevation site
   that supported a more mesic vegetation community before burning than the
   other sites. Our results show that current practices for planting
   ponderosa pine after severe fires in Arizona and New Mexico produce
   desired numbers of seedlings in approximately half of all projects,
   whereas natural regeneration rarely does within the first decade after
   burning. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological processes within forests provide vital ecosystem services to
   society, most of which depend on the persistence of tree cover that can
   be altered after the impact of a disturbance. The aim of the present
   study was to examine the role of seed dispersal and resprouting that
   mediate resilience to large fires and evaluate the economic costs that
   these ecological functions provide. We used field data from 412 plots of
   the Spanish National Forest Inventory providing information on pre- and
   post-fire conditions of Mediterranean Pinus spp. and Quercus
   spp.-dominated forests. Then, we determined the need for restoration (N
   (Rest)) and estimated the minimum pre-fire densities needed to ensure
   adequate post-fire cover. Economic valuations were assessed through
   three different scenarios (Sc) of possible human-management actions
   aimed at ensuring proper post-fire tree cover: Sc. 1) a pre-fire
   management scenario evaluating the costs of planting Quercus spp.
   seedlings in the understory, mimicking the whole dispersal function; Sc.
   2) a pre-fire scenario in which enrichment plantations increased the
   densities of natural oaks; and Sc. 3) a post-fire scenario where the
   restoration is done through planting pines within the burned area.
   Approximately 90\% of the burned area (371 out of 412 plots) was able to
   recover after fire supporting the view that Mediterranean forests are
   resilient to fire. This resilience was primarily mediated by biotic seed
   dispersal and posterior resprouting of tree species. These ecological
   functions saved between 626 and 1,326 a,not sign/ha compared to the
   human-management actions. Ensuring key ecological processes within
   forests increases forest resilience and recovery after fire leading to a
   generally significant saving of economic resources. In a perspective of
   increased future impact of disturbances and decrease availability of
   economic resources for forest management, the implications of the
   present study can be far reaching and extended to other forest planning
   exercises.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1842-1853}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Most models project warmer and drier climates that will contribute to
   larger and more frequent wildfires. However, it remains unknown how
   repeated wildfires alter post-fire successional patterns and forest
   structure. Here, we test the hypothesis that the number of wildfires, as
   well as the order and severity of wildfire events interact to alter
   forest structure and vegetation recovery and implications for vegetation
   management. In 2014, we examined forest structure, composition, and tree
   regeneration in stands that burned 1-18 yr before a subsequent 2007
   wildfire. Three important findings emerged: (1) Repeatedly burned
   forests had 15\% less woody surface fuels and 31\% lower tree seedling
   densities compared with forests that only experienced one recent
   wildfire. These repeatedly burned areas are recovering differently than
   sites burned once, which may lead to alternative ecosystem structure.
   (2) Order of burn severity (high followed by low severity compared with
   low followed by high severity) did influence forest characteristics.
   When low burn severity followed high, forests had 60\% lower canopy
   closure and total basal area with 92\% fewer tree seedlings than when
   high burn severity followed low. (3) Time between fires had no effect on
   most variables measured following the second fire except large woody
   fuels, canopy closure and tree seedling density. We conclude that
   repeatedly burned areas meet many vegetation management objectives of
   reduced fuel loads and moderate tree seedling densities. These
   differences in forest structure, composition, and tree regeneration have
   implications not only for the trajectories of these forests, but may
   reduce fire intensity and burn severity of subsequent wildfires and may
   be used in conjunction with future fire suppression tactics.}},

   Change}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: Big environmental disturbances have big ecological effects,
   yet these are not always what we might expect. Understanding the
   proximate effects of major disturbances, such as severe wildfires, on
   individuals, populations and habitats will be essential for
   understanding how predicted future increases in the frequency of such
   disturbances will affect ecosystems. However, researchers rarely have
   access to data from immediately before and after such events. Here we
   report on the effects of a severe and extensive forest wildfire on
   mortality, reproductive output and availability of key shelter resources
   for an arboreal marsupial. We also investigated the behavioural response
   of individuals to changed shelter resource availability in the post-fire
   environment.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We fitted proximity-logging
   radiotransmitters to mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus
   cunninghami) before, during and after the 2009 wildfires in Victoria,
   Australia. Surprisingly, we detected no mortality associated with the
   fire, and despite a significant post-fire decrease in the proportion of
   females carrying pouch young in the burnt area, there was no short-term
   post-fire population decline. The major consequence of this fire for
   mountain brushtail possums was the loss of over 80\% of hollow-bearing
   trees. The types of trees preferred as shelter sites (highly decayed
   dead standing trees) were those most likely to collapse after fire.
   Individuals adapted to resource decline by being more flexible in
   resource selection after the fire, but not by increased resource
   sharing.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite short-term demographic resilience and
   behavioural adaptation following this fire, the major loss of decayed
   hollow trees suggests the increased frequency of stand-replacing
   wildfires predicted under climate change will pose major challenges for
   shelter resource availability for hollow-dependent fauna. Hollow-bearing
   trees are typically biological legacies of previous forest generations
   in post-fire regrowth forests but will cease to be recruited to future
   regrowth forests if the interval between severe fires becomes too rapid
   for hollow formation.}},

Abstract = {{Cordilleran cypress (Austrocedrus chilensis {[}D.Don] Pic. Serm. et
   Bizarri) forests occupy 140,000 ha along a sharp environmental gradient
   of central Andean-Patagonia in Argentina. Every summer, about 3200 ha of
   these forests are affected by wildfires, taking thereafter long time to
   recover. To accelerate forest recovery, we determined in xeric and mesic
   cypress stands burned 5 and 2 year before whether survival and growth of
   two planted cypress seedling stocktypes are affected by plant cover and
   contrasting precipitation conditions. Two experiments were conducted on
   each site, involving 100 replicates of two seedling stocktypes, having
   each significantly different morphological attributes. The experiments
   comprised a dry and humid growing season on each site. Both stocktypes
   performed similarly within stands, but differently between stands. In
   the xeric stand, plant cover had neutral effects on seedling survival,
   favored seedling height growth in the dry season, and was negative on
   collar diameter and stem growth. In the mesic site, high plant cover
   favored survival and height growth, but was inconsequential for collar
   diameter and stem growth. In this short-term post-fire period, and
   independent of precipitation received during both seasons (dry or
   humid), plant cover appears as playing a facilitative role, having
   neutral or even positive effects on survival and growth of planted
   seedlings. During the early post-fire successional stages, and besides
   seedling stocktype, there was a synergistic balance between light and
   soil moisture that seems to benefit planted seedling performance in
   burned cypress forests, and especially in mesic sites.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzed the state of recovery of the vegetation burnt in the
   National Park of Torres del Paine by the Olguin fire between December,
   2011 and March, 2012. To do this, pre- and post-fire NDVI images were
   created from a time series of 24 Landsat images (acquired between April,
   2009 and 2015). The dynamic of the vegetation recovery was examined by
   comparing the NDVI values across the time series. The biomass variation
   of the burnt vegetation was mapped by classifying and comparing pre- and
   post-fire NDVI images acquired in the same month (October 2009 and
   2014). The results indicate that most of the vegetation of the study
   area (58.61\%), corresponding to pre-Andean scrubs, diminished its
   biomass levels for study period. The pre- and post-fire NDVI class
   crossing by a confusion matrix showed that the highest and most
   prevailing pre- fire NDVI classes, mostly corresponding to hydromorphic
   forests and Andean scrubs, turned into the lowest classes in 2014. The
   remaining area, comprising Patagonian steppe, reestablished its biomass
   levels in 2014, mostly exhibiting the same pre-fire NDVI classes. These
   results may provide guidelines to monitor and manage the regeneration of
   the vegetation impacted by this fire.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers indicators of the dynamics of plant communities with
   Paeonia tenuifolia before and after fire impact. Studies were conducted
   in the Khvalynsky National Park (forest-steppe zone of Russia) in
   2008-2018. The authors conducted a complex study in burned and unburned
   plant communities. An assessment of the effects of fire impact and the
   development of a post-fire action plan were considered in the Protected
   Area. The plant community Paeonia tenuifolia + Calamagrostis epigejos +
   Adonis vernalis - Potentilla volgarica burned down in 2009. The plant
   community Paeonia tenuifolia + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis - Anemone
   sylvestris was unburned. To characterise plant communities with Paeonia
   tenuifolia and its coenopopulations, we used standard geobotanical
   description methods. Sixty seven vascular plant species were part of the
   post-fire phytocoenosis. Of them, 14 species are included in the Red
   Data Book of the Saratov region. Changes in the post-fire plant
   community have occurred in the following order: 1) Paeonia tenuifolia +
   Calamagrostis epigejos + Adonis vernalis - Stipa pennata (in 2008) -> 2)
   Paeonia tenuifolia + Elymus repens + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis +
   Thalictrum simplex (in 2010) -> 3) Paeonia tenuifolia - Stipa pennata -
   Calamagrostis epigejos + Festuca valesiaca + Phleum pratense + Poa
   bulbosa + Prunus tenella (in 2011) -> 4) Paeonia tenuifolia + Adonis
   vernalis + Stipa pennata (in 2015, 2017, 2018). After the fire influence
   on a plant community, the following changes took place: 1) annuals and
   ruderal plant species appeared and increased their abundance; 2) the
   ratio of dominant species has changed. In 2012-2018, the phytocenotic
   role of Calamagrostis epigejos decreased, while the coverage and
   abundance of Stipa pennata increased at the same period. The abundance
   dynamics of Paeonia tenuifolia decreased in 2010, while in 2015-2018,
   its value gradually increased. The species richness of the
   post-pyrogenic plant community varied from 20 species in the first
   post-fire year to 38 species in the last study year. In the first
   post-fire year, the families Poaceae (six species), Leguminosae plants
   (three species), Rosaceae plants (three species) occupied the leading
   positions. During the post-pyrogenic succession, the dominant position
   of the listed families was not changing. Species of Compositae, Poaceae,
   Ranunculaceae families prevailed in the unburned plant community. Steppe
   plants dominated in the post-fire plant community: Stipa pennata, Adonis
   vernalis, and Paeonia tenuifolia. The leading ecologic-coenotic groups
   were steppe plants (70\%), meadow plants (16\%), forest plants (5\%),
   and ruderal plants (9\%). Weed-steppe plants were indicators of habitat
   disturbance by human activities. Among weed-steppe plants, there were
   Arenaria serpyllifolia, Viola rupestris, Erysimum canescens, Verbascum
   lychnitis. Gradient analysis of environmental conditions showed that the
   highest value of the vitality index (IVC = 1.15) corresponds to the best
   conditions for the growth and survival of the Paeonia tenuifolia
   population in the post-fire community. In the control site, the vitality
   index (IVC = 0.85) corresponded to unfavourable conditions for plant
   development. We studied the age spectra of the natural Paeonia
   tenuifolia populations in the burned and unburned communities. We showed
   that both populations were normal, complete, and young. The fire-damaged
   populations were younger than the populations in the unburned
   communities.
   We suggest the need of comprehensive monitoring studies to properly
   assess the fire effects and subsequent management actions for the
   vegetation restoration after fire influence.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Disturbances can interrupt feedbacks that maintain stable plant
   community structure and create windows of opportunity for vegetation to
   shift to alternative states. Boreal forests are dominated by tree
   species that overlap considerably in environmental niche, but there are
   few tests of what conditions initiate and sustain different forest
   states. Here, we examine patterns of post-fire growth and density of
   tree seedlings in early succession and use structural equation models to
   estimate relative effects of environmental and pre-fire conditions, fire
   characteristics, and biotic interactions. We surveyed tree seedling
   recruits for 13 yr across a broad range of environmental and fire
   conditions (n = 89) in Alaskan black spruce stands that burned in 2004.
   Densities of established seedlings at 13 yr were strongly determined by
   initial recruitment that occurred within 2 yr after fire. High
   proportional combustion of the soil organic layer (fire severity) led to
   increased densities of deciduous seedlings but not of black spruce and
   had a positive influence on aboveground biomass of all species. Biotic
   interactions such as mammalian herbivory or woody competition, potential
   mechanisms for relay floristic succession, had no detectable effects on
   tree seedling densities or biomass. Repeated surveys instead suggested
   persistent shifts in successional trajectories of tree communities from
   spruce to deciduous dominance at sites where high fire severity created
   positive conditions for deciduous seedling recruitment and growth.
   Unless future species interactions alter the deciduous dominance of tree
   seedling composition, the vegetation transformations that we observed in
   response to high fire severity are likely to persist over the short fire
   cycle that increasingly characterizes the fire regime of Interior
   Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important ecological factor that influences the distribution
   and abundance of plant populations of shrub species in fire-prone
   habitats. Comprehensive information about the fire-response syndromes
   and post-fire recruitment of seedlings in tableland habitats of eastern
   Australia is poorly known. In particular, data on shrubs occurring in
   grassy habitats are lacking for temperate regions of Australia. The
   post-fire response and recruitment patterns of shrub taxa were recorded
   from research burns and wildfires on the New England Tablelands over 4
   years in the following four habitats: grassy woodlands and open forests,
   shrubby open forests, wet heaths and rocky outcrops. The ratio of
   obligate seeder to resprouter species differed among habitats, with the
   highest ratio occurring on rocky outcrops (90:10) and the lowest in
   grassy forests (19:81). Post-fire recruitment of seedlings was also
   highest on rocky outcrops whereas seedlings were rarely observed in the
   wet heaths and grassy forests. The following six models that explain
   these patterns were reviewed: fire and grazing frequency, soil nutrients
   and texture, habitat openness and environmental variability. No one
   model could uniformly explain differences in fire response across all
   habitats but a combination of disturbance-frequency and
   regeneration-niche models may provide a mechanism for the patterns
   observed. Field and laboratory experiments are needed to examine
   allocation to persistence (resprouting) and reproduction in species with
   different fire-response syndromes. These experiments also need to

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{352-372}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Natural fires ignited by lightning strikes following droughts frequently
   are posited as the ecological mechanism maintaining discontinuous tree
   cover and grass-dominated ground layers in savannas. Such fires,
   however, may not reliably maintain humid savannas. We propose that
   savanna trees producing pyrogenic shed leaves might engineer fire
   characteristics, affecting ground-layer plants in ways that maintain
   humid savannas. We explored our hypothesis in a high-rainfall,
   frequently burned pine savanna in which the dominant tree, long-leaf
   pine (Pinus palustris), produces resinous needles that become highly
   flammable when shed and dried. We postulated that pyrogenic needles
   should have much greater influence on fire characteristics at ground
   level, and hence post-fire responses of dominant shrubs and grasses,
   than other abundant fine fuels (shed oak leaves and grass culms). We
   further reasoned that these effects should increase with amounts of
   needles. We managed site conditions that affect fuels (time since fire,
   dominant vegetation), manipulated amounts of needles in ground-layer
   plots, prescribed burned the plots, and measured fire characteristics at
   ground level. We also measured characteristics of ground-layer oaks and
   grasses before, then 2 and 8 months after fires. We tested our
   hypotheses regarding effects of pyrogenic pine fuels on fire
   characteristics and vegetation regrowth and explored direct and indirect
   effects of fuels on fire characteristics and vegetation using a
   structural equation model. Pine needles influenced fire characteristics,
   elevating maximum temperature increases, durations of heating above 60
   degrees C, and fine fuel consumption considerably above measurements
   when fuels only included other savanna plants. Presence of pine needles
   depressed post-fire numbers of oak stems and grass culms, especially in
   the interior of grass genets, as well as post-fire flowering of grasses.
   The structural equation model indicated strong direct and indirect
   pathways from pine needles to post-fire responses of oaks and grasses.
   The experimental field tests of hypotheses, bolstered by structural
   equation modeling, indicate pyrogenic fine fuels modify characteristics

Abstract = {{Many naturalized populations of the invasive tree princess tree exist in
   North America, yet little research has quantified its effect on native
   plant communities. A series of recent wildfires in the Linville Gorge
   Wilderness Area (LGWA) promoted multiple large-scale princess tree
   invasions in this ecologically important area. To measure community
   shifts caused by these princess tree invasions across burn areas, we
   sampled vegetation in paired invaded and noninvaded plots in mature and
   immature invasions within two burn areas of the LGWA. Plant community
   composition shifted in response to princess tree invasion across all
   invasion stages and burn areas. Species richness and Shannon diversity
   values decreased in invaded plots. Overall community structure also
   differed in invaded plots within immature invasions (P = 0.004). The
   distribution of princess tree age classes in both burn areas indicates
   that fire promotes invasion but is not necessary for subsequent
   recruitment. Additionally, preliminary genetic analyses among distinct
   princess tree populations revealed very low genetic diversity,
   suggesting that a single introduction may have occurred in the LGWA.
   This information regarding community shift and strong post-fire
   recruitment by princess tree may inform management decisions by
   prioritizing princess tree control immediately after wildfires and
   immediately before and after prescribed burns.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to analyze the relationship between fire regime attributes and
   the post-fire greenness recovery of fire-prone pine ecosystems over the
   short (2-year) and medium (5-year) term after a large wildfire, using
   both a single and a combined fire regime attribute approach. We
   characterized the spatial (fire size), temporal (number of fires, fire
   recurrence, and return interval), and magnitude (burn severity of the
   last fire) fire regime attributes throughout a 40-year period with a
   long-time series of Landsat imagery and ancillary data. The burn
   severity of the last fire was measured by the dNBR (difference of the
   Normalized Burn Ratio) spectral index, and classified according to the
   ground reference values of the CBI (Composite Burn Index). Post-fire
   greenness recovery was obtained through the difference of the NDVI
   (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) between pre- and post-fire
   Landsat scenes. The relationship between fire regime attributes (single
   attributes: fire recurrence, fire return interval, and burn severity;
   combined attributes: fire recurrence-burn severity and fire return
   interval-burn severity) and post-fire greenness recovery was evaluated
   using linear models. The results indicated that all the single and
   combined attributes significantly affected greenness recovery. The
   single attribute approach showed that high recurrence, short return
   interval and low severity situations had the highest vegetation
   greenness recovery. The combined attribute approach allowed us to
   identify a wider variety of post-fire greenness recovery situations than
   the single attribute one. Over the short term, high recurrence as well
   as short return interval scenarios showed the best post-fire greenness
   recovery independently of burn severity, while over the medium term,
   high recurrence combined with low severity was the most recovered
   scenario. This novel combined attribute approach (temporal plus
   magnitude) could be of great value to forest managers in the development
   of post-fire restoration strategies to promote vegetation recovery in
   fire-prone pine ecosystems in the Mediterranean Basin under complex fire
   regime scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the transferability between fire recurrence scenarios of
   post-fire vegetation cover models calibrated with satellite imagery data
   at different spatial resolutions within two Mediterranean pine forest
   sites affected by large wildfires in 2012. Location The northwest and
   east of the Iberian Peninsula. Methods In each study site, we defined
   three fire recurrence scenarios for a reference period of 35 years. We
   used image texture derived from the surface reflectance channels of
   WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 (at a spatial resolution of 2 m x 2 m and 20
   m x 20 m, respectively) as predictors of post-fire vegetation cover in
   Random Forest regression analysies. Percentage vegetation cover was
   sampled in two sets of field plots with a size roughly equivalent to the
   spatial resolution of the imagery. The plots were distributed following
   a stratified design according to fire recurrence scenarios. Model
   transferability was assessed within each study site by applying the
   vegetation cover model developed for a given fire recurrence scenario to
   predict vegetation cover in other scenarios, iteratively. Results For
   both wildfires, the highest model transferability between fire
   recurrence scenarios was achieved for those holding the most similar
   vegetation community composition regarding the balance of species
   abundance according to their plant-regenerative traits (root mean square
   error {[}RMSE] around or lower than 15\%). Model transferability
   performance was highly improved by fine-grained remote-sensing data.
   Conclusions Fire recurrence is a major driver of community structure and

Abstract = {{Riparian habitats are highly important ecosystems for tropical
   biodiversity, and highly threatened ecosystems through changing
   disturbance regimes and weed invasion. An experimental study was
   conducted to assess the ecosystem impacts of fire regimes introduced for
   the removal of the exotic woody vine, Cryptostegia grandiflora, in
   tropical north-eastern Australian woodlands. Experimental sites in
   subcatchments of the Burdekin River, northern Queensland, Australia,
   were subjected to combinations of early wet-season and dry-season fires,
   and single and repeated fires, with an unburnt control. Woody vegetation
   was sampled using permanent quadrats to record and monitor plants
   species, number and size-class. Sampling was conducted pre-fire in 1999
   and post-fire in 2002. All fire regimes were effective in reducing the
   number and biomass of C. grandiflora shrubs and vines. Few woodland or
   riparian species were found to be fire-sensitive and community
   composition did not change markedly under any fire regime. The more
   intense dry-season fires impacted the structure of non-target
   vegetation, with large reductions in the number of sapling trees (< 5 cm
   d.b.h.) and reductions in the largest tree size-class and total tree
   basal area. Unexpectedly, medium-sized canopy trees (10-30 cm d.b.h.)
   appear to have been significantly benefited by fires, with decreases in
   number of trees of this size-class in the absence of fire. Although the
   presence of C. grandiflora as a vine in riparian forest canopies changed
   the nature and intensity of crown combustion patterns, this did not lead
   to the initiation of a self-perpetuating weed-fire cycle, as invaders
   were unable to take advantage of gaps caused by fire. Low intensity,
   early wet-season burning, or early dry-season burning, is recommended
   for control of C. grandiflora in order to minimize the fire intensity
   and risk of the loss of large habitat trees in riparian habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Warm/dry mixed conifer forests have undergone changes in disturbance
   regimes, forest structure, species composition, and surface fuel
   accumulation which have led to increased susceptibility to large,
   uncharacteristically severe wildfires and pathogenic outbreaks.
   Ecosystems resilient to fire events return to a similar set of
   structures (e.g., forest and understory composition and density) or
   processes (e.g., fire, decomposition rates); however, when exposed to
   disturbances outside the evolutionary envelope, may transition to a
   different state (e.g., type conversion). We sampled warm/dry mixed
   conifer forest stands treated prior to the 2011 Wallow Fire and paired
   untreated sites five years following the fire. Our objective was to
   evaluate mid-term ecosystem resiliency in terms of forest structure,
   bark beetle activity, and tree regeneration. We hypothesized that
   treated units would have higher mid-term post-fire resiliency compared
   to untreated units. In 2016, average total tree density remained
   significantly lower in treated compared to paired untreated units;
   conifer density and BA decreased in both treated and untreated units.
   Diameter distributions in 2016 treated units remained similar to those
   observed in 2012 with the exception of increased density in the smallest
   diameter class. In untreated units, the majority of tree density
   reductions occurred in the 10-30 cm dbh classes. Post-fire tree
   mortality was stable across treated and untreated units, with no
   significant differences; however, abundant ingrowth of small hardwoods
   occurred throughout the study area. Large-tree density decreased by
   about 20\% in both treated and untreated units between 2012 and 2016.
   Evidence of post-fire bark beetles was generally low and patchy
   throughout the study site; however, beetle activity was more widespread
   in untreated units. Twice as many trees were attacked by bark beetles in
   untreated versus treated units suggesting treatments may have reduced
   post-fire beetle activity. Following wildfire, observed conifer
   regeneration was lower and hardwood regeneration was higher with
   increasing burn severity; conifer regeneration was nearly three times
   higher in treated units. This study suggests that pre-fire fuel
   reduction treatments contribute less to mid-term resiliency than to
   short-term resiliency of forested ecosystems. We observed trends of
   higher resilience to insect outbreaks and potential implications for
   type change from conifer to deciduous forest. Furthermore, our study
   underscores the importance of understanding mid-term post-fire recovery,
   and while it provides insights regarding recovery of these ecosystems,
   additional monitoring and research is needed to fully understand the
   implications toward long-term resiliency.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the response of Lazuli Bunting (Passerina amoena) to fire in
   Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) woodland at Camp Williams, Utah, during
   1993-1998. Overall, Lazuli Bunting abundance on the study area increased
   significantly during the 2 years after a stand-replacing wildfire, which
   covered 800 ha of Gambel oak woodland. This increase suggested that
   Lazuli Buntings respond positively to fire. However, a comparison of
   pre- and post-fire abundance of Lazuli Bunting for 2 groups of
   monitoring plots with different fire histories showed that abundance was
   significantly greater during the post-fire period for both burned and
   unburned plots. When we examined our data at a spatial scale appropriate
   to Lazuli Bunting, we found that post-fire increases observed on
   unburned plots were limited to plots in close proximity to the burned
   area. A comparison of pre- and post-fire abundance of Lazuli Bunting for
   3 groups of monitoring plots located at various distances from the
   burned area revealed that post-fire abundance was similar only for plots
   within the fire boundary and for those <= 1000 in from the fire
   boundary; plots located > 1000 in from the fire boundary had fewer
   individuals per plot post-fire. However, prefire Lazuli Bunting
   abundance was similar among all 3 categories. This differential,
   spatially scaled response of Lazuli Bunting to fire at the landscape
   level may support a hierarchical view of habitat selection.}},

   this study is to investigate the post-fire regeneration patterns of
   black pine after a high severity crown fire which occurred on Mt
   Taygetos in Southern Greece. A network of 18 sites was selected to study
   black pine natural post-fire regeneration. Regeneration density was
   higher at the edges of patches that have remained unburned within the
   periphery of fire (0.406 individuals/m(2)) as compared to isolated
   burned areas (0.007 individuals/m(2)) although a significant between
   sites heterogeneity was recorded. Boosted regression trees analysis was
   used to explore the effects of environmental and microhabitat variables
   on black pine post-fire regeneration. The number of fires a site has
   experienced had a negative effect on regeneration density, while the
   presence of recovering ferns had a positive effect. The most important
   variable related to the black pine post-fire regeneration was distance
   from unburned patches. The result of the current study substantiates the
   importance of maintaining fire-resistant stands with large trees that
   are more likely to survive after a surface fire and which can also serve

Abstract = {{Wildfire area and severity are projected to increase in Eurasian larch
   (Larix spp.) forest, potentially altering ecosystem dynamics and carbon
   balance under warming climate. However, the ecological drivers that
   influence post-fire ecosystem productivity in larch forest are poorly

   plant aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) on the early
   successional stage of Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii) forests following
   fire. We quantified the relative importance of fire severity,
   competition, topography, and soil inorganic N {[}NH4+ and NO3-]
   availability on ecosystem productivity 11 years post-fire in a Dahurian
   larch forest of Northeast China using a boosted regression trees
   technique. Results showed that fire severity had the strongest negative
   influence on ANPP of saplings, followed by a positive influence of soil
   inorganic N availability and negative influence of elevation. Sapling
   density had the strongest negative influence on ANPP of understory
   (shrub and grass), followed by positive influence of aspect and
   inorganic N availability. N may limit ANPP of sapling, but not of
   understory vegetation. Fire severity had a dominant influence on the
   proportion of total ANPP contributed by the understory. Fire severity
   was positively correlated to understory productivity and proportion of
   total ANPP contributed by understory, but negatively correlated to
   sapling productivity. Our analysis suggests that increasing fire
   severity may increase understory productivity, while decreasing the
   sapling productivity, which may contribute to the potential changes of

Abstract = {{Question: Is post-fire, medium-term vegetation dynamics determined by
   land-use or fire history prior to fire?
   Location: South-facing slope in the Gallinera valley, Alicante province,
   eastern Spain.
   Methods: After mapping the land-use and fire history of the study site
   using photo-interpretation, we sampled vegetation structure on a set of
   plots representing the most frequent land-use and fire history
   combinations on an area burned six years before sampling. We studied the
   effects of land-use history, comparing the one-fire land-use
   trajectories. We analysed the effects of fire history; comparing one-and
   two-fire plots for both previously cropped and uncropped areas.
   Results: Most variables were not significantly different between the
   earliest abandoned plots ( abandoned at least 38 years before the fire)
   and the uncropped plots. On the most recently abandoned plots (
   abandoned between one and four years before the fire), the therophyte
   richness and the ratio of seeder: resprouter richness were significantly
   greatest. Different fire recurrences did not determine different
   post-fire vegetation on either the uncropped or the early abandoned
   plots ( all dominated by fire-recruited seeder shrubs). The most
   recently abandoned plots had a lower resilience to fire.
   Conclusions: Land-use history and recent pre-fire land use, in
   particular, determined the post-fire vegetation in the medium term. The
   vegetation composition converged during secondary succession among
   land-use histories. Increasing fire recurrence had a small effect on
   mature plant communities, due to the combination of life-history traits
   determining the response to fire of the dominant species.}},

Abstract = {{The early post-fire plant succession in fynbos vegetation in the
   Mediterranean-type climate area of South Africa was studied. Relatively
   little has been published on this early stage of plant succession in
   fynbos. Annual sampling over the first three post-fire years confirmed a
   steady, but relatively slow increase in plant canopy cover of shrubs and
   graminoids (mainly Restionaceae), whereas cover of geophytes and other
   herbs peaked in the first year and declined significantly, thereafter.
   Cover of annual plants increased each year, which may relate to the
   persistence of a relatively open vegetation cover by the third year. The
   responses of reseeder and resprouter species of the Restionaceae to the
   post-fire environment appeared to be habitat dependent. Cover of the
   reseeders increased rapidly in seep areas, but their recovery was
   distinctly delayed in dryland areas outside the seeps. Re-establishment
   of the many reseeder Erica species appeared to be delayed until the
   second post-fire year. Seed banks of these species were possibly
   negatively impacted by the fire, and required dispersal of seed from
   unburnt areas for recruitment. In contrast to some current
   generalisations, species richness appeared to increase after the fire;
   less certainly from the first to the second year, but more certainly
   from the second to the third year. Therefore, this study does not
   support a short-term monotonic decline in species richness after fire in

Abstract = {{Question: We tested whether (1) the change in composition and structure
   of whole plant communities after fire is directly related to
   regeneration of the dominant tree species in the canopy; (2) the change
   in structure and composition of plant communities several years after
   fire decreases with the proportion of obligate seeders and (3) the
   proportion of obligate seeders in plant communities increases with the
   dryness gradient.
   Location: Catalonia (NE Spain).
   Methods: We measured floristic differences between burned and long-since
   burned sites in eight vegetation types across a climate gradient. We
   compared 22 sites burnt in 1994 in paired plots with 22 sites that had
   not been burnt since the 1940s. In each site we placed plots in burned
   and long-since burned areas, where we identified the presence and
   abundance of all plant species.
   Results: When the tree canopy recovers, structure and composition of the
   vegetation also return to the long-since burned community; when tree
   canopy does not recover, composition of the post-fire community varies
   compared to the long-since burned one. A higher proportion of obligate
   seeders in the pre-fire community promotes quicker regeneration of the
   original community. The proportion of obligate seeders increased along
   the dryness gradient.
   Conclusions: Regeneration of plant communities after fire depends on the
   vegetation type before the fire. Regeneration increases when the
   dominant tree or shrub species persists after fire and with a higher
   proportion of obligate seeders in the pre-fire community. The proportion
   of obligate seeders varies along the dryness gradient, which suggests
   that vegetation in drier areas (when seeders are more abundant) recovers
   earlier than in moister areas.}},

Abstract = {{Fire intensity affects ecological and geophysical processes in
   fire-prone landscapes. We examined the potential for satellite imagery
   (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre {[}SPOT2] and Landsat7) to
   detect and map fire severity patterns in a rugged landscape with
   variable vegetation near Sydney, Australia. A post-fire,
   vegetation-based indicator of fire intensity (burnt shrub branch tip
   diameters, representing the size of fuel consumed) was also used to
   explore whether fire severity patterns can be used to retrospectively
   infer patterns of fire intensity. Six severity classes (ranging from
   unburnt to complete crown consumption) were defined using aerial
   photograph interpretation and a field assessment across five vegetation
   types of varying height and complexity (sedge-swamp, heath, woodland,
   open forest, and tall forest). Using established Normalised Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing methodology, SPOT2 and Landsat7
   imagery yielded similar broad-scale severity patterns across the study
   area. This was despite differences in image resolution (10m and 30m,
   respectively) and capture dates (2 months and 9 months apart,
   respectively). However, differences in the total areas mapped for some
   severity classes were found. In particular, there was reduced
   differentiation between unburnt and low-severity areas and between
   crown-scorched and crown-consumed areas when using the Landsat7 data.
   These differences were caused by fine-scale classification anomalies and
   were most likely associated with seasonal differences in vegetation
   condition (associated with time of image capture), post-fire movement of
   ash, resprouting of vegetation, and low sun elevation. Relationships
   between field severity class and NDVIdifference values revealed that
   vegetation type does influence the detection of fire severity using
   these types of satellite data: regression slopes were greater for
   woodland, forest, and tall forest data than for sedge-swamp and heath
   data. The effect of vegetation type on areas mapped in each fire
   severity class was examined but found to be minimal in the present study
   due to the uneven distribution of vegetation types in the study area
   (woodland and open forest cover 86\% of the landscape). Field
   observations of burnt shrub branch tips, which were used as a surrogate
   for fire intensity, revealed that relationships between fire severity
   and fire intensity are confounded by vegetation type (mainly height). A
   method for inferring fire intensity from remotely sensed patterns of
   fire severity was proposed in which patterns of fire severity and
   vegetation type are combined.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire vegetation dynamics is examined over an extended timescale, to
   investigate the long-term effects of fire on plant diversity and to
   verify if a succession model, such as Clements' ``relay floristic{''} or
   Egler's ``initial floristic{''} models, applies to post-fire dynamics in
   Mediterranean communities. In the Alpilles massif, Provence, southern
   France, 20 plots were sampled at each of six sites; five that had been
   burned by wildfires within the last 30 years (1977, 1983, 1989, 1999 and
   2003), and a control site not burned for at least 80 years. Temporal
   variations in relative species density are modelled by regression
   curves. The structure of diversity is analysed based on mean species
   richness (alpha), beta diversity (beta(w)), Shannon diversity index (H)
   and relative equitability index (E-h), knowing that the Egler's model
   leads to the prediction that richness should be highest immediately
   following disturbance. No significant differences in species richness
   were detected between sites, and species diversity is not related to
   time since the last fire except 2 years after fire that shows the
   highest beta(w)-diversity resulting from an elevated list of species per
   site (gamma-diversity) immediately after fire. Instead, an effect of
   site location on species diversity is detected. The observed post-fire
   dynamics show a progressive transition between three stages, from
   initial, through transitional to mature. Each stage is characterized by
   different relative species density. Furthermore, several plant species
   can be considered as early, intermediate or late successional species
   with regards to their density at different times after burning. In
   conclusion, initial floristic composition model (Egler's model) applies
   to this ecosystem, with all species present at the early post-fire
   dynamics, and the diversity shows the highest gamma-diversity 2 years
   after fire. In the long term (>50 years), a successional pathway can be
   discerned. The growth rates and longevity of main species influence the
   post-fire dynamics. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana ecosystems evolved with periodic

   increases in the native tree Juniperus occidentalis, which outcompetes
   the native understory. We applied prescribed fire in spring and fall at
   three sites (native-dominated, B. tectorum-dominated, and J.

Abstract = {{Post-fire recovery of perennial plants depends on their capacity to
   regrow from surviving meristems. Plants are adapted to a particular fire
   regime, which can be altered by human activities and climatic change.
   Therefore, predicting the impact of changing fire regimes on post-fire
   vegetation recovery has become a major ecological concern. We studied
   the effects of fire temperature on survival and growth of the dominant
   tussock grasses Festuca pallescens and Pappostipa speciosa for two
   post-fire growing seasons in NW Patagonian grasslands. Using a portable
   propane burner, we applied two fire temperature treatments to individual
   plants: 200-500 A degrees C (low temperature) and 500-900 A degrees C
   (high temperature). Plant mortality was higher in F. pallescens than in
   P. speciosa, possibly due to morphological differences. Fire damaged
   active meristems in both species, which delayed emergence of new
   tillers. This in turn affected leaf length of tillers, which was lower
   in burned plants during the first growing season. Despite this, growth
   rate was higher in burned plants once they regrow only during the first
   growing season. In summer, post-fire hot and dry conditions affected F.
   pallescens survival. Although fire temperature affected negatively F.
   pallescens survival, both tussock grasses recovered quickly after the
   experimental burns. This response could favour their persistence and
   dominance in the community. Our study increases understanding of
   post-fire responses in grasslands and will provide important rangeland
   management information for grasslands in Patagonia.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of fire severity and initial post-fire tree composition on
   long-term stand structural development were investigated in the Picea
   mariana-feathermoss bioclimatic domain of northwestern Quebec.
   Paleoecological methods were used to categorize the severity of the last
   fire (high or low) and initial tree composition (Picea mariana versus
   Pinus banksiana). Changes in stand structure were evaluated by
   quantifying stand structural attributes along three chronosequences.
   Except for accelerating stand break-up, the post-fire presence of P
   banksiana (which is eventually replaced by P mariana) had little effect
   on stand structural development. Fire severity had significant effects
   on the evolution of stand structural attributes, with low severity fires
   being particularly detrimental for stand productivity. Stands colonizing
   low severity fires were characterized by low post-fire tree recruitment
   and growth and remained open throughout succession. In contrast, after
   high severity fires, dense productive stands were rapidly established
   regardless of tree composition and gradually became open as succession
   proceeded. These results suggest that in the prolonged absence of fire,
   the different stand structural development pathways gradually converge
   regardless of fire severity or initial composition. We argue that stand
   structural diversity within the coniferous boreal forest is a result of
   the severity of the last fire and of processes operating at the stand

Abstract = {{Predicting the response of faunal communities to fire presents a
   challenge for land managers worldwide because the post-fire responses of
   species may vary between locations and fire events. Post-fire recovery
   can occur via nucleated recovery from in situ surviving populations or
   by colonization from ex situ populations. Fine-scale spatial patterns in
   the patchiness of fires and the proximity of burnt sites to source
   populations may contribute to both the variability in post-fire
   responses and the processes by which populations recover. We examined
   the avifauna at recently burnt sites within extensive semi-arid
   shrublands of south-eastern Australia, including 72 sites <?5 years
   since fire and 26 sites 10 years since fire. Study sites represented a
   gradient of increasing distance from unburnt vegetation (i.e. >?27 years
   since fire) and varied in the presence or absence of small (25900?m2)
   unburnt patches of vegetation. For sites <?5 years since fire, species
   richness was higher at sites closer to unburnt vegetation and at sites
   containing unburnt patches. These patterns were no longer evident at
   sites of 10 years since fire. The probability of occurrence of three of
   seven bird species modelled decreased with increasing distance to
   unburnt vegetation, but this pattern was evident only at sites burnt
   uniformly. One species was found almost exclusively at patchily burnt
   sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity
   to unburnt vegetation enhances post-fire occupancy, and that
   colonization from ex situ populations is an important process for
   post-fire recovery of avifauna. Additionally, small unburnt patches
   enhance the rapid recovery of assemblages post-fire. These patterns are
   important for understanding the dynamics of post-fire population
   recovery. We recommend that management of fire for ecological purposes
   should explicitly consider the role that the spatial attributes of fires
   play in determining the post-fire community.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of vegetation in Mediterranean ecosystems after wildfire is
   mostly a result of direct regeneration, since the same species existing
   before the fire regenerate on-site by seeding or resprouting. However,
   the possibility of plant colonization by dispersal of seeds from
   unburned areas remains poorly studied. We addressed the role of the
   frugivorous, bird-dependent seed dispersal (seed rain) of fleshy-fruited
   plants in a burned and managed forest in the second winter after a fire,
   before on-site fruit production had begun. We also assessed the effect
   on seed rain of different microhabitats resulting from salvage logging
   (erosion barriers, standing snags, open areas), as well as the
   microhabitats of unlogged patches and an unburned control forest, taking
   account of the importance of perches as seed rain sites. We found
   considerable seed rain by birds in the burned area. Seeds, mostly from
   Olive trees Olea europaea and Evergreen pistaches Pistacia lentiscus,
   belonged to plants fruiting only in surrounding unburned areas. Seed
   rain was heterogeneous, and depended on microhabitat, with the highest
   seed density in the unburned control forest but closely followed by the
   wood piles of erosion barriers. In contrast, very low densities were
   found under perches of standing snags. Furthermore, frugivorous bird
   richness seemed to be higher in the erosion barriers than elsewhere. Our
   results highlight the importance of this specific post-fire management
   in bird-dependent seed rain and also may suggest a consequent
   heterogeneous distribution of fleshy-fruited plants in burned and
   managed areas. However, there needs to be more Study of the
   establishment success of dispersed seeds before an accurate assessment

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to study the effectiveness of two post-fire
   emergence rehabilitation techniques (seeding and mulching) for reducing
   soil erosion as well as their effects on the soil quality; therefore in
   the field, experimental plots of unburnt soil, burnt soil, burnt soil
   plus seeding and burnt soil plus mulching were established. Soil samples
   were collected from the A horizon and a wide range of physical, chemical
   and biological soil properties were analyzed to evaluate soil quality.
   The effect of fire on the vegetation cover was observed after one year
   and changes in soil properties persisted even after four years. The
   phospholipid fatty acids pattern showed that in the medium-term (8-48
   months after the fire), the fire may modify the soil microbial
   communities by altering the plant community via plant-induced changes in
   the soil environment. No effect of seeding or mulching on the vegetation
   cover was observed. The mean efficiency in preventing soil erosion
   between 8 and 12 months after the fire and the application of the
   treatments was 11\% for seeding and 65\% for mulching. These
   stabilization treatments had a minor influence on the post-fire soil
   quality in the medium term (48 months); therefore, taking into account
   its effectiveness for reducing soil erosion, the mulching treatment is
   recommended as the best post-fire stabilization technique.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of forest burnt areas has several aims: to locate and
   estimate the extent of such areas; to assess the damages suffered by the
   forest stands; to check the ability of the ecosystem to naturally
   recover after the fire; to support the planning of reclamation
   interventions; to assess the dynamics (pattern and speed) of the natural
   recovery; to check the outcome of any eventual restoration intervention.
   Remote sensing is an important source of information to support all such
   tasks. In the last decades, the effectiveness of remotely sensed imagery
   is increasing due to the advancement of tools and techniques, and to the
   lowering of the costs, in relative terms. For an effective support to
   post-fire management (burnt scar perimeter mapping, damage severity
   assessment, post-fire vegetation monitoring), a mapping scale of at
   least 1:10000-1:20000 is required: hence, the selection of remotely
   sensed data is restricted to aerial imagery and to satellite imagery
   characterized by high (HR) and, above all, very high (VHR) spatial
   resolution. In the last decade, HR and VHR passive (optical) remote
   sensing has widespread, providing affordable multitemporal and
   multispectral pictures of the considered phenomena, at different scales
   (spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions) with reference to the
   monitoring needs. In the light of such a potential, the integration of
   GPS field survey and imagery by light aerial vectors or VHR satellite is
   currently sought as a viable option for the post-fire monitoring.}},

Journal = {{IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{5-7}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Every year about 45 000 forest fires occur in Europe, burning half a
   million hectares of forests and rural lands; between 1995 and 2004, more
   than 4 million hectares burned in the Mediterranean Region alone.
   Post-fire management of burned areas has been given much lesser
   attention than combating or preventing fires. However, important
   questions raise public concern and call for sound scientific knowledge
   to undertake appropriate post-fire actions: e. g., how to evaluate fire
   damages in economical terms? How to manage burned areas? Is it possible
   to establish, in the long-term, less flammable and more fire resilient
   forests and landscapes? To address these questions, a network of
   researchers and practitioners working in the field of fire ecology and
   forest management from all around Europe has been established in the
   frame of ``COST Action FP0701-Post-Fire Forest Management in Southern
   Europe{''}, supported by the European Union Research and Technology
   Development Framework Program. The Action aims to: i) develop and
   disseminate scientifically based decision criteria for planning
   post-fire forest management, from the stand to the landscape level; ii)
   translate this scientific knowledge into management practices; iii)
   connect scientists and stakeholders for exchanging experiences,
   evaluating these practices, and putting them into practice. To achieve
   these objectives the scientific groups involved will a) review and
   summarize the current scientific knowledge on post-fire management in
   Europe, by gathering and evaluating the results of previous and ongoing
   research; b) translate this knowledge into technical recommendations, by
   producing thematic reports, a book on the state-of-the-art of scientific
   knowledge on post fire assessment, and an electronic handbook on
   post-fire restoration; c) disseminate this knowledge to stakeholders,
   practitioners and decision makers. Besides publications and a project
   website already active (http://uaeco.biol.uoa.gr/cost/), training
   schools and one major conference will be organized. Although focused on
   Southern Europe, the outcomes of this Action will be crucial for central
   and northern European countries as well, as climate change and land use
   changes often leading to more homogeneous and expanding forest areas are
   already increasing fire hazard in those regions.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the dynamics of aboveground forest woody carbon pools - live
   trees, standing dead trees, and down wood-during the first 6 years
   following wildfire across a wide range of conditions, which are
   characteristic of California forest fires. From repeated measurements of

   of crown fire severity as indicated by a post-fire index, years since
   fire, pre-fire woody carbon, forest type group ( hardwood vs. softwood),
   elevation, and climate attributes. Our analysis relied on 130 U.S.
   national forest inventory plots measured before and 1 year after fire,
   with one additional remeasurement within 6 years after fire. There was
   no evidence of net change in total wood carbon, defined for this study
   as the wood in standing trees larger than 12.7 cm diameter at breast
   height and down wood larger than 7.6 cm in diameter, over the post-fire
   period in any of the three severity classes. Stands that burned at low
   severity exhibited considerable shifts from live to standing dead and
   down wood pools. In stands that burned at moderate severity, live wood
   decreased significantly whereas no net change was detected in standing
   dead or down wood. High severity fire burning resulted in movement from
   standing dead to down wood pools. Our results suggest that the carbon
   trajectories for stand-replacing fires may not be appropriate for the
   majority of California's forest area that burned at low to moderate
   severities.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a key factor impacting soil hydrology in many Mediterranean
   catchments. Soil water repellency (SWR) can stimulate land degradation
   processes by reducing the affinity of soil and water thereby triggering
   a reduction in soil fertility and increasing soil and water losses. The
   effects of two consequent fires (1989 and 2005) on SWR were assessed in
   the Carmel Mountains, Israel. Fire history, plant recovery and post-fire
   management (14 treatments) were investigated as determining factors in a
   time dependent system. In total 210 locations were investigated 9 times
   from October 2011 to February 2012, which totals 1890 water drop
   penetration tests that were performed. During each visit to the field (9
   times) a soil moisture content was measured for each treatment. SWR was
   highest in the >50 years unburnt plots, where soil under Pinus
   halepensis is most hydrophobic. In the most disturbed soils (twice
   burnt), many sites have a low to absent SWR even if the soil is very
   dry. The dynamics and fluctuations in SWR differ in magnitude under
   different plant species. The areas treated with CC (chipping of charred
   trees) showed a much higher SWR than areas left untreated. From these
   insights, a conceptual model of the reaction. of SWR on multiple fires
   was developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   forests in eastern Canada}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An emerging paradigm regarding vegetation response to climate warming is
   that the interaction of weather extremes and disturbance will trigger
   abrupt changes in ecosystem types by overcoming resilience of dominant
   species. Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)) ecosystems are widespread
   across the North American boreal forest, because of ecophysiological
   adaptations that allowed these communities to thrive in fire-prone
   areas. We investigated resilience of spruce-moss forests to
   weather-disturbance interaction after a 3-year period (2005 to 2007) of
   major fire activity caused by extreme fire weather in eastern Canada.
   Pre- and post-fire conifer densities and environmental parameters
   related to seed rain, post-fire seedbeds, microclimate, and post-fire
   weather were measured in 133 burned stands throughout the closed-crown
   forest of Quebec. Critically low black spruce (BS) regeneration was
   observed in almost all of the stands, leading to a decrease in stand
   density and a shift of species dominance from BS to jack pine (Pinus
   banksiana (Lamb.), JP). The studied sites were characterized by thick
   residual organic matter, resulting in a predominance of charred duff, a
   seedbed associated with low water retention and high variation in
   temperature. While high levels of JP seedling establishment were
   reported on this seedbed, it was unfavorable to BS germination and
   survival in the context of warm and dry weather that prevailed in
   post-fire summers. In these ecosystems, early vegetation establishment
   patterns are generally reliable predictors of future stand composition
   and the exclusion of BS will presumably be maintained through
   succession. During large fire years, high proportions of the landscape
   are subjected to the interaction of fire regime and weather that creates
   unsuitable conditions for BS regeneration. Hence, vegetation change is
   susceptible to happen at a broad scale. Therefore, the frequency of
   major fire years could have a decisive influence on the rate of
   vegetation response to climate change in this biome.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fuel treatments are designed with multiple management goals, including
   improving suppres- sion capacity and restoring the historical structure
   of dry forests. Fuelbreak are a class of fuel treatment that remove
   fuels within a wide strip of land, with an overarching objective to
   reduce fire behavior and provide safe access for suppression. In an
   empirical analysis of shaded fuelbreaks that burned during the 2014 Bald
   Fire (15,950 ha on the Lassen National Forest, California, USA), we
   found that overall fire severity was reduced in the treated areas
   relative to untreated. A non-linear mixed effects model estimates that
   the reduction was detected more than 400 m into the treated area,
   greater than the standard width of the prescribed fuelbreak. Both pre-
   and post-fire species composition differed between treated and untreated
   forest, with few living stems remaining in the measured untreated areas.
   In the post-fire treated area, we documented a mixed conifer forest
   dominated by larger diameter Pinus, implying that the fuelbreak did
   result in a more resilient post-fire structure and composition. These
   results indicate that fuelbreak design may need to be wider than

Abstract = {{The only fully coupled land-atmosphere global climate model predicts a
   widespread dieback of Amazonian forest cover through reduced
   precipitation. Although these predictions are controversial, the
   structural and compositional resilience of Amazonian forests may also
   have been overestimated, as current vegetation models fail to consider
   the potential role of fire in the degradation of forest ecosystems. We
   examine forest structure and composition in the Arapiuns River basin in
   the central Brazilian Amazon, evaluating post-fire forest recovery and
   the consequences of recurrent fires for the patterns of dominance of
   tree species. We surveyed tree plots in unburned and once-burned forests
   examined 1, 3 and 9 years after an unprecedented fire event, in
   twice-burned forests examined 3 and 9 years after fire and in
   thrice-burned forests examined 5 years after the most recent fire event.
   The number of trees recorded in unburned primary forest control plots
   was stable over time. However, in both once-and twice-burned forest
   plots, there was a marked recruitment into the 10-20 cm diameter at
   breast height tree size classes between 3 and 9 years post-fire.
   Considering tree assemblage composition 9 years after the first fire
   contact, we observed (i) a clear pattern of community turnover among
   small trees and the most abundant shrubs and saplings, and (ii) that
   species that were common in any of the four burn treatments (unburned,
   once-, twice-and thrice-burned) were often rare or entirely absent in
   other burn treatments. We conclude that episodic wildfires can lead to
   drastic changes in forest structure and composition, with cascading
   shifts in forest composition following each additional fire event.
   Finally, we use these results to evaluate the validity of the
   savannization paradigm.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Management of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests relies on frequent
   prescribed fire to maintain desirable plant communities. Prescribed fire
   is often applied while female wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) are
   reproductively active and may immediately affect habitat availability
   and demographic outcomes. We identified covariates affecting selection
   of areas used by nesting and brooding females and determined if these
   covariates influenced nest and brood survival in a longleaf pine
   ecosystem. We captured 63 female wild turkeys and measured vegetation
   and landscape characteristics surrounding nests, brood roosts, and
   daytime use sites. We used conditional logistic regression to determine
   which vegetation and landscape-scale characteristics influenced nest,
   brood roost, or daytime use sites. We generated Cox proportional hazard
   models at multiple spatial scales to determine if selection influenced
   nest and brood survival. Females selected nest sites with greater visual
   obstruction and increased ground cover, and also nested closer to roads.
   We observed relevant differences in vegetation and landscape variables
   associated with where females chose to roost broods compared to sites
   chosen for foraging or loafing. Females roosted broods at sites with
   increased ground cover and decreased visual obstruction, and daytime use
   by broods was most related to increases in ground cover. Time-since-fire
   was an informative covariate for brood site selection but not for nest
   site selection. Females selected brood roost sites in stands not
   recently burned (3-6 yr post-fire), and selected daytime use sites in
   stands burned the current year (0 yr post-fire) and 2 years post-fire.
   We failed to observe links between selection of vegetation and landscape
   covariates and probability of nest or brood survival. Notably, our
   results suggest short (i.e., 1-2 yr) fire return intervals do not
   provide vegetation communities selected by females to roost broods.
   Conversely, stands burned within the current year were important for
   daytime use by broods. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the
   importance of maintaining diverse fire return intervals to ensure
   availability of vegetation conditions necessary for nesting and
   brooding. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{During 2-5 December 2010, an area of 2500ha in the Carmel forests was
   consumed by a severe wildfire, causing soil erosion from the exposed
   slopes. Whereas most studies show that post-fire erosion rates tend to
   decline after the second year, in this case, we aim to address the
   ongoing consequences that different management practices had on soil
   erosion 3 and 4 years after a fire. Three management operations were
   applied: (a) preservation management (PM) - mulching wood chips on the
   burned area; (b) tree-clearing management (TCM) - burned trees were cut
   and removed; and (c) skid-trail formation (ST) - provisional pathways
   were formed while trees were dragged outside. Consequently, the
   objectives of the study were: (1) to monitor the effects of these
   post-fire practices 3 and 4 years after fire; and (2) to characterise
   the physical features of the eroded soil. The sediments were collected
   after every effective rain event over two rainy seasons (2013-14,
   2014-15). TCM and ST practices resulted in significantly elevated
   soil-erosion yields compared to PM. The sediments following PM had a
   high percentage of fine material. Furthermore, PM had an evident
   positive effect on the soil, whereas all other practices inhibited
   vegetation renewal and system rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{High intensity wildfires in semiarid shrub and woodland plant
   communities can leave ecosystems incapable of self-repair and
   susceptible to weed invasion. Subsequently, land managers need effective
   restoration tools to reseed native vegetation back into these degraded
   systems. In order to develop successful post-fire restoration approaches
   in these communities, it is critical that we understand the mechanisms
   that impair reseeding success. Our objective was to quantify the
   influence of soil water repellency on seedling emergence and plant
   growth in a greenhouse study using soil cores obtained from beneath
   burned Juniperus osteosperma trees. Soil cores were seeded with either
   Elymus wawawaiensis or Agropyron cristatum, and watered with either a
   high (watered daily) or a low water regime ( watered every 5 days).
   During the first watering event, water repellency was ameliorated in
   half the cores by adding a wetting-agent comprised of
   alkylpolyglycoside-ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers.
   Results showed that water repellency reduced seedling emergence and
   seedling survival by decreasing soil moisture availability.
   Wetting-agents improved ecohydrologic properties required for plant
   growth by decreasing runoff and increasing the amount and duration of
   available water for seedling emergence, survival, and plant growth.
   These results indicate that soil water repellency can act as an
   ecological threshold by impairing establishment of reseeded species
   after afire. Where restoration efforts are limited by soil water
   repellency, wetting agents have the potential to improve the success of
   post-fire reseeding efforts. Future work is needed to validate these
   findings in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Canadian boreal forests are increasingly modified by post-fire removal
   of trees (salvage logging), yet the ecological consequences of this
   practice are little studied. As mixed-wood forests have recently become
   accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood
   (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and
   adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus
   banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn
   severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect
   counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire
   amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low=7-15\% and high=25-35\% of the
   unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control=no salvaging to
   high=60-70\% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity
   (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are
   presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total
   woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably
   black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to
   increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes
   auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in
   the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed
   woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and
   second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in
   mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to
   increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat
   was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent
   winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood
   areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn
   severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with
   chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among
   coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees
   had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce
   (ca. 65-75\% versus 15\% of trees). These results indicate the crucial
   influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests
   and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention
   of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support
   these dead-wood dependent birds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Key message In the African rim of the Western Mediterranean Basin, cork
   oak forests and pine plantations coexist. Under similar fire regimes,
   cork oak forest is more resilient in terms of habitat structure (canopy,
   understory, and complexity of vegetation strata) than pine plantation.
   By contrast, both woodland types show similar resilience in plant
   species composition. Resilience in habitat structure varies between the
   two woodland types because of the resprouting and seeding strategies of
   cork oak and pine species, respectively. These differences can be
   relevant for the conservation of biodiversity of forested ecosystems in
   a future scenario of increased fire frequency and scale in the
   Mediterranean basin.
   Context Wildfires have major impacts on ecosystems globally. In
   fire-prone regions, plant species have developed adaptive traits
   (resprouting and seeding) to survive and persist due to long
   evolutionary coexistence with fire. In the African rim of the Western
   Mediterranean Basin, cork oak forest and pine plantation are the most
   frequently burnt woodlands. Both species have different strategies to
   respond fire: cork oak is a resprouter while pines are mostly seeders.
   Aims We have examined the hypothesis that pine plantations are less
   resilient in habitat structure (canopy, understory, diversity of
   vegetation strata) and plant composition than cork oak woodlands.
   Methods The habitat structure and plant species composition were
   measured in 30 burnt and 30 unburnt 700-m transects at 12 burnt sites
   from north-western Africa, where the two forest types can coexist.
   Habitat structure and plant species composition were compared between
   burnt and unburnt transects from cork oak and pine plantation woodlands
   with generalized linear mixed models and general linear models.
   Results The results showed significant interaction effect of fire and
   forest type, since cork oak forest was more resilient to fire than was
   pine plantation in habitat structure. By contrast, both forest types
   were resilient to fire in the composition of the plant communities,
   i.e., plant composition prior to fire did not change afterwards.
   Conclusion The higher structural resilience of cork oak forest compared
   to pine plantation is related to the resprouting and seeding strategies,
   respectively, of the dominant tree species. Differences in the responses
   to fire need to be considered in conservation planning for the
   maintenance of the Mediterranean biodiversity in a future scenario of
   changes in fire regime.}},

   plant mortality and seedling regeneration. Mortality of stems caused by

Abstract = {{We document post-fire succession on xeric sites in the southern

   studies over 18 yr on permanent plots that had burned in 1976-1977
   indicate that tree mortality and vegetation response varied with fuel
   load and fire season. In the first three years after fire, hardwood
   sprouts dominated tree regeneration. On sites where summer and autumn
   fires reduced litter depth to less than I cm, densities of
   shade-intolerant Pinus seedlings increased steadily over this period. 4
   to 8 yr after fire, large numbers of newly established seedlings and
   sprouts had grown to 1 - 10 cm DBH. By year 18 growth of these saplings
   led to canopy closure on most sites. Herbaceous cover and richness
   peaked in the first decade after fire, then declined. On similar sites
   that had not burned in more than 50 yr, regeneration of shade-intolerant
   Pinus spp. and mean cover and richness of herbs were considerably lower
   than those observed on recently burned plots. Reconstructions of
   landscape conditions based on observed post-fire succession and 20th

Abstract = {{In September 1989 a fire burned a large natural Pinus halepensis Mill.
   forest on Mt. Carmel, Israel. This paper summarizes the main results of
   five years of research, in which the effects of natural factors and
   management on the development of the forest and the vegetation were
   studied. It was found that the burned pine tree skeletons were
   correlated with the spatial pattern of seed germination.. Fewer pine
   seedlings were found one year after the fire near the burned trunks, but
   the survival and growth rate of these young pine trees was higher in the
   following four years. Pine ash was found to inhibit post-fire seed
   germination, offering a possible explanation for the apparent effect of
   the old burned trees on the spatial pattern of the new pine seedlings.
   Both laboratory experiments and field measurements indicate that the
   high pH of the ash, is the main factor responsible for the inhibition of
   germination. We examined several management regimes designed to enhance
   the growth of the young post-fire pine trees and assess their influence
   on the recovery of the forest. The results revealed that four years
   after fire, and three years after treatments, forest regeneration was
   mainly affected by the natural process while management had only a
   marginal effect. Management such as cutting and leaving, or cutting and
   removing the burned trunks and twigs from the plots, had almost no
   effect on species composition and cover. However, thinning of Pinus and
   Cistus seedlings increased survival and growth of remaining seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires may have serious and long-lasting impacts in Mediterranean

   oak trees that burned and were cut in six sites with the objective of
   identifying the main factors affecting the short- to medium-term
   post-fire recovery. We used linear mixed models to investigate potential
   relationships among tree stump status at the end of the second and fifth
   growing seasons and several tree- and site-level variables. Overall tree
   mortality in the second year was 44\% and was negatively affected by
   bark thickness and positively affected by root exposure, trunk injuries,

Abstract = {{Fire is a driving force in the North American landscape and predicting
   post-fire tree mortality is vital to land management. Post-fire tree
   mortality can have substantial economic and social impacts, and natural
   resource managers need reliable predictive methods to anticipate
   potential mortality following fire events. Current fire mortality models
   are limited to a few species and regions, notably Pinus ponderosa and
   Pseudotsuga menziesii in the western United States. The efficacy of
   existing mortality models to predict fire-induced tree mortality is
   central to effective forest management. This study validated 54 logistic
   regression mortality models from seven published articles and two sets
   of mortality guidelines from two sources. Survival and a suite of fire
   injury metrics were monitored for 3654 trees representing 14 species
   that burned in fires between 2002 and 2009 in the Pacific Northwest,
   USA. Tree species included Abies amabilis, A. concolor, A. grandis, A.
   lasiocarpa, Calocedrus decurrens, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, C.
   nootkatensis, Thuja plicata, Pinus contorta, P. lambertiana, P.
   monticola, Picea engelmannii, Larix occidentalis, and Tsuga
   heterophylla. Existing logistic models adequately described post-fire
   mortality of A. concolor, A. lasiocarpa, C. decurrens, C. lawsoniana, L.
   occidentalis, P. engelmannii, P. contorta, and P. lambertiana. We also
   evaluated predictive accuracy of two published mortality guidelines that
   apply to species in the Pacific Northwest. In addition to validating
   existing models, we also developed new logistic regression models and
   simplified mortality guidelines, or thresholds. We created new logistic
   regression models for species with adequate sample size and which had no
   existing species-specific model (A. amabilis, A. grandis, P. monticola,
   and T. heterophylla). Most recommended models contained a crown scorch
   term and either a cambium injury term or a bark beetle infestation term.
   New post fire mortality thresholds were developed for A. amabilis, A.
   concolor, A. grandis, P. contorta, P. lambertiana, P. monticola, P.
   engelmannii, L. occidentalis, and T. heterophylla. We were not able to
   validate or develop acceptable logistic mortality models or thresholds
   for C. nootkatensis or T. plicata. Injury to cambium and crown were both
   significant predictors in all but one set of new thresholds. The
   validation of existing models and guidelines allows managers to
   determine which models will likely perform best and identifies knowledge
   gaps where no adequate models exist to predict post-fire tree mortality.
   The new logistic regression models and threshold guidelines provide
   improved accuracy, with simpler application for fire and forest
   management. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland encroachment
   has imperiled a broad ecological domain of the sagebrush steppe
   (Artemisia spp.) ecosystem in the Great Basin Region, USA. As these
   conifers increase in dominance on sagebrush rangelands, understory
   vegetation declines and ecohydrologic function can shift from biotic
   (vegetation) controlled retention of soil resources to abiotic (runoff)
   driven loss of soil resources and long-term site degradation.
   Scientists, public land management agencies, and private land owners are
   challenged with selecting and predicting outcomes to treatment
   alternatives to improve ecological structure and function on these
   rangelands. This study is the first of a two-part study to evaluate
   effectiveness of prescribed fire to re-establish sagebrush steppe
   vegetation and improve ecohydrologic function on mid- to late-succession
   pinyon-and juniper-encroached sagebrush sites in the Great Basin. We
   used a suite of vegetation and soil measures, small-plot (0.5 m(2) )
   rainfall simulations, and overland flow experiments (9 m(2) ) to
   quantify the effects of tree removal by prescribed fire on vegetation,
   soils, and rainsplash, sheetflow, and concentrated flow hydrologic and
   erosion processes at two woodlands 9-yr after burning. For untreated
   conditions, extensive bare interspace (87\% bare ground) throughout the
   degraded intercanopy (69-88\% bare ground) between trees at both sites
   promoted high runoff and sediment yield from combined rainsplash and
   sheetflow (similar to 45 mm, 59-381 g m(-2) ) and concentrated flow
   (371-501 L, 2343-3015 g) processes during high intensity rainfall
   simulation (102 mm h(-1) , 45 min) and overland flow experiments (15,
   30, and 45 L min(-1) , 8 min each). Burning increased canopy cover of
   native perennial herbaceous vegetation by > 5-fold, on average, across
   both sites over nine growing seasons. Burning reduced low pre-fire
   sagebrush canopy cover ( < 1\% to 14\% average) at both sites and
   sagebrush recovery is expected to take > 30 yr. Enhanced herbaceous
   cover in interspaces post-fire reduced runoff and sediment yield from
   high intensity rainfall simulations by > 2-fold at both sites.
   Fire-induced increases in herbaceous canopy cover (from 34\% to 62\%)
   and litter ground cover (from 15\% to 36\%) reduced total runoff (from
   501 L to 180 L) and sediment yield (from 2343 g to 115 g) from
   concentrated flow experiments in the intercanopy at one site. Sparser
   herbaceous vegetation (49\% cover) and litter cover (8\%) in the
   intercanopy at the other, more degraded site post-fire resulted in no
   significant reduction of total runoff (371 L to 266 L) and sediment
   yield (3015 g to 1982 g) for concentrated flow experiments. Areas
   underneath unburned shrub and tree canopies were well covered by
   vegetation and ground cover and generated limited runoff and sediment.
   Fire impacts on vegetation, ground cover, and runoff and sediment
   delivery from tree and shrub plots were highly variable. Burning litter
   covered areas underneath trees reduced perennial herbaceous vegetation
   and increased invasibility to the fire-prone annual cheatgrass (Bromus
   tectorum L.). Cheatgrass cover increased from < 1\% prefire to 16-30\%,
   on average, post-fire across the sites and was primarily restricted to
   areas around burned trees. High herbaceous cover (73\%) under burned
   trees at the less degraded site resulted in similar low total runoff and
   sediment from concentrated flow experiments as prefire (136-228 L,
   204-423 g).
   In contrast, fire-reduction of litter (from 79\% to 49\%) resulted in
   increased total runoff (from 103 L to 333 L) and sediment yield (from
   619 g to 2170 g) from concentrated flow experiments in burned tree areas
   at the more degraded site. The experimental results demonstrate pinyon
   and juniper removal by prescribed fire can effectively re-establish a
   successional trajectory towards sagebrush steppe vegetation structure
   and thereby improve ecohydrologic function. Responses to burning at the
   more degraded site suggest results should be interpreted with caution
   however. Although burning substantially increased perennial grass cover
   and reduced fine-scale runoff and erosion at the more degraded site,
   poor sagebrush recovery, delayed litter recruitment, and persistent high
   concentrated flow erosion at that site suggest not all sites are good
   candidates for prescribed fire treatments. Furthermore, high levels of
   cheatgrass in burned tree areas (similar to 30\% of area) at both sites
   increases wildfire risk, but cheatgrass is expected to decline over time
   in absence of fire. Our results in context with the literature suggest
   fire-surrogate tree-removal treatments (e.g., tree cutting or shredding)
   may be more appropriate on degraded sites with limited pre-treatment
   sagebrush and perennial herbaceous vegetation and that seeding may be
   necessary to improve post-fire establishment of sagebrush steppe
   vegetation structure and associated ecohydrologic function under these
   conditions. Lastly, vegetation, runoff, and erosion responses in this
   study are not directly applicable outside of the Great Basin, but
   similar responses in woodland studies from the southwestern US suggest
   potential application of results to woodlands in that region. The
   concept of re-establishing vegetation structure to improve ecohydrologic
   function is broadly applicable to sparsely vegetated lands around the
   World.}},

   The influence of fire regimes on resprouting shrubs is known for a range
   of species in coastal regions of Australia but is poorly known in
   montane sclerophyll communities. The fire responses of three Proteaceae
   shrubs (Banksia spinulosa, Hakea laevipes, Petrophile canescens) and a
   grasstree (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) were measured after the wildfire of
   2002 to determine whether: 1) storage organ size was related to
   post-fire growth and flowering response, 2) fire frequency influences
   post-fire mortality and if survival was related to the size of plant; 3)
   fire frequency influences the resprouting ability of plants, and 4) fire
   frequency affects pyrogenic flowering in the post-fire environment. We
   found the size of storage organs was positively related to post-fire
   sprouting in the three shrubs and to flowering in the grasstree.
   However, high fire frequency only affected the survival of Banksia
   spinulosa and decreased flowering in Xonthorrhoea johnsonii. Survival in
   all species ranged between 83 and 99\% and it appears that the intervals
   between fires (7-22 years) had been sufficient for most adult plants to
   regain the ability to resprout. The ability of juvenile plants to
   develop the ability to resprout needs to be tested on seedlings that
   established after recent fires.}},

Abstract = {{During the last few decades, the number of forest fires has been
   increasing in the Mediterranean Basin due to several factors, among
   others global warming. Large burned areas are promoting a higher number
   of naturally regenerated stands which are being poorly managed in
   general, causing the risk of new wildfires to increase. The most
   important conifer in dry areas is Pinus halepensis Mill., a well-adapted
   species to fire-prone habitats due to its high post-fire seeding
   capacity.
   High seedling density in the regenerated areas produces high
   inter-specific competition, which could induce low cone production
   related to an insufficient amount of seeds stored in the canopy for
   post-fire recolonization (immaturity risk); adequate young pine tree
   stand management is therefore required, mainly based on thinning and
   pruning.
   In this study different thinning intensities, with and without pruning,
   were tested in two Aleppo pine post-fire regenerated areas at 5 and 10
   years after a fire event. Significant relationships between seed and
   cone characteristics to site, treatment, cone age and cone type were
   found. Also the relatively little importance of Aleppo pine seeds in the
   soil seed bank was checked. The optimal management strategies for Aleppo
   pine forests in good site quality 5 years after fire was a final density
   of 1600 trees ha(-1) (plus pruning after 5 years) or 800 trees ha(-1) as
   well as a final density of 800 trees ha(-1) plus pruning after 10 years.
   In poor site quality, the best method was no treatment or thinning to
   1600 trees ha(-1) 5 years after fire plus pruning after another 5 years.
   This management policy can produce benefits in the reproductive
   processes of Aleppo pine after fire regeneration, as it shortens the
   juvenile phase and promotes a higher amount of closed cones stored in
   the canopy, thus increasing the canopy seed bank and reducing the
   immaturity risk. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Escalating wildfire in subalpine forests with stand-replacing fire
   regimes is increasing the extent of early-seral forests throughout the
   western USA. Post-fire succession generates the fuel for future fires,
   but little is known about fuel loads and their variability in young
   post-fire stands. We sampled fuel profiles in 24-year-old post-fire
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands (n = 82) that
   regenerated from the 1988 Yellowstone Fires to answer three questions.
   (1) How do canopy and surface fuel loads vary within and among young
   lodgepole pine stands? (2) How do canopy and surface fuels vary with
   pre-and post-fire lodgepole pine stand structure and environmental
   conditions? (3) How have surface fuels changed between eight and 24
   years post-fire? Fuel complexes varied tremendously across the landscape
   despite having regenerated from the same fires. Available canopy fuel
   loads and canopy bulk density averaged 8.5 Mg/ha (range 0.0-46.6) and
   0.24 kg/m(3) (range: 0.0-2.3), respectively, meeting or exceeding levels
   in mature lodgepole pine forests. Total surface-fuel loads averaged 123
   Mg/ha (range: 43-207), and 88\% was in the 1,000-h fuel class. Litter,
   1-h, and 10-h surface fuel loads were lower than reported for mature
   lodgepole pine forests, and 1,000-h fuel loads were similar or greater.
   Among-plot variation was greater in canopy fuels than surface fuels, and
   within-plot variation was greater than among-plot variation for nearly
   all fuels. Post-fire lodgepole pine density was the strongest positive
   predictor of canopy and fine surface fuel loads. Pre-fire successional
   stage was the best predictor of 100-h and 1,000-h fuel loads in the
   post-fire stands and strongly influenced the size and proportion of
   sound logs (greater when late successional stands had burned) and rotten
   logs (greater when early successional stands had burned). Our data
   suggest that 76\% of the young post-fire lodgepole pine forests have
   1,000-h fuel loads that exceed levels associated with high-severity
   surface fire potential, and 63\% exceed levels associated with active
   crown fire potential. Fire rotations in Yellowstone National Park are
   predicted to shorten to a few decades and this prediction cannot be
   ruled out by a lack of fuels to carry repeated fires.}},

Abstract = {{Snags are important components of wildlife habitat, providing nesting
   and feeding sites for over 75 species of animals in the southwestem
   United States. Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of
   snags to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating snags. Our
   objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed
   snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona
   and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We
   established six 1-ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in
   northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 {[}H96] and Pumpkin fire of
   2000 {[}P00]) to determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by
   wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison,
   six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned
   plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and
   measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in
   unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H96 fire, and 1010 snags (996
   in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the POO fire. We
   remeasured characteristics of all snags in 2003. Most burned snags were
   standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41\% had fallen.
   Snags in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and
   remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still
   standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density
   of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha(-1)) and
   unburned (2.2 ha(-1)) plots, even though burned areas produced much
   higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were
   most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with
   broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that in
   ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags
   is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin. If salvage
   logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest,
   retaining straight, large diameter snags in clumps will help maintain
   snags for cavity-excavating species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The subject of conifer regeneration failure after canopy removing
   disturbance leading to expansion of ericaceous heaths in boreal forests
   received considerable attention. However, despite seedbed quality being
   a key factor in tree regeneration, our understanding of the role of
   lichen and moss dominated seedbeds on tree seedling regeneration after
   forest fires remains unclear. Objective of this study was to investigate
   the effect of time since fire and post-fire cryptogamic (lichen and
   moss) seedbeds with variable organic matter thickness on black spruce
   regeneration. We conducted black spruce seeding experiment in black
   spruce - Kalmia forests burned 11, 17 and 37 years ago. In each site we
   applied three seedbed manipulation treatments (mat-intact, mat-mixed and
   mat-removed) to test if seedbed manipulation improves spruce
   regeneration. This experiment was extended to three moss-dominated
   seedbeds to compare seedbed moisture and temperature effects on spruce
   regeneration. We also tested potential allelopathic effect of two common
   lichen and moss species in laboratory bioassay. Seed regeneration was
   low in all seedbeds. Black spruce germination and seedling growth was
   lowest in presence of Cladonia cristatella followed by C. stellaris,
   Polytrichum juniperinnum and Pleurozium schriberi. HPLC analysis of C.
   cristatella indicated the presence of usnic acid, a common germination
   inhibiting allelochemical. Moss seedbeds were relatively favourable for
   spruce regeneration. We conclude that (i) lichen seedbeds inhibit
   seedling regeneration due to adverse biophysical and chemical
   (allelopathic) effects, (ii) moss seedbeds facilitate black spruce
   regeneration by maintaining favourable moisture and temperature, and
   (iii) seedbed manipulation treatments produce mixed results depending on
   the dominant cryptogam, organic matter thickness and seedbed moisture

Pages = {{12-25}},
Abstract = {{Although resprouting is recognized as a key post-disturbance response
   for plants, few studies have closely examined post-fire growth responses
   of resprouting species. Following a prescribed burn in Florida scrub, we
   compared intraspecific and interspecific growth patterns of 16
   resprouting shrub species. We then examined how resprouting growth is
   related to species life history strategies to understand how the
   resprouting response could contribute to niche differentiation and
   species coexistence. We defined growth by calculating relative growth
   rates based on height, crown area, and crown volume of resprouts. In
   addition, we measured the number, diameter, and height of all
   resprouting stems. The number and diameter of all stems present before
   fire were also estimated. The number of resprouting stems after the fire
   was higher than the number of stems present before the fire for all
   species. As expected, species varied significantly in their post-fire
   growth rates, especially between those with differing recovery modes.
   Resprouting shrubs that are also post-fire seeders had the lowest growth
   rates compared to those that resprout and grow clonally, those that only
   resprout, and palmettos. We also found differences in post-fire growth
   among species with different growth forms, with palmettos having the
   fastest growth, followed by shrubs, and then by sub-shrubs. Within
   species, tradeoffs were found between height and the density of new
   stems, but not between height and diameter of resprouting stems.
   Overall, Florida scrub species exhibit a continuum of post-fire growth
   rates, suggesting the coexistence of a number of successful strategies
   for post-fire resprouting rather than a single optimal recovery
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Burn severity strongly influences post-fire vegetation succession, soil
   erosion, and wildlife populations in the fire-adapted boreal forest and
   tundra ecosystems of Alaska. Therefore, satellite-derived maps of burn
   severity in the remote Alaskan landscape are a useful tool in both fire
   and resource management practices. To assess satellite-derived measures
   of burn severity in Alaska we calculated the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)
   from pre- and post-fire Landsat TM/ETM+ data. We established 289
   composite burn index (CBI) plots in or near four national park areas
   between 2001 and 2003 in order to compare ground-based measurements of
   burn severity with satellite-derived values of burn severity. Within the
   diverse vegetation types measured, a strong linear relationship between
   a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and CBI for eight out of the
   nine fire assessments was found; R-2 values ranged from 0.45 to 0.88.
   The variations in severity among four pre- fire vegetation types were
   examined and a significant difference in the average dNBR and average
   CBI values among the vegetation types was found. Black spruce forests
   overall had the strongest relationship with dNBR, while the high
   severity white spruce forests had the poorest fit with dNBR. Deciduous
   forests and tall shrub plots had the lowest average remotely sensed burn
   severity (dNBR), but not the lowest ground severity among the vegetation
   types sampled. The tundra vegetation sampled had the lowest ground
   severity. Finally, a significant difference was detected between initial
   and extended assessments of dNBR in tundra vegetation types. The results
   indicated that the dNBR can be used as an effective means to map burn
   severity in boreal forest and tundra ecosystems for the climatic
   conditions and fire types that occurred in our study sites.}},

Abstract = {{Six large wildfires have burned in Mesa Verde National Park during the

   non-native plant species. The most threatening weed species include
   Carduus nutans, Cirsium arvense, and Bromus tectorum, and if untreated,

   distribution to identify plant communities most vulnerable to post-fire
   weed invasion and created a spatially explicit model to predict the most
   vulnerable sites. At the scale of the entire park, mature pinon-juniper
   woodlands growing on two soil series were most vulnerable to post-fire
   weed invasion; mountain shrublands were the least vulnerable. At a finer
   scale, greater richness of native species was correlated with greater
   numbers of non-native species, indicating that habitats with high native
   biodiversity are at the greatest risk of weed invasion. In unburned
   areas, weed density increased with greater soil nitrogen and phosphorus,
   and lower salinity. In burned areas weed density correlated with soil
   nitrogen status and textural class. We also evaluated the effectiveness
   of a variety of weed. mitigation methods; aerial seeding of targeted

Abstract = {{At ca. 40-degrees-S in northern Patagonia, Andean rain forests are
   replaced eastwards by woodlands and shrublands and eventually by steppe.
   Along this gradient we examined stand dynamics by analyzing tree
   population age structures and tree growth patterns. We also examined
   spatial and temporal characteristics of disturbance regimes by dating
   disturbances and mapping stands of differing disturbance history. From
   west to east, the ecological importance of earthquake-related
   disturbance decreases, whereas that of fire, logging, and livestock
   increases. Abrupt changes in rates of tree growth correspond with
   earthquakes in 1837, 1939 and 1960. In the mesic western forests
   earthquakes can result in massive new tree establishment on
   landslide-affected sites and increased rates of treefall.
   Fire, however, is the more pervasive disturbance over most of the
   gradient and creates extensive even-aged patches dominated by the
   regionally dominant trees, Nothofagus and Austrocedrus. Although some
   lightning-ignited and aboriginal-set fires occurred in these forests
   prior to European settlement, much of the present forest structure may
   be attributed to the massive burning associated with European settlement
   of this area near the turn of the present century. In contrast to the
   settlement-related increase in fire frequency in the western forested
   district, at the woodland/steppe ecotone the demise of the native
   American population resulted in a decrease in fire frequency. Heavy
   browsing and grazing following fire can seriously impede post-fire tree
   regeneration. These preliminary results document the important
   influences of varying disturbance regimes along a major environmental
   gradient in creating landscape-scale vegetation patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The study of plant functional types (PFTs) has been widely emphasized
   when analysing plant community changes in relation to variations in
   climate and disturbance regime. In this study, we search for PFTs of
   woody species near forest-grassland boundaries in South Brazil where,
   due to climate, forests tend to expand over grassland but are being
   restricted by frequent fires. We aimed at answering the questions: (i)
   which plant functional types of forest woody species can establish in
   adjacent grassland subject to fire disturbance and (ii) which plant
   functional types of forest and grassland woody species are related to
   short-term community dynamics in frequently burned grassland. Traits
   were assessed in woody plants in 156 plots (6.75 m(2)) arranged in 12
   transects across forest-grassland boundaries with different fire history
   in their grassland part. The analysis used a recursive algorithm to
   search for traits and PFTs maximally associated to spatial distance from
   forest limit in one analysis, and elapsed time since last fire in
   another. As a result, nine PFTs of forest woody species were identified
   that best described community patterns associated to distance from
   forest. Resprouting ability characterized forest plants able to colonize
   grasslands. PFT diversity was higher in border plots than inside forest
   or grassland. Four PFTs of forest and grassland woody species best
   described woody species community patterns in the grassland associated
   to elapsed time since fire. Taller individuals of single-stemmed shrubs
   predominated in late post-fire recovery (3-4 years), while shorter
   multi-stemmed shrubs in recently burned areas (3 months to 1 year). PFTs
   of forest trees occurred in border plots or, as established adults, in
   grassland, remaining unaffected by fire. We conclude that easily
   measurable structural plant traits, such as those used in our study, are
   sufficient to evaluate post-fire community dynamics. Forest PFTs in
   burned grassland are restricted to those with resprouting ability to
   survive recurrent fire events. Establishment success is highest on
   protected sites with lesser or low-intensity fire.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified the post-fire recovery of the endangered Eastern
   Bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus) at Booderee National Park,
   south-eastern Australia. Occurrence was recorded on 110 sites a year
   before, and for 3 years after a major unplanned fire in 2003. Although
   the Eastern Bristlebird is thought to be sensitive to wildfire, data
   indicated that the species either persisted continuously on burned sites
   or returned to previously occupied sites within 2 years. Post-fire site
   occupancy was associated with several factors: (1) pre-fire site
   occupancy; (2) vegetation type; (3) spatial heterogeneity in fire and
   the amount of unburned vegetation surrounding a site; and (4) site-level
   vegetation structure (e. g. diversity of understorey and midstorey
   plants). The most likely mechanism underpinning rapid re-occupancy was
   movement by resident birds to unburned parts elsewhere within their
   territories. The addition of intensive feral predator baiting within the
   present study suggests that predation may have a more important effect
   on populations after unplanned fires than formerly recognised. Our
   results have significant implications for fire management in areas where
   the Eastern Bristlebird occurs. Care should be taken with back-burning
   during unplanned fires and the spatial and temporal arrangement of
   prescribed fires to ensure unburned vegetation remains as refugia to

   likelihood of non-native species establishment. In the present study we
   examine the establishment of non-native species after wildfires in
   relation to native species richness, fire severity, dominant native
   plant cover, resource availability, and pre- and post-fire management
   actions (fuel treatments and post-fire rehabilitation treatments). We
   used an information-theoretic approach to compare alternative
   hypotheses. We analysed post-fire effects at multiple scales at three
   wildfires in Colorado and New Mexico. For large and small spatial scales
   at all fires, fire severity was the most consistent predictor of
   non-native species cover. Non-native species cover was also correlated
   with high native species richness, low native dominant species cover,
   and high seeded grass cover. There was a positive, but non-significant,
   association of non-native species with fuel-treated areas at one
   wildfire. While there may be some potential for fuels treatments to
   promote non-native species establishment, wildfire and post-fire seeding
   treatments seem to have a larger impact on non-native species.}},

Abstract = {{In Cerrado, studies of post-fire vegetation recovery show that some

   forests that border the savannas in Central Brazil. Thus, an accidental
   burning gave us the opportunity to describe the reproductive activity of
   the ground layer vegetation after a fire event along a savanna-forest
   boundary at the IBGE Ecological Reserve, Brasilia, Brazil. During the
   16-month of the inventory, we registered 170 herbaceous species
   flowering or fruiting, of which 52 species (31\%) may have been
   influenced by fire that changed their times of reproduction. In the
   savanna plots reproduction peaked at the end of the rainy season. Of the
   total number of reproducing species, 90 species occurred only in the
   savanna and four in the forest. Five herbs were recorded in the forest,
   savanna and border environments. Late dry season fire probably lead the

   on burned landscapes 6 years post-fire with 81, 86, and 42 \% less shrub

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires play a determining role in the composition and structure of
   many plant and animal communities. On the other hand, climate change is
   considered to be a major driver of current and future fire regime
   changes. Despite increases in drought in many areas of the world, the
   effects of aridity on post-fire colonization by animals have been rarely
   addressed. This study aims to analyse how a regional aridity gradient
   affects post-fire recovery of vegetation, bird species richness and the
   numbers of four early to middle-successional warbler species associated
   with the shrub cover. The database contains bird relative abundance and
   environmental variables from 3072 censuses in 695 transects located in
   70 recently burnt areas (1 to 11 years after wildfire) in Catalonia
   (Spain), which were sampled between 2006 and 2013. Generalized linear
   mixed models (GLMMs) showed that plant cover was affected by time since
   fire, aridity and forest management. However, only the highest
   vegetation height layer (>100 cm) recovered slower in arid areas after
   fire. Time since fire positively influenced bird species richness and
   the relative abundance of the four focal species. The post-fire recovery
   of Melodious (Hippolais polyglotta) and Subalpine warblers (Sylvia
   cantillans) was hampered by aridity. Although this was not demonstrated
   for Dartford (S. undata) and Sardinian warblers (S. melanocephala),
   their occurrence was low in the driest areas during the first three
   years after fire. Overall, this study suggests that future increases in
   aridity can affect plant regeneration after fire and slow down the
   recovery of animal populations that depend on understorey and
   shrublands. Given the recently highlighted increases in aridity and fire
   frequency in Mediterranean-climate regions, improved knowledge on how
   aridity affects ecological succession is especially necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Intense debate surrounds the effects of post-fire salvage logging (SL)

   pine (Pinus pinaster) at a Mediterranean mountain. Treatments were
   applied 7 months after the fire and differ in the degree of
   intervention, ranging from ``no intervention{''} (NI, all trees left
   standing) to ``partial cut plus lopping{''} (PCL, felling most of the
   trees, cutting the main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ
   without mastication), and ``SL{''} (felling and piling the logs, and
   masticating the woody debris). Seedling survival after 3 years was the
   highest in PCL (47.3\% versus 38.7\% in SL). This was associated with
   the amelioration of microclimatic conditions under the scattered
   branches, which reduced radiation and soil temperature while increasing
   soil moisture. Seedling density after 2 years was approximately 5.5
   times higher in PCL than in SL, as in SL a large fraction of seedlings
   was lost as a consequence of mechanized mastication. The NI treatment
   showed the lowest seedling survival (17.3\%). Nevertheless, seedling
   density was similar to SL. Seedling growth scarcely differed among
   treatments. Our results show that branches left onsite acted as nurse
   objects that improved key microclimatic conditions for seedling
   recruitment. This creates a facilitative interaction ideal for seedling
   establishment in moisture-deficient ecosystems, as it provides the
   benefit of a shading overstory but without underground competition.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, fire regimes have been modified by various factors

   tree recruitment dynamics to burn severity 5 years after a wildfire. Our
   results conclude that in the short term, Pinus halepensis Mill. stands

   in areas burned with low severity. We observed that moderate and high
   severities affected the ecosystem more significantly, showing higher
   values for the Shannon Index but lower for the Simpson index. Pine
   recruitment was higher in burned areas, and we found the highest number
   of Aleppo pine seedlings under a moderate burn severity. Post-fire
   regeneration functional groups (obligate seeders and resprouters) were
   promoted under moderate and high burn severity, increasing their
   abundance. Annual species (mainly herbs) colonized burned areas,
   persisting with higher presence under moderate burn severity.
   Restoration tools should be focused on reducing fire severity, mainly in

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{461}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{We used a chronosequence approach to investigate the relationship
   between existing conditions of forested land that burned at some point
   between 1984 and 2014 in western Montana and the abundances of various
   bird species based on 7533 point-counts. Twelve of 68 bird species
   occurred significantly more frequently in burned mixed-conifer forest
   than in any of 13 unburned vegetation types, and most of them reached
   their greatest abundance in the severely burned portions of those
   forests. After restricting the analysis to conifer forest types only, 33
   of 68 species (49\%) were significantly more abundant in burned forest
   at some combination of time-since-fire and fire severity than in
   unburned conifer forest. One species, the black-backed woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus), occurred nearly exclusively in severely and
   recently burned mixed-conifer forests. Its restricted distribution
   suggests that it must have evolved in the presence of those
   burned-forest conditions and, therefore, that it accurately reflects
   historical post-fire conditions that are critical to maintain on the
   landscape. This disturbance-dependent species was also affected strongly
   and negatively by both pre-fire and post-fire tree harvesting. Two
   important management implications follow directly from these findings:
   (1) the presence of the full complement of bird species in a landscape
   cannot be maintained through land management that either suppresses fire
   or acts to reduce overall fire severity through widespread forest
   thinning or through the application of homogeneous, low-severity,
   prescribed burning across the broader landscape-only severe fire can
   produce the variety of post-fire conditions used by species that are
   nowhere more abundant than in burned forests; and (2) the presence of
   many species (especially those most specialized to use burned forest
   conditions) is incompatible with both pre-fire and post-fire timber
   harvesting. To maintain the ecological integrity of

Abstract = {{Resilience to fire of a Shrew population (Crocidura suaveolens) was
   studied in a post-fire East Mediterranean pine forest on Mount Carmel,
   Israel. Since they are small body size secondary consumers, shrews can
   serve as bioindicators for assessing the various stages of post-fire
   recovery. Shrew abundance was correlated with abiotic and biotic
   variables. An attempt was also made to discover the response of
   population recovery under different postfire forest treatments: ``burned
   control{''} - untreated post fire plots; ``burned and clear{''} whereby
   burned pine trees and twigs are removed from the plots; ``burned and
   twigs{''} - whereby burned pine trees are removed but the twigs are kept
   accumulated in situ. Within two and a half years since fire, shrew
   population had established itself in all treatments. Activity was high
   in ambient temperatures close to their thermoneutral zone and at
   relatively high humidity. Only in burned control plots shrew populations
   correlated positively with the height of Pinus halepensis and Cistus
   salviifolius. Abundance was negatively correlated with the abundance of
   Mus macedonicus and positively correlated with that of Gerbillus
   dasyurus and Apodemus mystacinus. Time since fire rather than treatments
   is the most important factor in the recovery after fire of the shrew
   population, but seasonality seems to play an important role in shrew
   abundance as well.}},

Abstract = {{Massive tree-felling due to root damage is a common fire effect on burnt
   areas in Scandinavia, but has so far not been analyzed in detail. Here
   we explore if pre- and post-fire lidar data can be used to estimate the
   proportion of fallen trees. The study was carried out within a large
   (14,000 ha) area in central Sweden burnt in August 2014, where we had
   access to airborne lidar data from both 2011 and 2015. Three data-sets
   of predictor variables were tested: POST (post-fire lidar metrics), D1F
   (difference between post- and pre-fire lidar metrics) and combination of
   those two (POST\_DIF). Fractional logistic regression was used to
   predict the proportion of fallen trees. Training data consisted of 61
   plots, where the number of fallen and standing trees was calculated both
   in the field and with interpretation of drone images. The accuracy of
   the best model was tested based on 100 randomly selected validation
   plots with a size of 25 x 25 m.
   Our results showed that multi-temporal lidar together with
   field-collected training data can be used for quantifying post-fire tree
   felling over large areas. Several height-, density- and intensity
   metrics correlated with the proportion of fallen trees. The best model
   combined metrics from both datasets (POST DIF), resulting in a RMSE of
   0.11. Results were slightly poorer in the validation plots with RMSE of
   0.18 using pixel size of 12.5 m and RMSE of 0.15 using pixel size of
   6.25 m. Our model performed least well for stands that had been exposed
   to high-intensity crown fire. This was likely due to the low amount of
   echoes from the standing black tree skeletons. Wall-to-wall maps
   produced with this model can be used for landscape level analysis of
   fire effects and to explore the relationship between fallen trees and
   forest structure, soil type, fire intensity or topography.}},

Abstract = {{Fire and herbivory are important disturbances in vegetation globally.
   These disturbances are widely applied in combination for conservation

   of their influences between vegetation types. At seven sites in
   Tasmania, Australia, in sedgeland, heathy forest and grassland, the
   covers and heights of tracheophytes were measured before and for 2 years
   after the commencement of a fire experiment that nested grazing within
   burning. Burning followed by grazing, largely by native vertebrates,
   tended to result in greater changes in species and lifeform composition
   than either grazing by itself or burning by itself. Heathy forest and
   sedgeland responded primarily to fire rather than grazing. Heathy forest
   shifted to a new state with burning while sedgeland began a return to
   its pre-burn state. Grazing after burning most strongly affected the
   lowland tussock grassland, while also strongly influencing the height of
   highland tussock grasslands. Intact canopies in eucalypt forest after

Abstract = {{Forest fires are a regular occurrence in the Mediterranean basin. High
   severity fires and post-fire management can affect biological, chemical
   and physical properties of soil, including the composition and abundance
   of soil microbial communities. Salvage logging is a post-fire management
   strategy, which involves the removal of burnt wood from land after a
   fire. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of
   post-fire salvage logging and microaggregation on soil microbial
   communities, specifically on the abundance of nitrogen cyclers and,
   thus, the potential of the soil for microbial nitrogen cycling. The
   abundance of nitrogen cyclers was assessed by quantification of
   microbial nitrogen cycling genes in soil DNA, including nifH (involved
   in nitrogen fixation), nirS/K and nosZ (involved in denitrification),
   amoA-B and amoA-Arch (involved in bacterial and archaeal nitrification,
   respectively). It was demonstrated that salvage logging reduced
   bacterial load post-fire when compared to tree retention control and
   resulted in significant changes to the abundance of functional bacteria
   involved in nitrogen cycling. Microbial gene pools involved in various
   stages of the nitrogen cycle were larger in control soil than in soil
   subjected to post-fire salvage logging and were significantly correlated
   with organic matter, available phosphorous, nitrogen and aggregate
   stability. The microaggregate fraction of the soil, which has been
   associated with greater organic carbon, was shown to be a hotspot for
   nitrogen cyclers particularly under salvage logging. The impact of
   post-fire management strategies on soil microbial communities needs to
   be considered in relation to maintaining ecosystem productivity,
   resilience and potential impact on climate change. (c) 2017 Elsevier

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Salvage logging after disturbances in forests substantially modifies
   vegetation structure and dead wood availability, but empirical evidence
   on its impact on biodiversity, especially in European boreal forest, is
   sparse. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire
   salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently
   burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local
   species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites
   (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after
   a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and
   Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at
   non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that
   rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major,
   Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula),
   mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides
   tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while
   species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as
   whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed
   shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more
   common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea
   that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird
   species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that
   although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring
   in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species
   richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical
   forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation
   concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging
   in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing
   management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate
   long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked
   conifer stands. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2007, the USDA Forest Service's Remote Sensing Applications Center
   (RSAC) has been producing fire severity data within the first 30 to 45
   days after wildfire containment (i.e., initial assessments {[}IA]), for
   wildfires that occur on USDA Forest Service managed lands, to support
   post-fire management actions. Satellite image-derived map products are
   produced using calibrations of the relativized differenced normalized
   burn ratio (RdNBR) to the Composite Burn Index (CBI), percent change in
   tree basal area (BA), and percent change in canopy cover (CC).
   Calibrations for extended assessments (EA) based upon one-year post-fire
   images have previously been published. Given that RdNBR is sensitive to
   ash cover, which declines with time since fire, RdNBR values that
   represent total mortality can be different immediately post fire
   compared with one year post fire. Therefore, new calibrations are
   required for IAs. In this manuscript, we describe how we modified the EA
   calibrations to be used for IAs using an adjustment factor to account
   for changes in ash cover computed through regression of IA and EA Rd-NBR
   values. We evaluate whether the accuracy of IA and EA maps are
   significantly different using ground measurements of live and dead
   trees, and CBI taken one year post fire in 11 fires in the Sierra Nevada
   and northwestern California. We compare differences between error
   matrices using Z-tests of Kappa statistics and differences between mean
   plot values in mapped categories using Generalized Linear Models (GLM).
   We also investigate whether map accuracy is dependent upon plot distance
   from boundaries delineating mapped categories. The IAs and EAs produced
   similarly accurate broad-scale estimates of tree mortality. Between IAs
   and EAs of each severity metric, the Kappa statistics of error matrices
   were not significantly different (P > 0.674) nor were mean plot values
   within mapped categories (P > 0.077). Plots <30 m (one Landsat pixel)
   distance from mapped polygon boundaries were less accurate than plots >=
   30 m inside mapped polygons (P < 0.001). As land managers concentrate
   most post-fire management actions where tree mortality is high, it is
   desirable for map accuracy of severely burned areas to be high. Plots
   that were >= 30 m inside polygons depicting >= 75 \% or >= 90 \% BA
   mortality were correctly classified (producer's accuracy) >92.3 \% of
   the time, regardless of IA or EA.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing wildfire activity is one of the most pressing management
   concerns in arid lands of the American West. To examine post-fire
   recovery of perennial vegetation in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts, I
   analyzed data systematically synthesized from the literature. Post-fire
   sprouting by desert perennials is generally limited but varies among
   species. For example, only 3-37\% of Larrea tridentata sprouted compared
   to 64-86\% of Yucca schidigera. Four of five studies measuring recovery
   of perennial cover reported close relationships (r(2) = 0.67-0.99)
   between time since fire (TSF) and cover. In fact, three studies
   measuring the longest TSF (>= 37 years) found that cover had returned to
   within 10\% cover of unburned areas within approximately 40 years.
   Conversely, post-fire species composition exhibited little convergence
   with unburned composition in five of six studies even 47 years after
   fire. Sphaeralcea ambigua, Gutierrezia spp., Achnatherum speciosum,
   Encelia spp., Hymenoclea salsola, and Baileya multiradiata had the
   highest burned: unburned abundance ratios, although overall post-fire
   community composition differed between the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts.
   Analyzing the literature as a whole suggested some generalities (e.g.,
   that perennial cover reestablishes faster than composition), but more
   work is required for improving specific knowledge about plant recovery
   among fires, sites, species, and climates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fire is widely recognized as an important natural disturbance agent
   impacting ecosystems throughout the world. Post-fire vegetation dynamics
   and subsequent management implications substantially differ in each
   region. Because north central Maine is believed to have a long return
   interval fire regime (at least 800 years according to Lorimer {[}1977]),
   the threat of catastrophic fire in one's lifetime seems remote. However,
   with an apposite synergy of events, historical evidence supports that
   severe fires can and do occur in this region. A series of interacting
   disturbance events occurred in Baxter State Park in Maine offering an
   excellent opportunity to study long-term changes in vegetation. In July
   of 1977, 1439 hectares in and adjacent to Baxter State Park experienced
   a severe forest fire. Much of the fire burned areas that were blown down
   in a 1974 windstorm; some of these areas were salvaged prior to the
   fire, while others were not. Sandra Hansen (1983) set up plots to
   represent the various stand conditions and measured vegetation
   composition and structure a year following the fire. The current study
   will re-establish these plots and document vegetation structure to
   improve our understanding of forest development after disturbance.
   Specific research objectives arc to: 1) relocate the original plot
   markers, 2) describe post-fire vegetation development, and 3) evaluate
   the influence of pre-fire disturbances on the post-fire regeneration

Abstract = {{Understanding how drought affects seeder and resprouter plants during

   Mediterranean vegetation vulnerability in a context of increasing
   drought and fire caused by climate change.
   A Mediterranean shrubland was subjected to various drought treatments
   (including 45\% rainfall reduction, 7 months drought yr(-1)), before and
   after experimental burning, by means of a rainout-shelter system with an
   irrigation facility. Predawn shoot water potential (Psi(pd)), relative
   growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA) and bulk leaf carbon
   isotopic composition (delta C-13) were monitored in the main woody
   species during the first 3 yr after fire.
   Cistus ladanifer seedlings showed higher Psi(pd), RGR and SLA, and lower
   delta C-13, than unburned plants during the first two post-fire years.
   Seedlings under drought maintained relatively high Psi(pd), but suffered
   a decrease in Psi(pd) and RGR, and an increase in delta C-13, relative
   to control treatments. Erica arborea, E. scoparia and Phillyrea
   angustifolia resprouts had higher Psi(pd) and RGR than unburned plants
   during the first post-fire year. Resprouters were largely unaffected by
   drought.
   Overall, despite marked differences between the two functional groups,

Abstract = {{In the summer of 2007 an enormous wild fire occurred on Vidlie' Mt.
   (Southeast Serbia), which burned down more than 2500 ha of vegetation.
   Our aim was to study the short-term patterns of diversity changes and
   vegetation dynamics in the grasslands and rocky ground vegetation
   affected by the fire. Plots of vegetation were observed according to
   Braun-Blanquet phytosociological methods. Species richness and Simpson's
   diversity index were calculated per quadrant for each of three seasons.
   ANOVA, Unequal HSD post hoc test and Linear Regression were performed in
   order to follow the post-fire vegetation dynamics and diversity. The
   species richness and diversity of the fire-affected sites were highest
   in the zone of thermophilous oak forests, slightly lower in the
   transitional belt, and lowest in the belt of beech forests. With
   increasing altitude, the values of richness and diversity decreased.
   Considering life-forms composition, the most important influence of
   wildfire was the relationship between two most represented categories,
   hemicryptophytes and therophytes. It was concluded that the cover values
   of 13 species show comparatively high levels of statistically
   significant differences between the stages of vegetation formed in the
   post-fire period. Limestone grasslands and rocky ground vegetation
   showed quick recovery after the fire, which indicates that these
   habitats show comparatively high resilience to fire.}},

Title = {{Post-fire management regimes affect carbon sequestration and storage in
   a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{291}},
Pages = {{268-277}},

Abstract = {{Forests mitigate climate change by sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere
   and accumulating it in biomass storage pools. However, in dry conifer
   forests, fire occasionally returns large quantities of CO2 to the
   atmosphere. Both the total amount of carbon stored and its
   susceptibility to loss may be altered by post-fire land management
   strategies. Forest managers face a great challenge when asked to manage
   these lands for C sequestration and simultaneously reduce fire hazard.
   The objective of our study was to understand how differing post-fire
   management strategies affect C sequestration and the size of storage
   pools in the 10 years after a wildfire in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer
   forest. Post-fire management regimes included: (1) salvage-logged,
   planted, and intensively managed plantation (IM); (2) salvage-logged and
   planted (SP); (3) no salvage (NS); and (4) green canopy (GC), where fire
   burned through, but 95\% of the overstory trees survived. Carbon
   sequestration and storage were estimated from measurements of individual
   ecosystem carbon pools. These pools included: aboveground trees,
   saplings, snags, stumps, and understory, coarse wood and fine wood,
   duff, and soil. We found total ecosystem carbon storage was 282 +/- 15
   Mg ha(-1) of C in the NS treatment, 206 +/- 31 Mg ha(-1) in the GC, 137
   +/- 13 Mg ha(-1) in the SP, and 101 +/- 15 Mg ha(-1) in the IM
   treatment. There were no significant treatment differences in C storage
   among the pools that would constitute labile/fine fuels, but there were
   differences in recalcitrant (coarse fuel) C pools. The greatest C
   storage in recalcitrant C pools was 258 +/- 10 Mg ha(-1) in the NS and
   197 +/- 30 Mg ha(-1) in the GC treatments. Post-fire carbon
   sequestration rates were 1.6 +/- 0.7 Mg ha(-1) - year(-1) of C in the
   GC, 0.7 +/- 0.3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the SP, 0.5 +/- 0.1 Mg ha(-1)
   year(-1) in the NS, and 0.5 +/- 0.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the IM
   treatments, but these differences were not statistically significant.
   Tree carbon sequestration rates were highest in the GC treatment and
   lowest in the NS treatment. Overall, our results suggest that a mature
   green-canopy stand provides most benefit in terms of C sequestration,
   wildfire resilience, and other ecosystem services at a point 10 years
   after severe wildfire. For forests that suffer high fire mortality,
   unsalvaged (NS) stands will retain the most carbon onsite. Published by

Abstract = {{Fire represents a frequent disturbance in many ecosystems, which can
   affect plant-pollinator assemblages and hence the services they provide.
   Furthermore, fire events could affect the architecture of
   plant-pollinator interaction networks, modifying the structure and
   function of communities.
   Some pollinators, such as wood-nesting bees, may be particularly
   affected by fire events due to damage to the nesting material and its
   long regeneration time. However, it remains unclear whether fire
   influences the structure of bee-plant interactions.
   Here, we used quantitative plant-wood-nesting bee interaction networks
   sampled across four different post-fire age categories (from
   freshly-burnt to unburnt sites) in an arid ecosystem to test whether the
   abundance of wood-nesting bees, the breadth of resource use and the
   plant-bee community structure change along a post-fire age gradient.
   We demonstrate that freshly-burnt sites present higher abundances of
   generalist than specialist wood-nesting bees and that this translates
   into lower network modularity than that of sites with greater post-fire
   ages. Bees do not seem to change their feeding behaviour across the
   post-fire age gradient despite changes in floral resource availability.
   Despite the effects of fire on plant-bee interaction network structure,
   these mutualistic networks seem to be able to recover a few years after
   the fire event. This result suggests that these interactions might be
   highly resilient to this type of disturbance.}},

Title = {{What drives ponderosa pine regeneration following wildfire in the
   western United States?}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{454}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson \& C. Lawson) is a prominent tree
   species in forests of the western United States. Wildfire activity in
   ponderosa pine dominated or co-dominated forests has increased
   dramatically in recent decades, with these recent wildfires often
   burning in an uncharacteristic manner due to past land management
   activities and changing climate. The structure and function of
   vegetative communities that develop following recent wildfires are
   highly contingent on ponderosa pine regeneration, making it important
   that the factors influencing this regeneration be thoroughly understood.
   In this evidence-based review, we qualitatively synthesized publications
   that examined how the post-fire abundance of ponderosa pine regeneration
   was related to such factors. We identified 33 relevant publications,
   from which we synthesized relationships for 21 factors. Numerous
   publications indicated that distance to seed source (e.g., distance to
   nearest live overstory tree or group of trees) was a factor that clearly
   affected post-fire ponderosa pine regeneration abundance; with few
   exceptions, these publications demonstrated that as distance to seed
   source increased, the amount of regeneration decreased. Climatic stress
   (e.g., Palmer Drought Severity Index, actual evapotranspiration,
   climatic moisture deficit) and elevation also emerged as well-studied
   factors with a clear relationship to post-fire regeneration abundance.
   Specifically, areas with lower climatic stress and/or at higher
   elevations generally harbored more regeneration than areas with higher
   climatic stress and/or at lower elevations; together, these factors
   highlight that cooler, moister environments enhance regeneration. The
   other 18 factors were either well studied but did not have consistent
   relationships with regeneration abundance, or were not well studied,
   highlighting research areas that could benefit from further attention.
   Overall, the strong influence of distance to seed source, climatic
   stress, and elevation on post-fire ponderosa pine regeneration abundance
   has important implications for post-fire vegetative recovery and
   management, particularly in light of recent and predicted changes in
   wildfire activity and climate.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Extensive high-severity wildfires have driven major losses of ponderosa
   pine and mixed-conifer forests in the southwestern United States, in
   some settings catalyzing enduring conversions to non-forested vegetation
   types. Management interventions to reduce the probability of
   stand-replacing wildfire have included mechanical fuel treatments,
   prescribed fire, and wildfire managed for resource benefit. In 2011, the
   Las Conchas fire in northern New Mexico burned forested areas not
   exposed to fire for >100 yr, but also reburned numerous prescribed fire
   units and/or areas previously burned by wildfire. At some sites, the
   combination of recent prescribed fire and wildfire approximated known
   pre-settlement fire frequency, with two or three exposures to fire
   between 1977 and 2007. We analyzed gridded remotely sensed burn severity
   data (differenced normalized burn ratio), pre-and post-fire field
   vegetation samples, and pre-and post-fire measures of surface fuels to
   assess relationships and interactions between prescribed fire, prior
   wildfire, fuels, subsequent burn severity, and patterns of post-fire
   forest retention vs. conversion to non-forest. We found that Las Conchas
   burn severity was lowest, and tree survival was highest, in sites that
   had experienced both prescribed fire and prior wildfire. Sites that had
   experienced only prescribed or prior wildfire exhibited moderate burn
   severity and intermediate levels of forest retention. Sites lacking any
   recent prior fire burned at the highest severity and were overwhelmingly
   converted to non-forested vegetation including grassland, oak scrub, and
   weedy, herbaceous-dominated types. Burn severity in the Las Conchas fire
   was closely linked to surface woody fuel loads, which were reduced by
   prior wildfire and prescribed fire. Our results support the restoration
   of fire regimes via prescribed fire and resource benefit wildfire to
   promote the resiliency of forest types vulnerable to fire-mediated type
   conversion. The application of prescribed fire to reduce surface fuels
   following wildfire may reduce forest loss during subsequent fire under
   more extreme conditions. These findings are especially relevant given
   likely increases in vulnerability associated with climate change impacts
   to wildfire and forest dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires have major impacts on ecosystems globally. Fire regimes
   (including fire frequency, intensity, season and type of fire) influence
   the status of species by altering habitat suitability at the site scale,
   and by creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale. The relative
   effects of site and landscape-scale fire attributes on animal species
   are rarely examined together. Such knowledge is important, given that
   fire regimes are sensitive to changing land management practices; and
   that fires are predicted to become larger and more frequent in some
   regions as a result of climate change. Here, we tested the relative
   influence of elements of the fire regime (fire severity, fire history)
   at the site-scale, and the landscape context (extent of
   surrounding{''}unburnt forest, fire heterogeneity) on the occurrence of
   native terrestrial mammals after severe wildfire in south-eastern
   Australia. We conducted surveys by using automatically triggered,
   infrared cameras at 80 sites in fire-prone eucalypt forests, 2-3 years
   post-wildfire. Thirteen native mammal species were recorded, eight of
   which were detected with sufficient frequency for analysis. Most species
   were widespread (35-90\% of sites) and recorded in all fire severity
   classes. Fire effects at the site level were more influential than
   landscape context effects arising from heterogeneity in the fire regime
   (e.g. extent of surrounding unburnt forest). Fire severity was the most
   influential of the fire-regime elements investigated, but it affected
   different species in different ways. This study highlights three main
   points relevant to conservation of terrestrial mammals after wildfire.
   First, spatial variation in fire severity associated with wildfire
   (ranging from unburned to severely burned stands) is an important
   contributor to the post-fire status of species. Second, post-fire
   environmental conditions are significant: here, rapid regeneration of
   vegetation following drought-breaking rains greatly influenced the
   suitability of post-fire habitats. Third, it is valuable to consider the
   effects of the fire regime at multiple scales, including both the site
   (forest stand) and its landscape context. Insights from short-term
   surveys, such as this, will be enhanced by complementary longitudinal
   studies, especially where they encompass environmental variation through
   the post-fire succession. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are among the most important natural disturbances in the
   Mediterranean basin. They impose drastic habitat and landscape
   modifications that affect not only the vegetation but also vertebrate
   dynamics and structure from the population up to the community levels.
   There are a wide range of post-fire succession trajectories for
   vertebrate populations, whereas specific-species responses are dependent
   upon post-fire biotic and abiotic conditions in the burned habitat. The
   main generalization at the population level is that the burned areas
   support populations of open-and edge-habitat species, whereas the
   species most abundant in unburned woody areas are typical forest-dweller
   species that avoid open areas. Wildfires reduce habitat availability for
   forest animals, but the overall impact of fire is not necessarily
   negative from the perspective of biodiversity conservation, since it
   creates heterogeneous landscape with forest patches that support forest
   dwellers and forest-edge specialists along with open habitats that are
   critical to maintain open-habitat species. But the effect of fires in
   the Mediterranean basin on biodiversity is highly variable and dependent
   upon several factors: the extent, severity, and frequency of the fire,
   the initial state of the ecosystem, the spatial arrangement and
   isolation of the post-fire burned and unburned patches, and various
   abiotic conditions. From the management point of view, the maintenance
   of landscape mosaic habitats with different fire history is vital for

Abstract = {{Fire is a rare phenomenon in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo region of South
   Africa, but appears to have become more common in recent years, possibly
   as a result of climate change. The ecological effects of fire in this
   vegetation are poorly understood, but are likely to involve changes in
   structural composition, that of the shrub-grass ratio in particular. A
   fire burned an area of Karoo escarpment grassland (a mixture of shrubs
   and grasses) on the Nuweveld Mountains in October 2013. We assessed
   changes in plant structural composition and fire survival or persistence
   strategies of perennial shrubs at 2.5 years post fire. The canopy cover
   abundance of grasses, herbs, and dwarf shrubs increased post fire, while
   that of large shrubs decreased. Despite all large shrub species (except
   Elytropappus rhinocerotis {[}L.f.] Less.) exhibiting post-fire
   resprouting and reseeding, vigor varied widely within species. Localized
   post-fire extinctions appeared possible in many large shrub species,
   including Cliffortia arborea Marloth (Vulnerable; Raimondo et al. 2015).
   Increases in fire frequency or fire intensity are predicted to result in
   persistent negative feedbacks (the grass-fire cycle) whereby the
   herbaceous stratum would increase in dominance at the expense of larger
   woody growth forms. This process may be hindered by actions to prevent
   and suppress fires.}},

   in three burnt areas submitted to different post-fire practices, as well
   as at five sites located in peripheral unburnt pine forest. A total of
   4882 specimens belonging to 33 families, which were classified into six
   feeding groups according to their dietary preferences, were collected.
   ANOVA and Redundancy Analyses showed a taxonomic and functional response
   to fire as all burnt areas had more Hymenoptera families, different
   community composition and higher numbers of parasitoids than the unburnt
   area. Taxonomic differences were also found between burnt areas in terms
   of the response of Hymenoptera to post-fire management. In general the
   number of parasitoids was positively correlated to the number of
   potential host arthropods. Parasitoids are recognized to be sensitive to
   habitat changes, thus highlighting their value for monitoring the
   functional responses of organisms to habitat disturbance. The taxonomic
   and functional responses of Hymenoptera suggest that some pine-forest

   increasing interspecific interactions such as those established by

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus delegatensis is native to the Australian Alps (subsp.
   delegatensis) and montane Tasmania (subsp. tasmaniensis). Post-fire
   regeneration mechanisms of the obligate-seeder subspecies on the
   Australian mainland are well-known, but less is known about the
   resprouter Tasmanian subspecies. In January 2016, large tracts of
   Eucalyptus delegatensis forests in central Tasmania, logged at different
   intensities, were burnt by low- and highseverity fire. We used
   statistical modelling to understand how tree survival, vegetative
   regeneration and seedling recruitment differed according to understorey
   type, fire severity, logging intensity and tree size (DBH). Fire
   severity, defined as unburnt, low-severity (fire scarring on the stem
   and/or lower canopy burnt) and highseverity (full canopy burnt),
   affected tree survival: 84\% of trees were alive in unburnt transects,
   compared with 43\% in low-severity transects and 36\% in high-severity
   transects. Epicormic resprouting was the dominant mode of vegetative
   recovery, with < 1\% of total trees recovering solely by basal
   resprouting. Fire severity significantly affected epicormic resprouting,
   with 70\% of live stems resprouting post-fire in low-severity transects
   and 99\% in high-severity transects, compared with 4\% in unburnt
   transects. Tree survival was strongly influenced by tree size: in
   high-severity transects, 24\% of trees with DBH < 20 cm were alive,
   compared with 88\% of trees with DBH >= 20 cm. These differences in
   survival were primarily because large trees were more likely to resprout
   epicormically, with epicormic shoots present on 24\% of live trees with
   DBH < 20 cm, compared with 79\% of live trees with DBH >= 80 cm. The
   strong effect of tree size renders clear-felled forests especially
   vulnerable to fire during the several decades when all the regenerating
   trees are small (DBH < 20 cm). Seedling recruitment was uncommon,
   independent of understorey type and logging intensity, but with higher
   occurrence on high-severity (54\%) than low-severity (19\%) or unburnt
   (15\%) transects. When present, seedling densities were typically low:
   median = 400 and maximum = 4.10(4) seedlings ha(-1). This study
   highlights that mature forests of Eucalyptus delegatensis in Tasmania
   are more resilient (able to return to pre-disturbance conditions) to
   single high-severity fires than their mainland counterparts, because
   they can recover more quickly through epicormic resprouting. However,
   clear-felling reduces this resilience for several decades because it
   decreases median tree size and, hence, leads to higher post-fire
   mortality. It is difficult to predict how the Tasmanian subspecies will
   respond to an increased frequency of high-severity fires associated with
   a projected warmer and drier climate.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The mixed severity fire regime of western Oregon forests creates a
   complex post-fire landscape mosaic with patches of low, moderate and
   high overstory tree mortality. Conversion of old-growth forests into
   plantations and post-fire salvage logging are widespread land uses that
   dramatically affect structure, biomass and carbon stocks. Few studies,
   however, have quantified the complex responses to wildfire and land
   management (i.e. logging and post-fire salvage logging) over long time
   periods. We quantified total aboveground biomass and composition in
   forest stands following low, moderate, and high severity fires 15 (2002
   Apple Fire) and 29 years (1991 Warner Creek Fire) following fire in low
   elevation, old-growth forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudorsuga
   menziesii). We also sampled post-fire responses in forest plantations
   (harvested prior to fire) and salvage-logged sites (harvested after
   fire) in the same fires. Fire severity had dramatic effects on the
   partitioning of total aboveground biomass (TAGS). Most of the TAGS in
   high severity fires was sequestered in dead trees (> 43\%) and downed
   wood (> 29\%) while live trees comprised the largest component of TAGS
   (> 62\%) in low severity fires. In spite of differences in overstory
   mortality, there was no significant difference in the TAGS between the
   low, moderate and high severity fires 15 years following fire (Apple
   Fire). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the low
   and high severity burns 29 years following fire (Warner Creek Fire).
   Managed forests (salvage and plantations) had significantly lower
   post-fire aboveground biomass and carbon storage that the natural
   forests. The TAGB of salvage logged sites was 49\% and 42\% that of the
   high severity sites at the Apple Fire and Warner Creek Fire,
   respectively. The mean TAGS of plantations was lowest of all fire and
   land use scenarios. At the Warner Creek Fire, TAGS of the plantations
   were < 30\% of that of the high severity fire sites (e.g. 326 and 984 Mg
   ha(-1), respectively). This equates to a difference in aboveground
   carbon in the managed compared to the natural stands of 553 Mg CO(2)e
   ha(-1) at the Apple Fire and 781 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) at the Warner Creek
   Fire. This research highlights the management tradeoffs involving values
   relating to carbon storage and wood harvest following fires.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a major forest disturbance in interior Alaska that can both
   directly and indirectly alter ecological processes. We used a

   ground cover assessments measured in the field, and high-resolution

   2004 Taylor Complex in Alaska's boreal forest. We applied a linear
   spectral unmixing model with five endmembers representing green moss,
   non-photosynthetic moss, charred moss, ash and soil to reflectance data
   to produce fractional cover maps. Our study sites spanned low to
   moderately high burn severity, and both black and white spruce forest
   types; high cover of green or non-photosynthetic moss in the remotely
   sensed imagery indicated low consumption, whereas high cover of charred
   moss, ash or soil indicated higher consumption. Strong relationships
   (R-2 = 0.5 to 0.6) between green moss estimated from the imagery and
   both post-fire depth and percentage consumption suggest that potential

Abstract = {{Post-fire salvage logging is a common silvicultural practice around the
   world, with the potential to alter the regenerative capacity of an
   ecosystem and thus its role as a source or a sink of carbon. However,
   there is no information on the effect of burnt wood management on the
   net ecosystem carbon balance. Here, we examine for the first time the
   effect of post-fire burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon
   balance by comparing the carbon exchange of two treatments in a burnt
   Mediterranean coniferous forest treated by salvage logging (SL, felling
   and removing the logs and masticating the woody debris) and
   Nonintervention (NI, all trees left standing) using eddy covariance
   measurements. Using different partitioning approaches, we analyze the
   evolution of photosynthesis and respiration processes together with
   measurements of vegetation cover and soil respiration and humidity to
   interpret the differences in the measured fluxes and underlying
   processes. Results show that SL enhanced CO2 emissions of this burnt
   pine forest by more than 120 g C m(-2) compared to the NI treatment for
   the period June-December 2009. Although soil respiration was around 30\%
   higher in NI during growing season, this was more than offset by
   photosynthesis, as corroborated by increases in vegetation cover and
   evapotranspiration. Since SL is counterproductive to climate-change and
   Kyoto protocol objectives of optimal C sequestration by terrestrial
   ecosystems, less aggressive burnt wood management policies should be
   considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires can influence the canopy structure of resprouter forests in
   multiple ways including crown scorching and consumption, tree damage and
   mortality, and changes in resources available for recovery. Few studies
   have quantified post-fire changes in the canopy structure of
   fire-tolerant eucalypt forests, which limits understanding of the extent
   and persistence of fire effects on ecosystem processes including
   interactions with environment. In this study, we assess the impacts of a
   landscape-scale wildfire on the canopy structure of fire-tolerant
   eucalypt forests in temperate Australia using metrics derived from
   airborne lidar data. Our assessment, made seven years after the
   wildfire, encompassed four fire severities (unburnt, low, moderate,
   high) and involved 1084 lidar plots (0.06 ha, including validation using
   51 field plots) across an area of similar to 30,000 ha in a single
   forest type. We used Random Forest models to examine the relative
   importance of fire severity, pre-fire canopy metrics, climate and
   topography to the prediction of seven post-fire metrics representing the
   horizontal and vertical structure of the full canopy, the dominant and
   sub-dominant strata. Canopy cover at seven years post-fire was
   significantly reduced in moderate- and particularly high-severity plots
   (mean decrease of 30\%). High-severity fire also decreased mean canopy
   height and led to changes in the canopy relief ratio and rumple index
   consistent with a dominant stratum that was more heterogeneous and
   fragmented. In addition to fire severity, the pre-fire values of each
   metric were important to their post-fire prediction, suggesting that
   canopy structural recovery after this fire could have been influenced by
   any lingering effects of previous fires. Topographic and climatic
   variables were of comparatively minor importance to the prediction of
   post-fire canopy metrics, although relationships with the forest drought
   stress index indicated that canopy recovery was slowest at the driest
   sites. Our study provides quantitative evidence of significant changes
   in the canopy structure of fire-tolerant eucalypt forests that persisted
   for at least seven years after high-severity wildfire. Recent trends in
   southern Australia of shortened wildfire intervals and a drier climate
   will likely narrow the windows for canopy recovery of fire-tolerant
   forests, realizing predictions of a gradual opening and fragmentation of
   forest canopies in temperate Australia and associated changes in
   multiple ecosystem processes.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{353-362}},
Abstract = {{Increasing density of mid-storey vegetation since European settlement
   has been observed in forests and woodlands in several parts of the world

   attributed to a longer interval between fires since European settlement,
   but may also be influenced by tree removal during the same period. We
   hypothesised that the number of mature trees in a stand reduces
   mid-storey vegetation cover and the associated fire fuel hazard through
   competition. To test this hypothesis, we examined associations between
   mid-storey cover and fire fuel hazard and the mean diameter of trees
   within stands of open forest and woodland in south-eastern Australia, a
   region prone to wildfires. We found that vegetation cover between 2 and
   4m and 4 and 6m above the ground and two measures of fire fuel hazard
   were negatively associated with the quadratic mean tree diameter. Our
   results suggested that the removal of mature trees since European
   settlement may have triggered tree and shrub regeneration, resulting in
   higher mid-storey cover and fire fuel hazard. Thus, managing stands for
   the persistence and replacement of mature trees may contribute to
   long-term fuel reduction in Australian forests and woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are the major disturbance in Mediterranean ecosystems
   affecting both vegetation and fungal communities. After fire, fungal
   communities follow succession patterns mainly driven by the dynamics of
   post-fire plant communities. The aim of this study is to analyze
   post-fire fungal succession in a Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by
   Cistus ladanifer in northwestern Spain. Sporocarps were collected and
   identified on a weekly basis during the autumn season from 2003 to 2006
   in 100 m(2) plots located in recently burned plots (early stage) and
   mature stands (late stage). 146 fungal taxa were found during the 4-year
   sampling (56 late stage only and 23 early stage only). There was a shift
   in the taxa composition of fungal community during C ladanifer
   succession. Several taxa such as Coprinus spp. and Pholiota car-bonaria
   were found in the early stage of the succession, whereas late stage taxa
   like Lepista spp. or Con-ocybe spp. fruited in the last years of
   succession. Cistus-specific taxa such as Entoloma cistophilum, Hebeloma
   cistophilum and Lactarius cistophilus were classified as multi-stage
   taxa as they were able to fruit in both early and late stages.
   Furthermore, several mycorrhizal taxa, usually associated with mature
   forest tree stands, were able to fruit much earlier in C. ladanifer
   scrublands. According to the results of this study, these ecosystems,
   traditionally considered ecologically and economically unproductive,
   seem to exhibit significant levels of fungal richness and can play an
   important role in diversity conservation as well as acting as a bridge
   for mycorrhizal inoculum in the recovery of forest stands after fire.

Abstract = {{In recent years, increased wildfire activity and climate change have

   regeneration 8-15 years after fire in six burn areas in the lower

   range of elevations, aspects, and fire severities and found that
   densities of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are generally low, although areas of abundant
   regeneration do occur. Conifer regeneration was most limited in xeric
   settings, including more southerly aspects and elevations closer to
   lower treeline. Additionally, fewer juvenile conifers occurred at
   greater distances from mature, live trees indicating that seed source as
   well as topoclimatic setting limits post-fire tree regeneration.
   Projecting the extent of future forest cover is uncertain due to the
   possibility of future pulses of tree establishment and unknown depletion
   rates of existing seedling populations. However, current patterns of
   post-fire seedling establishment suggest that vegetation composition and

Abstract = {{Both topography and the occurrence of wildfire can strongly affect soil
   properties in forest successions. Although numerous studies have
   examined the effects of fire and topography, few have explored their
   shifting relative importance with time since fire. We measured physical,
   chemical, and biological soil properties in two topographic positions
   (north-facing and south-facing) in a Chinese boreal forest along a
   gradient of fire history. In the control site, topography strongly
   influenced soil properties, with north-facing slopes having higher soil
   moisture (SM), depth of organic matter layer (OML), total carbon and
   inorganic N concentrations, and lower pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   and nitrogen (DON). In the 1-year-post-fire site, wildfire erased
   topographic effects on soil variables, and greater changes in soil
   properties occurred on the north-facing slopes. The wildfire
   significantly increased soil pH, DON, ammonium and nitrate, and
   decreased SM, OML, DOC and microbial biomass, while no significant
   differences in soil properties appeared between high- and low-severity
   plots. In the 11-year-post-fire site, most soil properties were similar
   to the control except for microbial biomass, OML and DOC; topography
   again became a significant factor in explaining variations in soil
   properties. Fire severity was highly correlated only with soil pH in the
   1-year-post-fire site, whereas topographic factors were always
   correlated with some soil properties in the three sites. In the
   1-year-post-fire site, wildfire explained almost five times more
   variance than topography for most soil properties, whereas in the
   11-year-post-fire site, the proportion of variance explained by
   topography increased and even surpassed that by wildfire. These results
   demonstrate that the resilience of Larix gmelinii forest soils might be
   controlled by wildfires in the short term but by topography in the long

Abstract = {{Burnt wood remaining after a wildfire is a biological legacy with
   important implications for habitat structure, ecosystem regeneration,
   and post-fire management. Knowledge of the time required for snags to
   fall is thus a key aspect for planning forest restoration. In this
   study, we analyze the fall rate of burnt trees in a Mediterranean pine
   reforestation. Three plots of 18-32 ha were established after a fire
   across an elevational gradient spanning from 1400 to 2100 m a.s.l., and
   snag fall rate was measured on a yearly basis using an experimental
   setup that considered two levels of a thinning treatment: unthinned
   (where no post-fire management was conducted and all the snags were left
   standing after the fire) and thinned (where 90\% of the trees were cut
   after the fire and left on the ground). All the snags remained standing
   during the first and second winter, and thereafter, they collapsed
   quickly until reaching 100\% after 5.5 years. Snags in low-density
   stands resulting from thinning fell faster than in unthinned stands, but
   the differences were minor. There was a negative effect of tree diameter
   on the rate of collapse, especially in the unthinned treatment, but the
   effect of diameter was minor too. There was no effect of the elevational
   gradient on fall rate despite patent differences in climatic conditions
   and pine species across plots. The results support the contention that
   post-fire fall rate in dense pine plantations in Mediterranean mountains
   can occur quickly after the second winter and may show little variation

Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The worst forest fire in South Korea occurred in April 2000 on the
   eastern coast. Forest recovery works were conducted until 2005, and the
   forest has been monitored since the fire. Remote sensing techniques have
   been used to detect the burned areas and to evaluate the recovery-time
   point of the post-fire processes during the past 18 years. We used three
   indices, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI), and Gross Primary Production (GPP), to temporally monitor
   a burned area in terms of its moisture condition, vegetation biomass,
   and photosynthetic activity, respectively. The change of those three
   indices by forest recovery processes was relatively analyzed using an
   unburned reference area. The selected unburned area had similar
   characteristics to the burned area prior to the forest fire. The
   temporal patterns of NBR and NDVI, not only showed the forest recovery
   process as a result of forest management, but also statistically
   distinguished the recovery periods at the regions of low, moderate, and
   high fire severity. The NBR2.1 for all areas, calculated using 2.1 m
   wavelengths, reached the unburned state in 2008. The NDVI for areas with
   low and moderate fire severity levels became significantly equal to the
   unburned state in 2009 (p > 0.05), but areas with high severity levels
   did not reach the unburned state until 2017. This indicated that the
   surface and vegetation moisture conditions recovered to the unburned
   state about 8 years after the fire event, while vegetation biomass and
   health required a longer time to recover, particularly for high severity
   regions. In the case of GPP, it rapidly recovered after about 3 years.
   Then, the steady increase in GPP surpassed the GPP of the reference area
   in 2015 because of the rapid growth and high photosynthetic activity of
   young forests. Therefore, the concluding scientific message is that,
   because the recovery-time point for each component of the forest
   ecosystem is different, using only one satellite-based indicator will
   not be suitable to understand the post-fire recovery process. NBR, NDVI,
   and GPP can be combined. Further studies will require more approaches
   using various terms of indices.}},

Abstract = {{The role of fire in governing rainforesteucalypt forest ecotone dynamics
   is of theoretical interest and has conservation management implications.
   Several eucalypt forests in the Wet Tropics of Australia have an
   endangered status due to extensive conversion to rainforest. Rainforest
   plants are known to survive occasional low intensity fires in the
   eucalypt forest ecotone. However, the ability of rainforest plants to
   survive frequent fires remains untested. The timing of rainforest
   expansion is also a subject of interest, and is generally considered to
   be delayed until fire has been absent for several years. We used 14
   years of data collected across 13 plots in the Wet Tropics of
   north-eastern Australia to test predictions regarding rainforest
   seedling recruitment and post-fire regenerative capacity. The 13 plots
   received different numbers of fires, between zero and five, over the
   14-year study. The recruitment of new rainforest plants in the ecotone
   was most abundant in the initial year after fire. If this post-fire
   pulse of recruitment is left undisturbed, it can facilitate the
   subsequent germination of additional rainforest species. The removal of
   grass cover, whether temporarily in the immediate post-fire environment
   or once a developing rainforest mid strata shades out grasses, appears
   crucial to abundant rainforest recruitment. A variety of tropical
   rainforest species can persist under a frequent fire regime through
   resprouting. The difference in the mode of resprouting, between
   ground-level coppicing rainforest plants and canopy resprouting eucalypt
   forest trees, is the critical mechanism that causes regular fire to
   maintain an open structure in eucalypt forests. The inability of
   rainforest species to maintain their height when fires fully scorch
   their crowns, temporarily resets the forest's open structure and delays
   the rainforest's ability to dominate through shading out grasses to
   transform the ecosystem into a closed forest.}},

   encroachment in the Klamath Mountains}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{270}},
Pages = {{25-34}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Fire exclusion in forests across the western United States has resulted
   in widespread vegetation change, often with notable increases in density
   and cover of fire-sensitive species. In California oak woodlands,
   encroachment by the more shade-tolerant native Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii) is particularly common, and results in the piercing and
   eventual overtopping of crowns of shade-intolerant trees. We
   investigated canopy competition, paired tree ages, and post-fire effects
   in a recently burned, encroached California black oak (Quercus
   kelloggii) woodland. Pre-fire woodland overstory was heavily dominated
   by Douglas-fir, which commonly pierced and overtopped California black
   oak crowns. Trees that pierced overstory oak crowns were younger (mean
   difference = 43.6 years, p < 0.001) than their paired oaks. Fire effects
   were variable, leaving some areas unchanged and others with complete
   above-ground stem mortality. Although above-ground stem-kill was often
   high for California black oak, the majority (82\%) re-sprouted from the
   root collar. Logistic modeling revealed a significant relationship
   between California black oak mortality and neighboring Douglas-fir
   height and plot heat load index. The probability of California black oak
   mortality increased as neighboring Douglas-fir height increased and
   decreased with increasing heat load index. Probability of mortality for
   Douglas-fir decreased with increasing tree size, while the probability
   of California black oak top-kill was much higher than that for 20-30 cm
   dbh Douglas-fir across a continuous measure of char height. Results
   indicate that competitive pressure from encroaching trees may compromise
   California black oak's ability to survive fire while resilience of
   encroaching Douglas-fir improves with greater size. Caution should be
   taken when planning and implementing restoration activities in
   California black oak woodlands to minimize loss of compromised, remnant
   oaks while still achieving adequate removal of encroaching conifers. (C)

Abstract = {{The study contributes remote sensing data to the discussion about
   effects of post-fire wood management strategies on forest regeneration.
   Land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Differenced Vegetation
   Index (NDVI), estimated from Landsat-8 images are used as indicators of
   Pinus halepensis ecosystem recovery after 2008 fire in areas of three
   post-fire treatments: (1) salvage logging with wood extraction from the
   site on skidders in suspended position (SL); (2) snag shredding in situ
   leaving wood debris in place (SS) performed two years after the event;
   and (3) non-intervention control areas (CL) where all snags were left
   standing. Six years after the fire NDVI values similar to 0.5 estimated
   from satellite images and field radiometry indicate considerable
   vegetation recovery due to efficient regeneration traits developed by
   the dominant plant species. However, two years after management
   activities in part of the burnt area, the effect of SL and SS on
   ecosystem recovery is observed in terms of both LST and NDVI.
   Statistically significant differences are detected between the
   intervened areas (SL and SS) and control areas of nonintervention (CL);
   no difference is registered between zones of different intervention
   types (SL and SS). CL areas are on average 1 degrees C cooler and 10\%
   greener than those corresponding to either SL or SS, because of the
   beneficial effects of burnt wood residuals, which favor forest recovery
   through (i) enhanced nutrient cycling in soils, (ii) avoidance of soil
   surface disturbance and mechanical damage of seedlings typical to the
   managed areas, and (iii) ameliorated microclimate. The results of the
   study show that in fire-resilient ecosystems, such as P. halepensis
   forests, NDVI is higher and LST is lower in areas with no management
   intervention, being an indication of more favorable conditions for
   vegetation regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The role of fire in restoration of sagebrush plant communities remains
   controversial mainly because of paucity of information from long-term
   studies. Here, we examine 15-year post-fire responses of big sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata ssp wyomingensis) and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
   sarothrae), the two most abundant native shrubs at the John Day Fossil
   Beds National Monument, a protected area in north-central Oregon, USA.
   Fire effects were studied along gradients of topography and community
   type through time post-burn. Community types were distinguished as
   brush, plots dominated by big sagebrush and woodland, plots with a
   significant presence of Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) trees.
   Fire reduced big sagebrush cover in brush plots up to 100\% and in
   woodland plots up to 86\%. Broom snakeweed cover declined by 92\% and
   73\% in brush plots and woodland plots, respectively. Big sagebrush did
   not show signs of recovery 15 years after burning regardless of
   topography and community type while broom snakeweed populations were
   clearly rebounding and prospering beyond pre-burn levels. Our results
   showed that an area initially dominated by big sagebrush (cover of big
   sagebrush 10-20\%, cover of broom snakeweed 2-4\%) dramatically shifted
   to an area dominated by broom snakeweed (cover of big sagebrush <1\%,
   cover of broom snakeweed 5\%) in brush-dominated plots. Our results
   indicated that brush-dominated plots at lower elevation and southern
   exposures are the least post-fire resilient. We also observed a
   declining population of big sagebrush on unburned areas, suggesting the
   lack of post-fire recovery on burned areas was perhaps a result of low
   seeding potential by extant populations. Although more years of
   observation are required, these data indicate that recovery time, the
   encroachment of opportunistic competing shrubs, and the initial
   condition of vegetation are essential considerations by land managers
   when prescribing fire in big sagebrush communities. Published by

Abstract = {{The capacity of prescribed fire to restore forest conditions is often

   forest structure, potentially changing treatment assessments. We
   examined annual changes in forest structure in five 1 ha old-growth
   plots immediately before prescribed fire and up to eight years after
   fire at Sequoia National Park, California. Fire-induced declines in stem
   density (67\% average decrease at eight years post-fire) were nonlinear,
   taking up to eight years to reach a presumed asymptote. Declines in live
   stem biomass were also nonlinear, but smaller in magnitude (32\% average
   decrease at eight years post-fire) as most large trees survived the
   fires. The preferential survival of large trees following fire resulted
   in significant shifts in stem diameter distributions. Mortality rates
   remained significantly above background rates up to six years after the
   fires. Prescribed fire did not have a large influence on the
   representation of dominant species. Fire-caused mortality appeared to be

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires in forest ecosystems produce landscape mosaics that include
   relatively unaffected areas, termed fire refugia. These patches of
   persistent forest cover can support fire-sensitive species and the
   biotic legacies important for post-fire forest recovery, yet little is
   known about their abundance and distribution within fire perimeters.
   Readily accessible 30-m resolution satellite imagery and derived burn
   severity products are commonly employed to characterize post-fire
   landscapes; however, coarse image resolution, generalized burn severity
   thresholds, and other limitations can constrain accurate representation
   of fire refugia. This study quantifies the abundance and pattern of fire
   refugia within 10 fires occurring in ponderosa pine and dry
   mixed-conifer forests between 2000 and 2003. We developed
   high-resolution maps of post-fire landscapes using semi-automated,
   object-based classification of 1-m aerial imagery, conducted imagery-
   and field-based accuracy assessments, and contrasted these with
   Landsat-derived burn severity metrics. Fire refugia area within burn
   perimeters ranged from 20\% to 57\%. Refugia proportion generally
   decreased with increasing Landsat-derived burn severity, but still
   accounted for 3-12\% of areas classified as high severity. Patch size
   ranged from 1-m(2) isolated trees to nearly 8000 ha, and median patch
   size was 0.01 ha-substantially smaller than a 30-m Landsat pixel. Patch
   size was negatively related to burn severity; distance to fire refugia
   from open areas was positively related to burn severity. Finally,
   optimized thresholds of 30-m post-fire normalized burn ratio (NBR) and
   relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) delineated fire
   refugia with an accuracy of 77\% when validated against the 1-m
   resolution maps. Estimations of fire refugia abundance based on
   Landsat-derived burn severity metrics are unlikely to detect small,
   isolated fire refugia patches. Finer-resolution maps can improve
   understanding of the distribution of forest legacies and inform
   post-fire management activities including reforestation and treatments.}},

Title = {{Effects of wildfire on soil nutrients in Mediterranean ecosystems}},
Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{47-58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{High-intensity and fast-spreading wildfires are natural in the
   Mediterranean basin. However, since 1960, wildfire occurrence has
   increased because of changes in land use, which resulted in extensive
   land abandonment, increases in the fuel load and continuity in the
   landscape. The level of soil degradation related to wildfire occurrence
   depends on fire recurrence, topography of the site, intensity of the
   soil erosion processes and plant cover post-fire regeneration rate.
   Therefore assessing fire impacts on soil properties is critical to
   quantify land degradation processes and to assess post-fire restoration
   plans. This article reviews the changes in soil nutrient status of
   Mediterranean ecosystems affected by wildfires by focusing on the
   interactions between the different drivers and factors, and the
   underlying processes of these changes. Articles dealing with wildfires
   in areas belonging to the Mediterranean basin and characterized by an
   annual average rainfall of 300-900 mm and a mean annual temperature
   around 14-19 degrees C, have been reviewed. The data show that the soil
   nutrient content in Mediterranean drylands affected by wildfires depends
   on the vegetation type, fire recurrence and fire intensity. Immediately
   after a fire, the nutrient content in both the O and A horizons often
   increases because of ash deposition, nutrient release from the burnt
   vegetation and formation of stable nutrient forms. Ash deposition
   persistence on the soil surface is one of the most important factors in
   determining the soil nutrient content both immediately after a fire and
   for the long-term. For the restoration of burned habitats it is
   important to know the content and the spatial distribution of nutrients
   in the soil because this can act as a limiting factor to vegetation
   recovery. Carbon and nitrogen pools in the soil have been recognized as
   fundamental to vegetation recuperation after a fire. To promote the
   accumulation and retention of nutrients in soil after a fire, it is
   important to stabilize the burnt site by applying post-fire measures
   that limit soil erosion, surface runoff and wind loss of the ash.
   Depending on the plant species and the time elapsing between consecutive
   wildfires, fire is responsible for the transition from mature ecosystems
   (i.e. conifer forests) to shrublands, which are poorer in soil nutrient
   status. Wildfire occurrence can be reduced by planting fire-resilient
   plants in fire-prone areas. To define the best post-fire and restoration
   treatments, the impacts of fire on both the O and the A horizon as well
   as the impacts of different post-fire treatments on the soil nutrient
   content require further study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Erosion of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) following severe wildfire

   rarely been quantified in burned landscapes. To better understand the
   magnitude and temporal pattern of these losses, we analysed the C and N
   content of sediment collected in severely burned hillslopes and
   catchments across the western USA over the first 4 post-fire years. We
   also compared soil C and N losses from areas receiving common
   erosion-mitigation treatments and untreated, burned areas. The
   concentrations of C and N in the eroded material (0.23-0.98 g C kg(-1)
   and 0.01-0.04 g N kg(-1)) were similar to those of mineral soils rather
   than organic soil horizons or combusted vegetation. Losses of eroded
   soil C and N were highly variable across sites, and were highest the
   first 2 years after fire. Cumulative erosional losses from untreated,
   burned areas ranged from 73 to 2253 kg C ha(-1) and from 3.3 to 110 kg N
   ha(-1) over 4 post-fire years. Post-fire erosion-mitigation treatments
   reduced C and N losses by up to 75\% compared with untreated areas.
   Losses in post-fire erosion are estimated to be <10\% of the total soil
   C and N combusted during severe wildfire and <10\% of post-fire soil C
   and N stocks remaining in the upper 20 cm of mineral soil. Although loss
   of soil C and N in post-fire erosion is unlikely to impair the

Abstract = {{Forested fire refugia (trees that survive fires) are important
   disturbance legacies that provide seed sources for post-fire
   regeneration. Conifer regeneration has been limited following some
   recent western fires, particularly in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
   forests. However, the extent, characteristics, and predictability of
   ponderosa pine fire refugia are largely unknown. Within 23 fires in
   ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the Colorado Front Range
   (1996-2013), we evaluated the spatial characteristics and predictability
   of refugia: first using Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) burn
   severity metrics, then using land-scape variables (topography, weather,
   anthropogenic factors, and pre-fire forest cover). Using 1-m resolution
   aerial imagery, we created a binary variable of post-fire conifer
   presence ('Conifer Refugia') and absence ('Conifer Absence') within 30-m
   grid cells. We found that maximum patch size of Conifer Absence was
   positively correlated with fire size, and 38\% of the burned area was >=
   50m from a conifer seed source, revealing a management challenge as fire
   sizes increase with warming further limiting conifer recovery. In
   predicting Conifer Refugia with two MTBS-produced databases, thematic
   burn severity classes (TBSC) and continuous Relative differenced
   Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) values, Conifer Absence was high in
   previously forested areas of Low and Moderate burn severity classes in
   TBSC. RdNBR more accurately identified post-fire conifer survivorship.
   In predicting Conifer Refugia with landscape variables, Conifer Refugia
   were less likely during burn days with high maximum temperatures: while
   Conifer Refugia were more likely on moister soils and closer to higher
   order streams, homes, and roads; and on less rugged, valley topography.
   Importantly, pre-fire forest canopy cover was not strongly associated
   with Conifer Refugia. This study further informs forest management by
   mapping post-fire patches lacking conifer seed sources, validating the
   use of RdNBR for fire refugia, and detecting abiotic and topographic
   variables that may promote conifer refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience against fire disturbance of Mediterranean vegetation has been
   frequently described. However, due to climatic change and abandonment of
   local land use practices, the fire regime is changing, probably leading
   to higher intensities and frequencies of disturbance events. The
   forthcoming scenario calls for a full understanding of post-disturbance
   tree recruitment processes, structural resilience and possible
   consequences on the overall forest biodiversity. In particular,
   knowledge on severe crown fires' effects on forest stand structural
   attributes needs to be further explored. In this work, we describe and
   quantify fire impact and short-term response of a Mediterranean forest
   affected by high severity crown fires, focusing on the compositional and
   structural diversity of living and dead trees, spatial pattern of
   fire-induced mortality, recovery dynamics of tree species. The analysis,
   based on a synchronic approach, was carried out within four burned and
   two not burned fully stem-mapped research plots located in NW Italy,
   belonging to two forest categories differing for their main tree
   restoration strategies. Distance-dependent and distance-independent
   indices were applied to assess structural diversity dynamics over time
   since fire occurrence. Within the analyzed forests fire was found to
   affect mostly forest structure rather than its composition. Number of
   snags largely increases immediately after the fire, but it levels off
   due to their fall dynamics. Regeneration strategies and fire severity
   influenced species abundance and consequently diversity patterns. Stem
   diameter and height diversity were modified as well, with a strong
   increase in the first post-fire year and a sharp reduction six years
   after the disturbance. Fire determined also a higher heterogeneity in
   crown cover and vertical structure. Spatial patterns of surviving trees
   and snags were greatly affected by fire, producing an increase in
   aggregation and segregation mechanisms. Autosuccessional processes are
   supposed to preserve current forest structure and composition, but the
   ecosystem self-restoring capability should be analyzed in the light of
   the possible changes in fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in fire characteristics, termed pyrodiversity, plays an
   important role in structuring post-fire communities, but little is known
   about the importance of pyrodiversity for individual species. The
   availability of diverse post-fire habitats may be key for
   fire-associated species if they require different resources at different
   life-history stages. We tested for age-specific habitat relationships in
   the black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire specialist. We used
   radio-telemetry to track fledgling and adult woodpeckers in burned
   forests and built resource selection functions to compare the effect of
   stand-, tree- and snag-level covariates between adults and fledglings.
   Fledgling black-backed woodpeckers selected habitat with more live trees
   than adults and used more heterogeneous habitats burned at lower
   severity, illustrating strong age-dependent effects on habitat
   selection. Within selected stands, fledglings were less likely to use
   snags and more likely to use live trees when compared to adults, but
   both age classes showed strong positive selection for larger-diameter
   trees (live and dead). Over the 60days after leaving their nests,
   fledglings showed an increasing propensity to use snags rather than live
   trees. Our results provide evidence that the predation-starvation
   hypothesis, which posits a trade-off between foraging efficiency and the
   need to minimise predation risk, plays a role in structuring the
   age-dependent habitat use of a burned forest specialist. Adult
   black-backed woodpeckers selected resources associated with food
   availability, but these resources occurred in relatively open, exposed
   habitat. Fledglings selected habitat that provided increased cover,
   perhaps as a strategy to reduce predation risk.Synthesis and
   applications. Globally, fires are increasing in severity and extent,
   leading to increased focus on fire-associated species that play keystone
   roles in facilitating biodiversity resilience. Our findings suggest that
   a diversity of patches burned at different severities may benefit
   post-fire specialists like the black-backed woodpecker at multiple
   life-history stages. The increasing prevalence of large, homogeneously
   high-severity megafires' may present an emerging threat even to

Abstract = {{There is a public perception that large high-severity wildfires decrease
   biodiversity and increase fire hazard by homogenizing vegetation
   composition and increasing the cover of mid-story vegetation. But a
   growing literature suggests that vegetation responses are nuanced. LiDAR
   technology provides a promising remote sensing tool to test hypotheses
   about post-fire vegetation regrowth because vegetation cover can be
   quantified within different height strata at fine scales over large
   areas. We assess the usefulness of airborne LiDAR data for measuring
   post-fire mid-story vegetation regrowth over a range of spatial
   resolutions (10 x 10 m, 30 x 30 m, 50 x 50 m, 100 x 100 m cell size) and
   investigate the effect of fire severity on regrowth amount and spatial
   pattern following a mixed severity wildfire in Warrumbungle National
   Park, Australia. We predicted that recovery would be more vigorous in
   areas of high fire severity, because park managers observed dense
   post-fire regrowth in these areas. Moderate to strong positive
   associations were observed between LiDAR and field surveys of mid-story
   vegetation cover between 0.5-3.0 m. Thus our LiDAR survey was an apt
   representation of on-ground vegetation cover. LiDAR-derived mid-story
   vegetation cover was 22-40\% lower in areas of low and moderate than
   high fire severity. Linear mixed-effects models showed that fire
   severity was among the strongest biophysical predictors of mid-story
   vegetation cover irrespective of spatial resolution. However much of the
   variance associated with these models was unexplained, presumably
   because soil seed banks varied at finer scales than our LiDAR maps.
   Dense patches of mid-story vegetation regrowth were small (median size
   0.01 ha) and evenly distributed between areas of low, moderate and high
   fire severity, demonstrating that high-severity fires do not homogenize
   vegetation cover. Our results are relevant for ecosystem conservation
   and fire management because they: indicate that native vegetation are
   responsive and resilient to high-severity fire, and show the usefulness
   of remote sensing tools such as LiDAR to monitor post-fire vegetation
   recovery over large areas in situ.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchical approach for plant functional classification was applied
   to describe long-term vegetation change in Pinus halepensis burned
   forests. Plant species were initially grouped according to their growth
   form and afterwards data on species modes of regeneration, persistence
   and dispersal, together with some other specific competitive advantages
   were explored, resulting in the identification of 29 different
   functional groups, 14 for woody and 15 for herbaceous species. Three
   types of Pinus halepensis forests were identified, according to the
   structure of the understorey. For each forest type, a post-fire
   chronosequence of communities was selected for sampling. Data sampling
   was performed for at least two consecutive years in each community, so
   as to reduce the shortcomings of the synchronic approach and to increase
   the age range of each chronosequence. Even though the vast majority of
   the functional groups proved to be persistent throughout the post-fire
   development of vegetation, their species richness and abundance did not
   remain stable. An increase of annual herb richness and abundance was
   recorded in the first years after the fire, with the leguminous species
   forming the dominant functional group. For perennial herbs, the most
   abundant group was of species with vivid lateral growth, while the group
   of species with subterranean resource organs included the highest number
   of species. Finally, as far as the woody species are concerned, the
   groups that played the most important role in defining vegetation
   structure were the mono-specific group of the pine, the group of
   resprouting sclerophyllous tall shrubs and the group of obligate seeder
   short shrubs (with Cistus spp., among others). A negative relationship
   between the abundance of woody obligate resprouters and the regeneration
   of woody obligate seeders was found. The advantage of the proposed
   functional group approach over classical floristic or structural
   approaches for the long-term study of communities is discussed, together

   nitrate, ammonium (in concentrations present in the ash) and GA(3) on
   the germination of P, halepensis seeds and on lipase activity at early
   germination were studied under controlled conditions. Sub-optimal
   concentrations of nitrate-and ammonium-stimulated germination and the
   activity of lipase in the seeds. It is proposed that nitrate increases
   seed sensitivity to GA(3) while ammonium directly affects lipase
   activity, The balance between the inhibition of germination by the high
   pH of ash and its stimulation by the nitrate and ammonium present in the
   ash determines the overall effect of the ash on post-fire germination of
   Aleppo pine. The pine seedlings appear in high density among the trees
   but because of the effects of the ash they appear in sparse stands under
   the projection of the burned pine canopies, These seedlings benefit from
   weak inter- and intra-specific competition as well as improved mineral
   nutrition and have good chances to grow into large trees that will form

Abstract = {{The rate of vegetation recovery from boreal wildfire influences

   forest recovery assessments using satellite optical-infrared normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) and tower CO2 eddy covariance
   techniques indicate rapid vegetation recovery within 5-10years, but
   these techniques are not directly sensitive to changes in vegetation
   biomass. Alternatively, the vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter
   from satellite passive microwave remote sensing can detect changes in
   canopy biomass structure and may provide a useful metric of post-fire
   vegetation response to inform regional recovery assessments. We analyzed
   a multi-year (2003-2010) satellite VOD record from the NASA AMSR-E
   (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) sensor to estimate
   forest recovery trajectories for 14 large boreal fires from 2004 in
   Alaska and Canada. The VOD record indicated initial post-fire canopy
   biomass recovery within 3-7years, lagging NDVI recovery by 1-5years. The
   VOD lag was attributed to slower non-photosynthetic (woody) and
   photosynthetic (foliar) canopy biomass recovery, relative to the faster
   canopy greenness response indicated from the NDVI. The duration of VOD
   recovery to pre-burn conditions was also directly proportional (P<0.01)
   to satellite (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) estimated
   tree cover loss used as a metric of fire severity. Our results indicate
   that vegetation biomass recovery from boreal fire disturbance is
   generally slower than reported from previous assessments based solely on

Abstract = {{Forests dominated by old growth ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.)
   at Crater Lake, Oregon, have been viewed as good candidates for
   restoration via prescribed burning. Previous burn experiments in this
   ecosystem observed that ponderosa pine typically survived burning
   treatments but suffered high post-fire mortality from bark beetle
   attacks. This paper describes the results of four years of post-fire
   monitoring of ponderosa pine mortality and resin flow in areas subjected
   to low intensity spring burning (SB), moderate intensity fall burning
   (FB), or no burning (unburned controls, UC). Crown vigor estimates,
   correlated with ring width indices, were also included as a factor in
   mortality and resin flow analyses. Burn treatment was significant in
   both ponderosa pine mortality and resin flow, as follows: FB > SB > UC.
   These results suggest that resin defenses overall did not protect trees
   from post-fire beetle attacks. Crown vigor was positively related to
   both survival and resin flow. The relationships between burning, tree
   vigor, and resin defenses in this study suggest a complex web of
   interactions. Although some physiological mechanisms are still
   unconfirmed, these findings suggest that beetles may have been attracted
   to ponderosa pine following burning, perhaps via the release of volatile
   resin compounds. Following attraction, resin defenses appear to have
   been important for protecting trees from beetle attacks, with greater
   defenses in trees with higher crown vigor and higher growth rates.
   Management recommendations, including a gradual and incremental approach
   to fire restoration in these stands, are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) has invaded extensive areas of arid
   and semi-arid Australia following its introduction as a pasture species
   and for erosion control. It has been suggested that buffel grass has
   initiated a positive fire-invasion feedback in central Australia,
   disrupting existing fire regimes, encouraging further buffel grass
   invasion, and disadvantaging the native woody flora in particular, but
   this hypothesis has not been tested quantitatively.
   This study investigated recently burnt woodland areas near Alice Springs
   for evidence of a fire-invasion feedback, including the impact of
   changing fire behaviour (intensity) on the native woodland overstorey
   flora. Despite the limitations inherent in a short study of ecological
   processes in a highly heterogeneous environment, substantial field
   evidence was found to support the existence of a buffel grass-initiated
   fire-invasion feedback.
   Buffel grass invasion was significantly correlated with increased fuel
   loads. Increased fuel loads were significantly correlated with increased
   burn severity, although the direct relationship between the proportion
   of buffel grass and increased burn severity was marginally
   non-significant. High field variance resulted in inadequate power to
   test whether or not the relative abundance of buffel grass had increased
   in the post-fire community. Burn severity was significantly correlated
   with the mortality of woodland overstorey species, and with the
   proportion of fire survivors that were reduced to basal resprouts.
   Seedling density of canopy species was low. It appears likely that
   future recruitment of canopy species will be hindered by the dense
   post-fire reestablishment of buffel grass cover at some sites. The
   overstorey flora is thus likely to be adversely affected by increased
   severity of fire associated with buffel grass invasion. As a result,
   there may be major change in the structure and composition of some
   woodlands.}},

   forest (LD; burned in a wildfire in 1986 and managed in 2005) and high
   density forest (HD; burned in a wildfire in 1986 and no managed). For
   soils from each plot, we measured soil water repellency, aggregate

   carbon (IC), pH, electrical conductivity, extractable calcium,
   magnesium, sodium, potassium (K), phosphorus, aluminum (Al), manganese

   Significant differences were found in TN, IC, SOM, pH, K, Al, Mn, Fe and
   C/N ratio (p < 0.05). All soil properties were found to have largely
   recovered their pre-fire values. Soils were affected by the post-fire
   management practices implemented 20 years after the fire, as reflected
   in their respective physicochemical properties, so that soil properties

Abstract = {{In fire-prone ecosystems, changes in rainfall after fire could
   differentially affect seeders and resprouters, thus leading to
   long-lasting impacts on the vegetation. Climate change in the
   Mediterranean region is projected to reduce precipitation, expand the
   summer drought and increase fire danger. Understanding the sensitivity
   to changes in rainfall during the post-fire regeneration stage is
   critical to anticipate the impacts of climate change on
   Mediterranean-type areas of the world.
   Here, we investigated how species differing in post-fire regeneration
   strategy (seeders vs resprouters) responded to rainfall changes in a
   Cistus-Erica shrubland of central Spain. Drought treatments were
   implemented using a system of automatic rainout shelters with an
   irrigation facility before (one season) and after (four years) burning a
   set of experimental plots. Treatments applied were: environmental
   control (natural rainfall), historical control (mimicking the long-term
   rainfall), moderate drought (-25\% rainfall), and severe drought (-45\%
   rainfall). Plant demography and vigour (main woody shrubs), as well as
   abundance (shrubs and herbs) were monitored during the first four years
   after fire.
   The first post-fire year was the key period for the recovery of seeders
   (Cistus ladanifer and Rosmarinus officinalis), and their recruitment,
   cover and size significantly decreased with drought. However, density
   four years after fire was larger than unburned and it was significantly
   correlated with emergence during the first year, indicating that
   population controls were more on emergence than on establishment. In
   contrast, resprouters (Erica arborea, Erica scoparia and Phillyrea
   angustifolia) were hardly affected by drought. Plant community dynamics
   in the burned control plots progressively converged with the unburned
   ones, while that in the drought-treated plots lagged behind them,
   maintaining a higher cover, richness and diversity of herbs. This
   post-fire herbalization due to drought might facilitate an untimely
   fire, before seeders would reach sexual maturity, which could have major
   implications for the maintenance of the community. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recurrence of recent large wildfires is threatening the permanence of
   Pinus nigra Arnold (Black pine) forests in central Catalonia (NE Spain),
   due to the almost nil post-fire regeneration of this non-serotinous
   pine. Potential practices to carry out extensive reforestation programs
   with P. nigra may differ widely in terms of their final success,
   economic cost and undesired ecological impact. In this framework, we
   have analysed different types of vegetation clearing (mechanical,
   controlled burning or grazing), soil preparation (ripping or planting
   holes) and reforestation methods (broadcast seeding, spot seeding and
   planting) to restore P. nigra forests. We have compared these practices
   in terms of seedling establishment, but also in the light of their
   economic costs and ecological impact, through a new multi-criteria
   analysis. Seedling establishment after sowing was very poor and not
   influenced by vegetation clearing. In plantations, seedling survival was
   higher in the ripper treatment than in planting holes for all vegetation
   clearing treatments except the control one. Nevertheless, the higher
   economic cost of the planting holes treatment and the negative impact of
   mechanical clearing and burning on the small mammals community made the
   stated differences in seedling survival irrelevant. Thus, the
   multi-criteria analysis revealed that the two most preferred options
   were planting in uncleared or lightly grazed areas with soil preparation
   through ripping. This study gives some valuable insights about the use
   of new decision-support tools in restoration programs and provides

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Elevated wildfire activity in many regions in recent decades has
   increased concerns about the short- and long-term effects on water
   quantity, quality, and aquatic ecosystem health. Often, loss of canopy
   interception and transpiration, along with changes in soil structural
   properties, leads to elevated total annual water yields, peak flows, and
   low flows. Post-fire land management treatments are often used to
   promote forest regeneration and mitigate effects to terrestrial and
   aquatic ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the
   longer-term effects of either wildfire or post-fire land management on
   catchment hydrology. Our objectives were to quantify and compare the
   short- and longer-term effects of both wildfire and post-fire forest
   management treatments on annual discharge, peak flows, low flows, and
   evapotranspiration (AET). We analyzed ten years of pre-fire data, along
   with post-fire data from 1 to 7 and 35 to 41 years after wildfire burned
   three experimental catchments in the Entiat Experimental Forest (EEF) in
   the Pacific Northwest, USA. After the fire, two of the catchments were
   salvage logged, aerially seeded, and fertilized, while the third
   catchment remained as a burned reference. We observed increases in
   annual discharge (150-202\%), peak flows (234-283\%), and low flows
   (42-81\%), along with decreases in AET (34-45\%), across all three study
   catchments in the first seven year period after the EEF wildfire.
   Comparatively, annual discharge, peak flows, lows flows, and AET had
   returned to pre-fire levels 35-41 years after the EEF fire in the two
   salvage logged and seeded catchments. Surprisingly, in the catchment
   that was burned but not actively managed, the annual discharge and
   runoff ratios remained elevated, while AET remained lower, during the
   period 35-41 years after the EEF fire. We posit that differences in
   long-term hydrologic recovery across catchments were driven by delayed
   vegetation recovery in the unmanaged catchment. Our study demonstrates
   that post-fire land management decisions have the potential to produce
   meaningful differences in the long-term recovery of catchment-scale
   ecohydrologic processes and streamflow.}},

Abstract = {{The fires that occur in the Amazon are as damaging as the deforestation

   Approximately 3500 trees with diameter measured at 1.30 m above ground

   performed. The results showed that although the fire has increased the
   mortality and recruitment rates after 15 years, the highest mortality
   occurred on trees with smaller diameters (DBH < 30 cm), so the fire did
   not affect the survival of large trees in the long term, explaining why

Abstract = {{Alternative vegetation types that switch from one to another under
   contrasting fire regimes are termed fire-mediated alternative stable
   states (FMASS). Typically, pyrophylic communities (i.e., vegetation
   assemblages favored by burning) dominate under high frequencies or
   intensities of fire. Conversely, fire-sensitive (pyrophobic) vegetation
   types persist under long fire-free conditions. As the persistence traits
   of plants of FMASS systems are generally poorly researched, threshold
   levels of pyric disturbance that trigger `state-switching' are often
   unknown. Dense thickets of the obligate-seeder shrub waputi (Aluta
   maisonneuvei ssp. maisonneuvei {[}Myrtaceae]) form fire-retarding woody
   islands within highly flammable spinifex (Triodia spp.) grasslands in
   arid Australia. To examine the tolerance of Aluta thickets to burning,
   we investigated: (1) the influence of post-fire rainfall and fire
   severity on recruitment (a field study); (2) soil seedbank densities (a
   field study); and (3) fire-related dormancy cues in seeds (a germination
   trial). We found a positive relationship between recruitment and
   post-fire rainfall volume, and much higher mean recruitment at sites
   with high- (5.9 seedlings/m2) than low-severity-burnt (2.2 seedlings/m2)
   and unburnt shrubs (0.03 seedlings/m2). Post-fire regeneration was
   mediated by dense soil-borne seedbanks, and the germination trial
   indicated that smoke promoted germination. Although Aluta shrubs are
   invariably fire-killed, high-severity fires are unlikely to lead to
   state shifts from shrubland to grassland because of the ability of
   mature stands to regenerate from dense, fire-cued seedbanks.
   Nevertheless, given that Aluta seedlings are exceptionally slow-growing,
   post-fire droughts combined with fire-return intervals less than the
   Aluta primary juvenile period of c. 5 years could drive conversion from
   Aluta- to Triodia-dominated vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are becoming increasingly severe and common in many parts of
   the world, yet their effects on certain taxa remain poorly studied. In
   November 2006, a major wildfire occurred in the Pilliga forests of
   north-west New South Wales, Australia. This fire was severe and
   extensive, burning more than 120000ha. Prior to the fire, we conducted a
   study in the affected area assessing bat activity in relation to flyway
   size and riparian zones, allowing us to opportunistically compare before
   - and - after effects of wildfire on bats in burnt and unburnt areas. We
   assessed how bat activity and bat composition changed from 1 year
   pre-fire to 1 year post-fire and 4years post-fire, accounting for the
   effects of flyway size. A BACI analysis showed that there was an effect
   of time (year) on bat activity, with activity markedly reduced in both
   burnt and unburnt sites in the year post- fire, before recovering
   4-years post-fire to levels that approached pre-burn activity. However,
   there was no treatment or interaction effect, indicating fire alone did
   not affect bat activity at our sites. Activity was 50\% lower at
   supplementary sites more remote (similar to 5km) from the fire edge.
   Multi-dimensional scaling and permanova described a strong effect of
   year but no evidence of fire or stream size-mediated effects on species
   composition. The drop in activity post-fire coincided with a period of
   drought that subsequently broke in the year prior to our survey 4years
   post-fire. Some species-specific responses to the fire were evident and
   depended on the proximity to unburnt forest. We suggest the potential
   for landscape re-assortment, whereby some species may move from the
   unburnt landscape into the burnt landscape, possibly in response to a
   resource pulse of insects. A landscape pattern of movement could obscure
   the detection of direct fire effects on mobile bats. We suggest fire
   extent, proximity to unburnt vegetation and severity are key
   considerations when interpreting the response of bats to wildfire.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{199-207}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fire severity is thought to be an important determinant of landscape
   patterns of post-fire regeneration, yet there have been few studies of
   the effects of variation in fire severity at landscape scales on
   floristic diversity and composition, and none within alpine vegetation.
   Understanding how fire severity affects alpine vegetation is important
   because fire is relatively infrequent in alpine environments. Globally,
   alpine ecosystems are at risk from climate change, which, in addition to
   warming, is likely to increase the severity and frequency of fire in
   south-eastern Australia. Here we examine the effects of variation in
   fire severity on plant diversity and vegetation composition, 5years
   after the widespread fires of 2003. We used floristic data from two
   wide-spread vegetation types on the Bogong High Plains: open heathland
   and closed heathland. Three alternative models were tested relating
   variation in plant community attributes (e.g. diversity, ground cover of
   dominant species, amount of bare ground) to variation in fire severity.
   The models were (i) linear', attributes vary linearly with fire
   severity; (ii) intermediate disturbance', attributes are highest at
   intermediate fire severity and lowest at both low- and high-severity;
   and (iii) null', attributes are unaffected by fire severity. In both
   heathlands, there were few differences in floristic diversity, cover of
   dominant species and community composition, across the strong fire
   severity gradient. The null model was most supported in the vast
   majority of cases, with only limited support for either the linear and
   intermediate disturbance models. Our data indicate that in both
   heathlands, vegetation attributes in burnt vegetation were converging
   towards that of the unburnt state. We conclude that fire severity had
   little impact on post-fire regeneration, and that both closed and open
   alpine heathlands are resilient to variation in fire severity during
   landscape scale fires.}},

Pages = {{1-9}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming is projected to increase the frequency and severity of
   wildfires in boreal forests, and increased wildfire activity may alter
   the large soil carbon (C) stocks in boreal forests. Changes in boreal
   soil C stocks that result from increased wildfire activity will be
   regulated in part by the response of microbial decomposition to fire,
   but post-fire changes in microbial decomposition are poorly understood.
   Here, we investigate the response of microbial decomposition to a boreal
   forest fire in interior Alaska and test the mechanisms that control
   post-fire changes in microbial decomposition. We used a reciprocal
   transplant between a recently burned boreal forest stand and a late
   successional boreal forest stand to test how post-fire changes in
   abiotic conditions, soil organic matter (SOM) composition, and soil
   microbial communities influence microbial decomposition. We found that
   SOM decomposing at the burned site lost 30.9\% less mass over two years
   than SOM decomposing at the unburned site, indicating that post-fire
   changes in abiotic conditions suppress microbial decomposition. Our
   results suggest that moisture availability is one abiotic factor that
   constrains microbial decomposition in recently burned forests. In
   addition, we observed that burned SOM decomposed more slowly than
   unburned SOM, but the exact nature of SOM changes in the recently burned
   stand are unclear. Finally, we found no evidence that post-fire changes
   in soil microbial community composition significantly affect
   decomposition. Taken together, our study has demonstrated that boreal
   forest fires can suppress microbial decomposition due to post-fire
   changes in abiotic factors and the composition of SOM. Models that
   predict the consequences of increased wildfires for C storage in boreal
   forests may increase their predictive power by incorporating the
   observed negative response of microbial decomposition to boreal
   wildfires. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   among three geographic areas that differ in elevation and substrate;
   plots spanned the spectrum of fire severities and were resampled
   periodically from 1991 to 2013. For question 2, we sampled 0.25--ha
   plots (n = 72), broadly distributed across areas that burned as
   stand-replacing fire, in 1999 and 2012. Richness and species composition
   diverged early on between infertile low-elevation areas (lower richness)
   and more fertile high-elevation areas (greater richness). Richness
   increased rapidly for the first 5 yr post-fire, then leveled off or
   increased only slowly thereafter. Only 6\% of 227 recorded species were
   nonnative. Some annuals and species with heat-stimulated soil seed banks
   were associated with severely burned sites. However, most post-fire
   species had been present before the fire; many survived as roots or
   rhizomes and regenerated rapidly by sprouting. Among the 72 plots,
   substrate, temperature, and precipitation (the abiotic template) were
   consistently important drivers of community composition in 1999 and
   2012. Post-fire lodgepole pine abundance was not significant in 1999 but
   was the most important driving variable by 2012, with a negative effect
   on presence of most understory species, especially annuals and
   shade-intolerant herbs. Burn severity was significant in 1999 but not in
   2012, and distance to unburned forest had no influence in either year.
   The 1988 fires did not fundamentally alter subalpine forest community
   assemblages in Yellowstone, and ecological memory conferred resilience
   to high-severity fire.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the impact of different post-fire management options in a
   chestnut coppice on surficial processes by comparing splash erosion,
   mean weight diameter (MWD) and stability of soil aggregates, and the
   development of soil cover on the following three plots with an
   undisturbed forest plot: fire without post-fire treatment; fire followed
   by clear-cutting; fire followed by clear-cutting I year later. Splash
   erosion was monitored on an event basis (n = 44) over two growing
   seasons with splashboards, MWD and stability of aggregates were
   determined by dry and wet sieving, respectively, of soil samples
   collected three times throughout the 14-month study period, and soil
   cover was estimated six times. In the first year, clear-cutting did not
   result in an increased rate of splash erosion compared with the
   untreated, burned coppice, nor did it result in a deterioration of
   aggregate stability, although both fire-affected plots showed a decrease
   in MWD compared to the control plot. In the second year, splash erosion
   decreased substantially on these two plots, whereas the freshly cleared
   plot maintained splash erosion rates characteristic for the first year
   without a concomitant deterioration of MWD or aggregate stability. The
   strongest decrease in splash erosion occurred on the plot subject to
   immediate clear-cutting, which also experienced the most rapid
   development of soil cover. We conclude that post-fire clear-cutting does
   not have any adverse effects, as judged by splash erosion and measures
   of soil aggregation, beyond the fire-related ones. Due to the
   persistence of the erosion in the first year, however, we recommend
   immediate intervention where justified by economic considerations. (C)

Abstract = {{The mapping of burned areas and the estimation of post-fire forest
   regeneration is very important in order to examine the vulnerability of
   Mediterranean forest to the increased occurrence and destructiveness of
   fires induced by climatic warming and the changes in the traditional
   land use patterns in Southern Europe. Satellite remote sensing has been
   widely applied in forest fire-related research and has provided
   satisfactory results for burned area mapping, as well as valuable
   information concerning the post-fire condition of affected areas.
   Moreover, advanced classification techniques, such as object-based
   methods have been successfully used for the accurate mapping of burned
   areas and the estimation of the vegetation recovery in fire-altered
   landscapes.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the use of remote sensing in
   mapping a burned area in Kassandra peninsula, Greece and to assess the
   short term fire effects on the landscape. The specific objectives were:
   a) to develop an object-based classification model for mapping the
   burned area by employing a LANDSAT image and to evaluate the
   classification accuracy, and b) to develop an object-based
   classification model to monitor vegetation regrowth one year after fire
   by employing a SPOT image.
   The use of object-based classification resulted in very accurate mapping
   of the burned area when compared to field and aerial photography data.
   Moreover, the results of the analysis showed that about 58\% of the
   burned area was covered by vegetation one year after the fire event.}},

Abstract = {{In September 1989 a large natural Pinus halepensis Mill. forest on Mt.
   Carmel, Israel was burned down. The aim of this research was to suggest
   post-fire management regimes and to assess their influence on the
   recovery of the forest. Three treatments were applied to the old burned
   trees: (1) burned trees were left untreated; (2) burned trees were cut
   down, the trunks were removed but smaller twigs were left in the plots;
   (3) burned trees were cut down, the trunks and the smaller twigs were
   cleared. Four treatments were applied to the new seedlings in the
   cleared plots: (1) no seedlings were thinned out; (2) Pinus seedlings
   were thinned out; (3) Cistus seedlings were thinned out; (4) both Pinus
   and Cistus seedlings were thinned out. Species composition, percentage
   of cover, the density height and biomass of Pinus and Cistus seedlings
   were monitored.
   The results of this survey, carried out 4 years after the fire and 3
   years after the treatments, revealed that cutting or removing the burned
   trees had less influence on species composition and cover than the
   natural process of recovery. The thinning of seedlings influenced their
   height, biomass and survival. Post-fire management recommendations,
   based on the results of this and other research done in the same area,
   are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Mulching is frequently used to reduce runoff and erosion following
   high-severity wildfires. In commercial forest stands, post-fire salvage
   logging is common practice, although it can lead to increased erosion
   losses in recently burned areas. Field research concerning the effects
   of post-fire salvage logging on sediment production is limited and the
   effects of clearcutting in areas previously treated by mulching are not
   known. In this study, 36 experimental plots were established in three
   experimental sites affected by crown fires that caused moderate-high
   soil burn severity in the summer of 2013. Immediately after the fire,
   bark strands mulch was applied in 18 of the plots. Salvage logging took
   place at the end of the first winter following fire. Post logging
   treatments were: mulching + salvage logging, no mulching + salvage
   logging and no mulching + no logging. The objectives of the study were
   to determine whether mulching mitigates soil erosion caused by fire and
   salvage logging and also to assess the possible effects of wildfire and
   salvage logging, with and without mulching, on vegetation recovery.
   During the six month period lapsed between the wildfire and salvage
   logging, precipitation was higher than the annual mean in the area, and
   the average soil loss in the untreated burned soils was 18.5 Mg ha(-1).
   In that period, mulching significantly reduced soil loss (84\%). In the
   18-month period following salvage logging and in the absence of mulch,
   there was no increase in erosion due to logging (8.7 Mg ha(-1)) compared
   with the unlogged treatment (7.0 Mg ha(-1)) whereas mulching reduced
   significantly soil losses even after logging (2.3 Mg ha(-1)). Neither
   mulching nor salvage logging had any detrimental effects on the
   regeneration of natural vegetation. Our results showed that the mulching
   just after a fire can substantially reduce the subsequent erosion due to
   post-fire salvage logging without any significant adverse effects on
   vegetative regrowth. In addition, leaving the standing burned trees
   seemed not to be a feasible management option to reduce post-fire
   erosion and enhance vegetation recovery in those kind of stands. (C)

   in the northern Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe Basin, California J. Torrey
   Bot. Soc. 132: 442-457. 2005.-Tree cover in the mixed conifer zone in
   the Sierra Nevada is often interrupted by large shrub fields, or stands
   of montane chaparral. Chaparral stands are thought to be associated with
   either poor site conditions, or locations that have experienced severe
   fire. Fires have been excluded from mixed conifer forests for nearly a
   century because of a management policy of suppressing fire. This study
   quantifies the intervals between fires, and the response of chaparral
   shrubs and trees to fire and fire exclusion in six montane chaparral
   stands. Quercus vaccinifolia and Arctostaphylos patula were the dominant
   shrubs on all sites and the last fires burned in the six sites between
   1861 and 1882. The mean point fire return interval before fire
   suppression was 28 yr (range 1640 yr), and fire frequency in chaparral
   was lower than in nearby forest. The age structure of shrubs and trees
   in the stands indicate that shrubs and trees regenerated immediately
   post-fire. Shrub and tree regeneration, however, were not confined to a
   brief post fire period, regeneration continued for at least another five
   decades. On our sites, exclusion of fire due to fire suppression has
   caused the average area of a chaparral stand to shrink by 62.4\%.
   Chaparral has been replaced by forest and this vegetation change has
   reduced the heterogeneity of the mixed conifer forest landscapes in the

Abstract = {{Disturbances like biological invasions and fire may affect in unexpected
   ways plant-animal interactions. In northwestern Patagonia, introduced
   ungulates (cattle, horses and deers) are widespread and very common
   occupying more than 50\% of forests and shrublands, widely affecting
   these habitats. In addition, fire play a major role in creating
   landscape patterns in this region. We evaluated whether fire modify the
   impacts of introduced ungulates on plant-animal interactions. In a
   mature forest (unburnt) and in an early post-fire area (burnt) we used
   structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyzed the impacts of introduced
   ungulates on insect herbivory, pollination and pre-dispersal seed
   predation on Berberis darwinii, one of the most common understory shrub
   of temperate forests. We found that the effects of cattle on pollination
   and fruit set depended on the habitat condition (i.e. unburnt or burnt).
   Introduced ungulates in unburnt forest decreased fruit set through a
   reduction on pollinator visits. Conversely, introduced ungulates in
   burnt forest increased pollinator visits and flower production without
   affecting fruit set. On the other hand, damage patterns (herbivory and
   fruit/seed predation) were unaffected by cattle in both forests types.
   Either, low browsing pressure or induction of plant defences may explain
   our results. This study illustrates how modifications on biotic and
   abiotic conditions produced by fire may affect in complex ways the
   effect of introduced ungulates on plant-animal interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Germination behavior of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) forests
   soil seed banks after fire treatments in controlled laboratory
   conditions was analyzed. Germination response of all tree and shrub
   seeds after wildfires in the Leiria National Forest, Portugal, was
   simulated by treating sample trays of soil seed banks with distinct
   combinations of: burning time (0 min, 5 min, and 15 min), seed depth (5
   cm and 8.5 cm), and presence or absence of ash cover. The design
   included control samples for null hypothesis testing. During a time span
   of 20 months after treatments, the maximum number of seedlings observed
   every 30 day period, their taxonomical identity, the number of destroyed
   seeds, and the number of non-germinated seeds were analyzed. Six
   functional species groups, defined by germination response (i.e,.
   germinated, destroyed, non-germinated), were identified using
   minimum-variance hierarchical clustering and correspondence analysis. In
   addition, the influence of the three environmental design factors and
   three functional species groups based on their general germination
   response were then analyzed by means of general regression models.
   Clustering and ordination results suggest two obvious main groups in
   terms of post-fire germination response: 1) seeders-fast-growing pioneer
   shrubs that respond positively to post-fire germination, and 2)
   resprouters-slow-growing understory tall-shrubs in which germination is
   largely depressed. Each of the two main functional species groups were
   further subdivided into six sub-groups, which are distinct in mean
   germinated, destroyed, and non-germinated seed values. Burning time and
   seed depth were highly significant in explaining post-fire germination
   response, while the presence of ash cover was less significant. Results
   suggest that pioneer seeder behavior is largely promoted by wildfires
   that are, in turn, detrimental to slow-growing, late-sucessional tall
   shrubs. Forest fire hazard risk management can thus be put into
   perspective-seeder fuel beds are promoted by wildfire and are themselves
   highly fire prone, and resprouters are not (due to discontinuous
   horizontal and vertical structure and less flammable leaf composition).}},

Abstract = {{The first wildfires in sudden oak death-impacted forests occurred in

   To determine whether and how the sudden oak death pathogen, Phytophthora
   ramorum, survived the wildfires, we completed intensive vegetation-based
   surveys in forest plots that were known to be infested before the
   wildfires. We then used 24 plot-based variables as predictors of P.
   ramorum recovery following the wildfires.
   The likelihood of recovering P. ramorum from burned plots was lower than
   in unburned plots both 1 and 2 yr following the fires. Post-fire
   recovery of P. ramorum in burned plots was positively correlated with
   the number of pre-fire symptomatic California bay laurel (Umbellularia
   californica), the key sporulating host for this pathogen, and negatively
   correlated with post-fire bay laurel mortality levels.
   Patchy burn patterns that left green, P. ramorum-infected bay laurel
   amidst the charred landscape may have allowed these trees to serve as

Abstract = {{Pinus halepensis forests are among the forest ecosystems in the
   Mediterranean Basin most affected by fire. Their distribution across
   lowland areas, in particular along the wildland-urban interface,
   increases the need to understand their ecology and responses to fire
   regime for their effective management. Apart from the extremely
   flammable tree layer, in several stands of these forests there is an
   increased fuel load attributed to the well-developed understorey of
   evergreen sclerophyllous shrubs. Taking into consideration that, in
   contrast with the long period required for full development of
   post-fire-regenerating pines, these shrubs resprout vigorously within
   the first post-fire weeks, it is important to explore the temporal trend
   of fuel accumulation to determine the risk of a second fire across a
   burned landscape. Two post-fire chronosequences of, in total, 12 P.
   halepensis stands were considered for sampling in Central Greece. The
   first chronosequence corresponds to pine stands characterized by the
   dominance of evergreen sclerophyllous shrubs in the understorey (Type 1)
   whereas the second chronosequence corresponds to pine stands where the
   cover of such shrubs was lower (Type 2). This study helps in
   understanding the fuel dynamics according to the type of P. halepensis
   forest stand and to anticipate future biomass growth. The proposed
   equations are simple tools, enabling land managers to estimate
   understorey total fuel load easily by visually recording the cover and
   height of the evergreen sclerophyllous shrub component, to justify
   understorey fuel reduction measures.}},

Abstract = {{Fire activity, in terms of intensity, frequency, and total area burned,
   is expected to increase with a changing climate. A challenge for
   landscape-level assessment of fire effects, often termed burn severity,
   is that current remote sensing assessments provide very little
   information regarding tree/vegetation physiological performance and
   recovery, limiting our understanding of fire effects on ecosystem
   services such as carbon storage/cycling. In this paper, we evaluated
   whether spectral indices common in vegetation stress and burn severity
   assessments could accurately quantify post-fire physiological
   performance (indicated by net photosynthesis and crown scorch) of two
   seedling species, Larix occidentalis and Pinus contorta. Seedlings were
   subjected to increasing fire radiative energy density (FRED) doses
   through a series of controlled laboratory surface fires. Mortality,
   physiology, and spectral reflectance were assessed for a month following
   the fires, and then again at one year post-fire. The differenced
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) spectral index
   outperformed other spectral indices used for vegetation stress and burn
   severity characterization in regard to leaf net photosynthesis
   quantification, indicating that landscape-level quantification of tree
   physiology may be possible. Additionally, the survival of the majority
   of seedlings in the low and moderate FRED doses indicates that
   fire-induced mortality is more complex than the currently accepted
   binary scenario, where trees survive with no impacts below a certain

Abstract = {{In areas where fire regimes and forest structure have been dramatically
   altered, there is increasing concern that contemporary fires have the
   potential to set forests on a positive feedback trajectory with
   successive reburns, one in which extensive stand-replacing fire could
   promote more stand-replacing fire. Our study utilized an extensive set
   of field plots established following four fires that occurred between
   2000 and 2010 in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA that were
   subsequently reburned in 2012. The information obtained from these field
   plots allowed for a unique set of analyses investigating the effect of
   vegetation, fuels, topography, fire weather, and forest management on
   reburn severity. We also examined the influence of initial fire severity
   and time since initial fire on influential predictors of reburn
   severity. Our results suggest that high-to moderate-severity fire in the
   initial fires led to an increase in standing snags and shrub vegetation,
   which in combination with severe fire weather promoted high-severity
   fire effects in the subsequent reburn. Although fire behavior is largely
   driven by weather, our study demonstrates that post-fire vegetation
   composition and structure are also important drivers of reburn severity.
   In the face of changing climatic regimes and increases in extreme fire
   weather, these results may provide managers with options to create more
   fire-resilient ecosystems. In areas where frequent high-severity fire is
   undesirable, management activities such as thinning, prescribed fire, or
   managed wildland fire can be used to moderate fire behavior not only
   prior to initial fires, but also before subsequent reburns.}},

Abstract = {{This study characterizes the seed bank prior to and immediately

   collected from five 5-ha burn units (6 plots per experimental unit)
   before and immediately after low-intensity prescribed fires, where
   maximum fire temperatures varied from <79 to 316 degrees C. A split-plot
   ANOVA and multi-response permutation procedures (MRBP) were utilized to
   assess the effects of burn treatment (pre- or post-fire) and seed bank
   layer (LD and MS) on the diversity and density of the buried seed bank.
   An average of 471 emergents/m(2) was observed in the buried seed bank
   comprising 133 identifiable taxa. No differences in total seed-bank
   density, Shannon-Weiner's diversity index (H'), or overall species
   composition between pre- and post-fire sampling or between the LD and MS
   layers were observed. Species richness (S) of the seed bank, however,
   was slightly greater pre-fire than post-fire, regardless of layer.
   Similarity, as defined by Sorenson's index, of species common to the
   seed bank and aboveground forest understory was low, with a slight
   increase in Sorenson's index observed during post-fire sampling of the
   seed bank and aboveground vegetation. Although we observed only
   negligible effects of a once-applied, low-intensity prescribed fire on
   the buried seed bank, the effects of a low-intensity prescribed fire
   management regime-one that involves repeated low intensity burns-on the

Abstract = {{The 2002 Hayman Fire was the largest fire in recent Colorado history
   (558 km(2)). The extent of high severity combustion and possible effects
   on Denver's water supply focussed public attention on the effects of
   wildfire on water quality. We monitored stream chemistry, temperature
   and sediment before the fire and at monthly intervals for 5 years after
   the fire. The proportional extent of a basin that was burned or that
   burned at high severity was closely related to post-fire streamwater
   nitrate and turbidity. Basins that burned at high severity on >45\% of
   their area had twice the streamwater nitrate and four times the
   turbidity as basins burned to a lower extent; these analytes remained
   elevated through 5 years post-fire. In those basins, the highest
   post-fire streamwater nitrate concentrations (23\% of USA drinking water
   standards) were measured during spring, the peak discharge period.
   Summer streamwater was 4.0 degrees C higher in burned streams on average
   compared with unburned streams; these persistent post-fire stream
   temperature increases are probably sufficient to alter aquatic habitat
   suitability. Owing to the slow pace of tree colonisation and forest
   regrowth, recovery of the watersheds burned by the Hayman Fire will

Abstract = {{We tested whether reduced parasite loads might contribute to high
   post-fire abundances of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We performed
   parasite examinations of 54 mice captured in burned forest in the area
   of Davis Fire (western Montana, USA), and 26 mice captured in nearby
   unburned forest. Mean abundance of ectoparasites (fleas, ticks, and
   lice) was lower in burned than in unburned forest. The difference was
   particularly pronounced for fleas, which were reduced by 70\% in burned
   forest. Endoparasites (i.e., nematodes and cestodes) were unaffected.
   Mechanisms for the lower mean abundance of fleas in burned areas are not
   known, but might involve flea mortality in burrows during fire or
   decreased transmission, survival, or both in the post-fire environment.
   We propose several hypothetical pathways through which reduced
   ectoparasite loads could cause an increase in deer mouse abundance, such
   as improved health status or increased foraging efficiency of mice, both
   of which could translate into the increased reproduction that has been
   reported in mice from burned forest. We encourage experimental tests of

Abstract = {{Understanding the proximate causes of post-fire conifer mortality due to
   smoldering duff fires is essential to the restoration and management of
   coniferous forests throughout North America. To better understand duff
   fire-caused mortality, we investigated tree stress and radial growth
   following experimental fires in a long-unburned forest on deep sands in
   northern Florida, USA. We burned basal fuels surrounding 80 mature Pinus
   palustris Mill. in a randomized experiment comparing the effects of
   basal burning treatments on stem vascular meristems; surficial roots;
   root and stem combinations; and a non-smoldering control. We examined
   the effects of duration of lethal temperatures (>60 degrees C) on
   subsequent pine radial growth and root non-structural carbohydrates
   (starch and sugar). Duff and mineral soil temperatures in the
   experimental fires consistently exceeded 60 degrees C for over an hour
   following ignition, with lethal temperatures of shorter duration
   recorded 20 cm below the mineral soil surface. Duff heating was best
   explained by day-of-burn Oe horizon moisture (P = 0.01), although little
   variation was explained (R-2 = 0.24). Post-fire changes in latewood
   radial increment in the year following fires was related to duration of
   temperatures >60 degrees C 10 cm deep in the mineral soil (P = 0.07),
   but explained little variability in post-fire growth (R-2 = 0.17). In
   contrast, changes in non-structural carbohydrate content in coarse roots
   (2-5 mm diameter) 120 days following burning were more strongly
   correlated with the duration of lethal heating 5 cm below the mineral
   soil surface (P = 0.02; R-2 = 0.53). Results from this study implicate
   the role of mineral soil heating in the post-fire decline of mature

Abstract = {{Fire is a common disturbance in many ecosystems, including arid
   Australia. Understanding whether fauna respond in a deterministic manner
   towards a single end-point, or to multiple states, is of crucial
   importance for conservation management. Why different taxa or
   assemblages display single or multiple end-points is also important to
   develop a synthetic theory of succession. To examine the post-fire
   changes in assemblages of spiders, we established a chronosequence study
   in spinifex habitat of central Western Australia. Ground-active spiders
   were pitfall-trapped over nine months in sites representing experimental
   fires (0 and 0.5 years post-fire) and wildfires (3, 5, 8 and 20 years
   post-fire). There were significant non-linear changes in species
   richness, evenness and composition of spiders with increasing post-fire
   age. For all three measures, the assemblage appeared highly
   deterministic, converging towards the long unburnt state. Similarity in
   richness, evenness and species composition to the 20-year-old sites all
   increased with increasing time since fire (38 years). However,
   experimentally burnt sites did not neatly fit this sequence. We consider
   two alternative hypotheses to explain this second trajectory: inertia
   within the system or the rapid migration and recolonization from nearby
   surrounding unburnt areas. Analyses indicated that half of the 179
   species had significant preferences for, or were restricted to,
   particular post-fire ages. This suggests that adequate pyrodiversity,
   both in terms of post-fire ages and/or scale and intensity of fires, may
   be important for the conservation of spiders in this habitat. However,
   owing to the high number of singletons and low indicator values, the
   significance of this result for conservation management remains
   equivocal. Despite this, the high degree of determinism provides hope
   that managers can develop a good predictive understanding of post-fire
   successional changes in spider assemblages in arid Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Fuel reduction treatments are increasingly used to mitigate future
   wildfire severity in dry forests, but few opportunities exist to assess
   their effectiveness. We evaluated the influence of fuel treatment, tree
   size and species on tree mortality following a large wildfire event in
   recent thin-only, thin and prescribed burn (thin-Rx) units. Of the trees
   that died within the first 3 years, most died in the first year
   regardless of treatment. First-year mortality was much higher in control
   and thin-only units (65 and 52\%) than in thin-Rx units (37\%).
   Cumulative third-year mortality followed a similar trend (78 and 64\% in
   control and thin-only units) v. 43\% in thin-Rx units. Percentage crown
   scorch is a strong predictor of mortality and is highly dependent on
   fuel treatment. Across all treatments, Pinus ponderosa had a lower
   probability of post-fire mortality than did Pseudotsuga menziesii.
   Finally, the probability of beetle attack on surviving trees was highest
   in large-diameter trees within thin-only treatments and lowest within
   thin-Rx treatments. This study contributes further evidence supporting
   the effectiveness of thinning and prescribed burning on mitigating
   post-fire tree mortality. We also present evidence that a combination of

Abstract = {{Natural fire regimes have been modified; therefore robust post-fire
   monitoring tools are needed to understand the post-fire recovery
   process. Satellites with high temporal resolution allow us to build time
   series of vegetation indices for monitoring post-fire vegetation
   recovery. One of the techniques used is to compare the time series of a
   burned plot with that of an unburned control plot. However, for its
   implementation it is necessary to select control plots in which the
   vegetation has the same structure and functioning than the plot burned
   before the fire. Previous study defined biological criteria to detect
   burned and unburned control plots with identical pre-fire vegetation
   functioning. Moreover, a non-parametric test routine of low statistical
   power was proposed to test them, this was based on the analysis of the
   QVI (Quotient Vegetation Index), calculated between NDVI (Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index) time series of the burned and control site.
   However, currently there are autoregressive analysis techniques with
   greater statistical power. Therefore the aims were to propose six new
   statistical routines based on autoregressive test, and compare the
   performance of these with the non-parametric routine. We selected 13,700
   forest plots and extracted the NDVI MODIS time series between 2002 and
   2005. We randomly selected 43 reference plots, and through each routine,
   we compared each reference time series with the other 13,657 time
   series. We estimated the performance of the routines measuring the
   euclidian distance between the time series of the reference plot and the
   time series of the plots accepted for each routine. We also measured the
   quality and the amount of the QVI time series selected by each routine.
   Autoregressive routines showed better performance than the
   non-parametric routine, since they selected control plots with NDVI time
   series with greatest similarity with respect to the reference plots and
   QVI series with highest quality.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire succession is an ideal case for studying effects of
   disturbance on community assembly, and the key is to disentangle the
   contributions of assembly processes to the variation of community
   composition, namely beta diversity, and the contingent scales. The
   central Yunnan Plateau of Southwest China is characterized by monsoon
   related seasonal drought, and frequent forest fires. We sampled five
   fire sites burned in different years and a middle aged forest, measured
   species composition dissimilarity and its species turnover and
   nestedness components, within each fire site and across all sites.
   Results indicated species turnover as the primary component of beta
   diversity within all communities. There was no trend of change with
   year-since-fire (YSF) in beta diversity among early post-fire
   communities, but beta diversity in the middle aged community was
   significantly higher. Species turnover patterns across fire sites
   revealed a weak dispersal limit effect, which was stronger at lower than
   upper slope position for woody plants, and reverse for herbs. At the
   site scale, the species dissimilarity and turnover both enlarged with
   increasing slope position difference, especially in the middle-aged
   community, but the species nestedness had no consistent trend among
   sites, except a decreasing trend in the middle-aged forest. (Partial)
   Mantel tests indicated habitat filtering {[} primarily indicating total
   nitrogen (TN) and slope position] played a much stronger role than
   dispersal limit and YSF (indicating competition intensity) for the
   post-fire forest assembly at the landscape scale, for both woody and
   herbaceous layers. However, at the site scale, Mantel tests indicated a
   diminishing effect of soil nutrient filtering with increasing YSF, while
   effects of topography and spatial distance in the middle aged community
   was stronger. This divergence suggests the primary assembly mechanism
   gradually shift away from the soil constraint. While the seasonal
   drought and the mountain topography dominate the environmental legacy,
   our results imply that fires may reinforce a priority effect in the
   forests assembly in this region, by creating a habitat filtering (e.g.,
   moisture and nitrogen limitation) effect on species composition in
   post-fire communities.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii is a pine species that regenerates quite
   well under its own canopy but has difficulty regenerating after fire.
   This study analyzes, by means of greenhouse and field experiments, the
   pattern of seed germination and seedling establishment of P. nigra in a
   gradient of post-fire environmental conditions. The results obtained in
   the controlled conditions experiment of cover effects in the absence of
   vegetation interference indicate that seed germination and seedling
   survival and growth of P. nigra attained their maximum values under high
   cover levels. In the field, seed germination and seedling survival of P.
   nigra were considerably lower than in the experiment outdoors but also
   followed to a large extent the cover gradient. However, there were
   differences among microhabitats depending on the type of vegetation
   present. In general, the behaviour of P. nigra is more similar to that
   of shade-tolerant species, such as oaks, than to low-altitude
   Mediterranean pines, because the establishment of P. nigra seedlings is
   improved under high cover conditions. As these conditions are usually
   lacking in recently burned areas, the regeneration of this species is
   strongly limited after fire. The difficulty in recovering after fire of
   P. nigra forests confirms that they require specific conservation

Title = {{Resilience of Mediterranean terrestrial ecosystems and fire severity in

Abstract = {{In recent decades, the fire regime of the Mediterranean Basin has been
   disturbed by various factors: climate change; forest management
   policies; land cover; changed landscape. Size and severity have notably
   increased, which in turn have increased large fires events with >500 ha
   burned (high severity). In spite of Mediterranean ecosystems' high
   resilience to fire, these changes have implied more vulnerability and
   reduced natural recovery with irreparable long-term negative effects.
   Knowledge of the response of ecosystems to increasing severity, mainly
   in semiarid areas, is still lacking, which is needed to rehabilitate and
   restore burned areas.
   Our approach assessed the resilience concept by focusing on the recovery
   of ecosystem functions and services, measured as changes in the
   composition and diversity of plant community vegetation and structure.
   This will be validated in the long term as a model of ecosystem
   response. Also, depending on the pre-fire characteristics of vegetation,
   fire severity and the post-fire management, this approach will lead to
   tools that can be applied to implement post-fire restoration efforts in
   order to help decision making in planning activities.
   Regarding Mediterranean ecosystems' ability to recover after wildfires,
   this study concludes that pre-fire communities are resilient in these
   fire-prone areas, but the window for natural recovery in semiarid areas
   Of Aleppo pine forest in SE Iberian Peninsula varied from 3 to 15
   post-fire years. Fire severity was also key for effects on the
   ecosystem: the vegetation types of areas burned with low and medium
   severity recovered naturally, while those areas with a high-severity
   burn induced shrublands. We concluded that very strong regeneration
   activity exists in the short term, and that the negative effects of
   medium- and high-severity fire are evidenced in the mid and long term,
   which affect natural recovery. Adaptive forest management to
   rehabilitate and restore burned Mediterranean ecosystems should be
   implemented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{396}},

Abstract = {{In 2011, the most destructive wildfire in Texas history (Bastrop County
   Complex Fire, BCCF) burned 34,000 acres including most of Bastrop State
   Park. We used dendrochronological analysis of vegetation paired with
   documentary information to reconstruct the historical fire regime,
   changes in forest composition, and possible human influences leading up
   to this seemingly unique event. In addition, demographics of fire-killed
   and immediate post-fire regenerating trees were determined through stem
   aging and a regeneration census. Historical fire frequency was lower
   during the pre-EuroAmerican Settlement period (pre-1830) compared to
   later time periods before the 1920s. Since the 1920s, fire occurrence
   has significantly decreased. Historical fire characteristics appeared to
   change with local and regional cultural and land use changes. Within the
   BCCF area were extensive areas of very old (up to 359 yrs old)
   open-grown post oaks (Quercus stellata) that had been overtopped by 60
   year old loblolly pines (Pinus taeda). Historically, oak woodlands
   likely persisted in the study area due to recurring fire and, though
   less well documented, by grazing and selective logging for loblolly
   pines. This region is an ecotone between the oak woodlands and Lost
   Pines and our data show transitions between the two types through time.
   It is unclear how this vegetation interaction may have affected the
   destructive BCCF, but its severity and effects were unprecedented during
   at least the last three centuries. Little to no loblolly pine natural
   regeneration existed despite being dominant in the pre-fire forest
   overstory. Based on stump sprout abundance, blackjack oak (Q
   marilandica) will likely be the dominant tree species in the next few
   decades. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean soils under heathland are often shallow, with low capacity
   for water storage, and a high risk of erosion. In this context,
   recurrent wildfires can negatively affect their chemical and physical
   properties. Very little research has been carried out concerning the
   long-term variations on the ground surface after burning. The behaviour
   of plant communities and plant cover can regulate and control soil
   processes in the post-fire period, so that the evolution of vegetation
   communities must be taken into account when studying the evolution of
   soil processes after disturbance. In this study, the impact of fire on
   several physical and chemical soil properties has been investigated
   during 3 years after experimental burning in a Mediterranean heathland.
   On average, the soil organic matter content after the fire decreased
   strongly, and one year after the fire it did not vary substantially,
   although it increased slightly during the following two years until the
   end of experiments. Burning led to coarser texture immediately after
   fire, but clay content decreased strongly during the following 3 years
   due to post-fire erosion processes and selective detachment of fine
   particles. Soil pH and electrical conductivity increased ephemerally and
   returned to initial values just 1-year after the fire. Soil water
   repellency was partly destroyed by the scorching, but pre-fire
   proportion of water-repellent soil samples was observed just after 1
   year. Water-repellent aggregates may have been removed by post-fire
   erosion, but water repellency also appears as a natural attribute of
   these soils. Reduction in organic matter content after the fire and
   changes in texture and water repellency contributed to a decreased
   stability of aggregates and an increased bulk density. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Wildfire severity and subsequent ecological effects may be influenced by
   prior land management, via modification of forest structure and
   lingering changes in fuels. In 2002, the Hayman wildfire burned as a low
   to moderate-severity surface fire through a 21-year pine regeneration
   experiment with two overstory harvest cuttings (shelterwood, seed-tree)
   and two site preparations (scarified, unscarified) that had been applied
   in a mature ponderosa pine forest in the montane zone of the Colorado
   Front Range in 1981. We used this event to examine how pre-fire fine
   fuels, surface-level bum severity and post-fire soil
   nitrogen-availability varied with pre-fire silvicultural treatments.
   Prior to the wildfire, litter cover was higher under both shelterwood
   and unscarified treatments than seed-tree and scarified treatments.
   Immediately after the fire in 2002, we assessed 2 bum severity under 346
   mature trees, around 502 planted saplings, and in 448 4 m(2) microplots
   nested within the original experimental treatments. In one-fourth of the
   microplots, we measured resin-bound soil nitrate and ammonium
   accumulated over the second and third post-fire growing season.
   Microplots burned less severely than bases of trees and saplings with
   only 6.8\% of microplot area burned down to mineral soil as compared to
   >28\% of tree and sapling bases. Sapling burn severity was highest in
   unscarified treatments but did not differ by overstory harvest.
   Microplot burn severity was higher under the densest overstory
   (shelterwood) and in unscarified treatments and was positively related
   to pre-fire litter/duff cover and negatively associated with pre-fire
   total plant cover, grass cover and distance to tree. In both years,
   resin-bound nitrate and ammonium (NH4(+)-N) increased weakly with bum
   severity and NH4(+)-N availability was higher in unscarified than
   scarified plots. The lasting effects of soil scarification and overstory
   harvest regime on modern patterns of surface burn severity after two
   decades underscores the importance of historic landuse and silviculture
   on fire behavior and ecological response. Unraveling causes of these
   patterns in burn severity may lead to more sustainable fire and forest
   management in ponderosa pine ecosystems. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{77-83}},
Abstract = {{The preference of grazing herbivores to feed on grass regrowth following
   savanna fires rather than on unburnt grass swards is widely recognised.
   However, there is little information on which factors govern patterns of
   resource selection within burnt areas. In this study, we attempted to
   disentangle the effects of different habitat and grass sward
   characteristics on the utilisation of post-fire regrowth by nine species
   of ungulates in a fire-dominated woodland savanna in north Cameroon. We
   used resource-selection functions based on logistic regression. Overall,
   the resource-selection functions identified the time elapsed since
   burning as the most influential parameter in determining probability of
   use by ungulates, as most species strongly selected swards that were
   recently burned. This pattern might be related to nutrient levels in the
   grass sward. In addition, most species selected areas with high grass
   cover and avoided grass swards with high amounts of dead stem material.
   This is likely to increase bite mass and, hence, intake rates. The
   avoidance of high tree cover by some species may suggest selection for
   open areas with good visibility and, hence, reduced risk of predation.
   Body mass seemed to have no effect on differential selection of
   post-fire regrowth, irrespective of feeding style.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important factor driving the position and stability of
   ecotones between fire-prone and less flammable forest types. To better
   understand, the recruitment processes that mediate plant persistence in
   ecotonal systems, we used manipulative field experiments in Australian
   wet eucalypt forests to investigate factors that may be regulating
   seedling recruitment and survival in burnt and unburnt forest. We found
   no evidence that safe sites from predators or exposure regulated
   seedling recruitment in three of the four study species, but one species
   associated with less flammable rainforest systems had increased
   germination rates in response to soil scarification. Seedlings of all
   four study species experienced higher rates of mortality resulting from
   herbivory or water stress in the post-fire environment. We found that
   intact ground cover increased seedling survival by reducing exposure to
   dessicating conditions and providing refuge from vertebrate herbivores.
   Our results suggest that shrubs associated with mesic, low-flammability
   forests have fewer opportunities for recruitment with desiccation risks
   in post-fire environments limiting seedling survival. In contrast,
   shrubs associated with high-flammability forests were capable of
   recruiting and surviving in both burnt and unburnt forests. Post-fire
   recruitment is likely to be more abundant after fire than at other
   times, but we found that survival can be highly constrained by post-fire
   herbivory. The ability of these species to recruit in undisturbed
   conditions provides some insurance against recruitment failure under
   stochastic variation in herbivory and desiccating conditions. The
   capacity to spread risks could be important in maintaining boundary
   position and diversity in these ecotonal systems.}},

Abstract = {{In ponderosa pine forests of western North America, wildfires are
   becoming more frequent and affecting larger areas, while prescribed fire
   is increasingly used to reduce fuels and mitigate potential wildfire
   severity. Both fire types leave trees that initially survive their burn
   injuries, but will eventually die. Predicting delayed tree mortality has
   received considerable research attention to aid in post-fire planning
   and management. The amount of crown scorched is recognized as the most
   useful variable for discriminating between trees that live or die, but
   models gain discrimination with additional variables such as bole
   scorch, bud or cambium necrosis, and post-fire bark beetle attack
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae). Here, logistic regression was
   used to determine what fire-injury variables are most associated with
   red turpentine beetle (RTB; Dendroctonus valens LeConte), or western
   pine beetle (WPB; D. brevicomis LeConte) attack within three years
   post-fire. This was tested on 7343 ponderosa pine representing a wide
   diameter range from 18 wild and prescribed fires in Oregon and
   Washington, and repeated on a subset of 884 large trees > 53.3 cm
   diameter. Bole scorch height was most associated with RTB or WPB attack
   on trees across all diameters, but model predictive ability was poor,
   whereas for pines > 53.3 cm, the models provided moderate discrimination
   for predicting attack by each beetle. In addition, mortality models
   using crown scorch proportion and bole scorch proportion were compared
   to models with an additional variable for RTB, or WPB attack in year
   one, or attack by either beetle in year one, or year three. Models
   including any one of these beetle variables outperformed the models
   using just bole scorch and crown scorch proportions. For both tree
   diameter groups, the models including RTB year one performed similar to,
   or better than models with any other beetle variable, and are preferred
   for predicting delayed mortality because the RTB attack functions as an
   additional tree injury indicator similar to cambium kill, not captured
   by the bole scorch proportion, or crown scorch proportion variables.
   Furthermore, RTB attack can be assessed within the first year post-fire,
   and is much faster and easier to evaluate than direct sampling of
   cambium necrosis.}},

   a rapid reestablishment of both the vegetation (cover, life form,

   recovered more quickly than the abundance of ants or springtails in some

Abstract = {{Myxomycetes are heterotrophic eukaryote organisms that have three life
   stages, none of which are known to be resistant to fire. The response of
   myxobiota to different severity of fire is not well known either. We
   examined myxomycetes in Pinus mugo plantations following a crown fire
   and in Pinus sylvestris plantations following a surface fire during the
   first three years after the wildfire event in forested coastal sand
   dunes in western Lithuania. Additionally, we investigated myxomycetes in
   corresponding unburned stands. All studied sites (unburned and burned)
   bore rather different myxomycete assemblages but the disparities of the
   species compositions between both burn types were more pronounced
   showing that fire severity had stronger impact on myxomycete species
   composition than the pre-fire stand type. Analysis of myxomycete
   assemblages (including the results from field collections, bark and
   litter cultures) showed that surface fire sites bore the highest number
   of post-fire species compared to crown fire and unburned sites. Dynamic
   annual changes in species composition were observed in all studied sites
   but only crown fire plots showed a clear chronosequence of post-fire
   myxomycete assemblages. Fire impact promoted establishment and/or
   sporulation of myxomycete species that are rare in similar unburned
   stands, or are usually confined to other types of forests and substrata.
   In addition, individual myxomycete species tended to switch substratum
   usage during the course of vegetation succession, with a final return to
   their usual substrata. This possibly signaled the end of early stage of
   post-fire succession. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical fuel treatments are a primary pre-fire strategy for
   potentially mitigating the threat of wildland fire, yet there is limited
   information on how they impact shrubland ecosystems. Our goal was to
   assess the impact of mechanical mastication fuel treatments on chaparral
   vegetation and to determine the extent to which they emulate early
   post-fire succession. Mastication treatments significantly reduced the
   height and cover of woody vegetation and increased herbaceous cover and
   diversity. Non-native cover, density, and diversity were also
   significantly higher in masticated treatments. Comparisons with
   post-fire data from two studies showed that certain ephemeral post-fire
   endemics were absent or of limited occurrence from masticated plots in
   comparison to their abundance on adjacent burned plots. Structurally,
   masticated sites differed in the dense woody debris cover, whereas
   burned sites had little such ground cover. Regional comparison of
   masticated plots to previously published post-fire studies found that
   burned sites had greater cover, density, and diversity of native
   species. However, masticated sites and burned sites were broadly similar
   in distribution of different growth forms. Results from our study show
   that the use of mastication fuel treatments in chaparral are not in
   alignment with some resource conservation goals, but in some cases it is
   recognized that such sacrifice of natural resources may be an acceptable
   tradeoff to potentially mitigating fire hazard.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing trends in wildfire activity on semi-arid rangelands
   necessitate advancement in understanding of fire impacts on vegetation,
   soils, and runoff and erosion processes. This study used artificially
   applied rainfall and concentrated overland flow experiments to evaluate
   the ecohydrologic response and recovery of a semi-arid shrubland in the
   Great Basin Region, USA, following fire. Rainfall experiments were
   conducted at the 0.5 m(2) plot scale to assess fire impacts on
   rainsplash and sheetfiow processes. Concentrated flow experiments were
   applied on 9 m(2) plots to evaluate fire impacts on concentrated
   overland flow processes. Vegetation, soil, hydrologic, and erosion
   variables were assessed at each scale pre-fite and 1, 2, and 5 yr
   post-fire. Infiltration and runoff on rainfall simulation plots were
   affected more by measured background soil water repellency than fire
   effects on vegetation and soils. Runoff from rainfall on shrub-dominated
   plots was unchanged 1 yr post-fire, but runoff from interspace plots
   between shrubs declined 1 yr post-fire. Runoff increased on shrub and
   interspace rainfall plots 2 yr post-fire and then declined in the 5 yr
   post-fire. Bare ground generally declined across study years,
   implicating the temporal variability in soil water repellency as the
   causal factor for infiltration and runoff trends. Erosion on rainfall
   plots increased by factors of 8 to more than 10 following fire removal
   of vegetation and ground cover and declined with vegetation recovery
   through five growing seasons. Concentrated overland flow plots generated
   slightly more total runoff and 26-fold-more total sediment 1 yr
   following burning relative to pre-fire measures. Erosion from
   concentrated overland flow remained greater on burned than unburned
   plots after five growing seasons even though ground cover returned to
   approximately 85\%. The relative recovery of vegetation and total ground
   cover were typical for the shrubland community assessed, but elevated
   erosion with 85\% ground cover 5 yr post-fire was unexpected. The
   persistent high sediment delivery from concentrated plots is attributed
   to the fine textured soils and thin litter accumulation. The importance
   of considering erodibility in context with sediment supply and
   vegetative recovery is discussed. The results demonstrate the complexity
   of post fire ecohydrologic interactions, advance process understanding
   of post-fire ecohydrologic responses for semiarid rangelands, and
   underscore the need for additional studies on post-fire recovery over
   time. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Vegetation responses to season of fire in an aseasonal, fire-prone
   fynbos shrubland}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Season of fire has marked effects on floristic composition in fire-prone
   Mediterranean climate shrublands. In these winter-rainfall systems,
   summer-autumn fires lead to optimal recruitment of overstorey proteoid
   shrubs (non-sprouting, slow-maturing, serotinous Proteaceae) which are
   important to the conservation of floral diversity. We lexplored whether
   fire season has similar effects on early establishment of five proteoid
   species in the eastern coastal part of the Cape Floral Kingdom (South
   Africa) where rainfall occurs year-round and where weather conducive to
   fire and the actual incidence of fire are largely aseasonal. We surveyed
   recruitment success (ratio of post-fire recruits to pre-fire parents) of
   proteoids after fires in different seasons. We also planted proteoid
   seeds into inexclosures, designed to prevent predation by small mammals
   and birds, cleared (intended to simulate fire) fynbos shrublands at
   different sites in each of four seasons and monitored their germination
   and survival to one year post-planting (hereafter termed `recruitment'),
   Factors (in decreasing order of importance) affecting recruitment
   success in the post-fire surveys were species, pre-fire parent density,
   post-fire age of the vegetation at the time of assessment, and fire
   season, whereas rainfall (for six months post-fire) and fire return
   interval (>7 years) had little effect. In the seed-planting experiment,
   germination occurred during the cooler months and mostly within two
   months of planting, except for summer-plantings, which took 2-3 months
   longer to germinate. Although recruitment success differed significantly
   among planting seasons, sites and species, significant interactions
   occurred among the experimental factors, In both the post-fire surveys
   and seed planting experiment, recruitment success in relation to fire-
   or planting season varied greatly within and among species and sites.
   Results of these two datasets were ftirthermore inconsistent, suggesting
   that proteoid recruitment responses are not related to the season of
   fire. Germination appeared less rainfall-dependent than in
   winter-rainfall shrublands, suggesting that summer drought-avoiding
   dormancy is limited and has less influence on variation in recruitment
   success among fire seasons. The varied response of proteoid recruitment
   to fire season (or its simulation) implies that burning does not have to
   be restricted to particular seasons in eastern coastal fynbos, affording
   more flexibility for fire management than in shrublands associated with
   winter rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{European larch is a dominant species in the subalpine belt of the
   western Alps. Despite recent increases in wildfire activity in this
   region, fire ecology of European larch is poorly understood compared to
   other larch species around the world. This study aims to assess whether
   European larch forests are resilient to fires, and to find out the
   factors that drive such resilience. We assessed the recovery of larch
   forests along a gradient of fire severity (low, moderate, high) based on
   the abundance and dominance of post-fire larch regeneration. We
   established 200 plots distributed among burned larch forests in nine
   wildfires that occurred between 1973 and 2007 in the western Alps. We
   included variables regarding topography, climate, fire severity, fire
   legacies, ground cover, grazing intensity, and time since fire. To
   evaluate potential drivers of larch recruitment, we applied generalized
   linear mixed models (GLMM) and random forests (RF). Larch regeneration
   was much more abundant and dominant in the moderate- and high-severity
   fire classes than in the low-severity class. More than half of the plots
   in the moderate- and high-severity classes were classified as resilient,
   i.e., post-fire larch regeneration was enough to recover a larch stand.
   GLMM and RF produced complementary results: fire severity and legacies,
   such as snags, canopy cover and distance to seed source, were crucial
   factors explaining post-fire larch recruitment. This study shows that
   fire has a positive effect on larch regeneration, and we conclude that
   European larch forests are highly resilient to mixed-severity fires in
   the western Alps.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Post-fire recovery trajectories in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   Laws.) forests of the southwestern United States are increasingly
   shifting away from pre-burn vegetation communities. This study
   investigated whether phenological metrics derived from a multi-decade
   remotely sensed imagery time-series could differentiate among grass,
   evergreen shrub, deciduous, or conifer-dominated replacement pathways.
   We focused on 10 fires that burned ponderosa pine forests in Arizona and
   New Mexico, USA before the year 2000. A total of 29 sites with
   discernable post-fire recovery signals were selected within
   high-severity burn areas. At each site, we used Google Earth Engine to
   derive time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   signals from Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and
   Operational Land Imager data from 1984 to 2017. We aggregated values to
   8- and 16-day intervals, fit Savitzky-Golay filters to each sequence,
   and extracted annual phenology metrics of amplitude, base value, peak
   value, and timing of peak value in the TIMESAT analysis package. Results
   showed that relative to post-fire conditions, pre-burn ponderosa pine
   forests exhibit significantly lower mean NDVI amplitude (0.14 vs. 0.21),
   higher mean base NDVI (0.47 vs. 0.22), higher mean peak NDVI (0.60 vs.
   0.43), and later mean peak NDVI (day of year 277 vs. 237). Vegetation
   succession pathways exhibit distinct phenometric characteristics as
   early as year 5 (amplitude) and as late as year 20 (timing of peak
   NDVI). This study confirms the feasibility of leveraging phenology
   metrics derived from long-term imagery time-series to identify and
   monitor ecological outcomes. This information may be of benefit to land
   resource managers who seek indicators of future landscape compositions
   to inform management strategies.}},

   streams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{192-201}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Clearcutting and wildfire are the two major edge-creating
   disturbances in boreal forests. While clearcutting retains at least a 30
   m buffer, wildfires burn close to streams killing most of the trees and
   potentially creating a different edge structure. Different edge
   structures are likely to support different plant assemblages. The
   riparian buffer and fire edge structures and their effects on plant
   assemblages are unknown, but they have implications for forest
   management that aims to harvest trees and conserve biodiversity by
   emulating natural disturbance.
   2. We hypothesized that environmental filters created by post-fire
   residual structures at the fire edge will support a different plant
   assemblage than the buffer edge. We further hypothesized that the fire
   edge with a weaker environmental filter because of post-fire residual
   structures and proximity to streams will result in lower depth of edge
   effects (DEEs) and magnitude of edge effects (MEEs) than buffer edges.
   3. We determined the structure of canopy trees, understorey cover and
   the near-ground microclimate by sampling 576 (5 x 10 m) and 1820 (1 x 1
   m) quadrats along 96 transects beside 24 streams near Thunder Bay,
   Canada. We determined DEEs and MEEs by comparing edge variables with
   reference forests. We used repeated measures/factorial anovas with
   Tukey's post hoc tests to determineDEEs and manova forMEEs.
   4. The average microclimatic DEEs extended 8 m into the buffer but only
   2 5 m from the fire edge. Similarly, the DEEs for plant life-forms
   extended 20 m from the buffer edge and 5 m from the fire edge. At the
   fire edge, the structural MEEs were significantly higher, but the
   microclimatic MEEs were lower than the buffer edge. We found no
   significant difference in the overall life-form MEEs, but shrubs,
   shade-tolerant herbs and grasses were increased at the buffer edge and
   decreased at the fire edge.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We discovered that the ecological
   structure at buffer and fire edges in boreal forests creates different
   environmental filters supporting different plant assemblages. Lower
   structural and microclimaticDEEs andMEEs at the fire edge result from(i)
   edge location, (ii) intact shrub layer and (iii) disturbance-resilient
   riparian vegetation. We suggest that replacing the conventional sharp
   edges of the riparian clear-cut buffer with `feathered' edges by
   selective harvesting of trees will create wider edges mimicking wildfire
   legacy and will help to emulate natural disturbance for conserving
   biodiversity.}},

   deciduous broadleaved species. Model goodness-of-fit varied, with the
   poorest fit generally associated with fire-tolerant species and best fit
   generally associated with fire sensitive species. The information

Abstract = {{Wildfires are a recurrent disturbance in the Mediterranean Basin.
   However, managers from this region are confronted with a lack of
   information on the effects of fire on most woody species, which is
   required for defining sustainable forest management strategies.
   Following a large wildfire in central Portugal (2003), we surveyed the
   area during the first year and assessed the vegetative condition of 1040
   burned trees from 11 different species. Among those trees, 755
   individuals were selected and monitored annually for 4 years. At the end
   of the study, almost all the broadleaved trees survived, while most
   coniferous died. In spite of the low mortality observed in broadleaves,
   most were top-killed and regenerated only from basal resprouts, which
   implies a slow recovering process. Quercus suber, however, showed
   vigorous post-fire crown resprouting and was the most resilient species.
   We fitted logistic regression models to predict the probability of
   individual tree mortality and top-kill from fire injury indicators and
   tree characteristics. Besides the differences between the two main
   functional groups (coniferous, broadleaved), bole char height and crown
   volume scorched or consumed were important predictors of tree responses.
   Additionally, the main factor determining crown mortality on broadleaved
   species was bark thickness. The selected models performed well when
   tested with independent data obtained on four other wildfires. These
   models have several potential applications and can be useful to managers
   making pre-fire or post-fire decisions in mixed forest stands in the
   western Mediterranean Basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   ethylene on germination of R. coriaria seeds, in order to identify the
   causes of this unique germination pattern, Pre-heating to 120-140
   degrees C for 15 min was essential for the induction of seed
   germination, Germination percentage was increased by ash cover of 1.2
   and 2.4 kg m(-2) (1 and 2 cm, respectively) but inhibited by ash cover
   of 6.0 kg m(-2) (5 cm), Wet pine ash from a recently burned forest had
   pH of 10 and psi(pi) of -0.26 MPa. Under such conditions the germination
   of R, coriaria was reduced by ca 80\%, On the other hand, germination
   was stimulated by 0.03-0.10 p.p.m, ethylene which was released by wet
   ash, The post-fire germination of R, cor inr ia is regulated by the
   balance between the stimulating effects of fire heat and the ethylene
   released by the ash, and the inhibition caused by the high pH and the
   low psi(pi) caused by the ash, Its mode of dispersal by birds and these

   30 years after fire from the regeneration monitored during the first
   years after fire. The results show that, although the three pine species
   regenerate quite well in the absence of fire, their post-fire
   regeneration is very different: P. halepensis shows high seedling
   density after fire, but P. nigra and P. sylvestris almost disappear from
   burned plots. The model simulations of the future forest composition 30
   years after fire indicate that 77-93\% of plots dominated by these two
   pines change after fire to communities dominated by oaks (Quercus ilex,
   Q. cerrioides). There is also a considerable number (7-16\%) of these
   burned pine plots that change to shrublands. Thus, these observational
   and modelling results suggest that large fire events, which have
   increased considerably in the Mediterranean region in the last decades,
   may decrease the overall distribution of these pine species, especially
   that of P.nigra and P. sylvestris.}},

Abstract = {{Despite Mediterranean ecosystems' high resilience to fire, both climate
   and land use change, and alterations in fire regimes increase their
   vulnerability to fire by affecting the long-termnatural recovery of
   ecosystem services. The objective of this work is to study the effects
   of fire severity on biochemical soil indicators, such as chemical
   composition or enzymatic activity, related to time after fire and
   natural vegetation recovery (soil-plant interphase). Soil samples from
   three wildfires occurring 3, 15 and 21 years ago were taken in the
   south-eastern Iberian Peninsula (semiarid climate). Sampling included
   three fire severity levels in naturally regenerated (and changing to
   shrublands) Pinus halepensis Mill. forests.
   In the short-term post-fire period, phosphorus concentration, electrical
   conductivity and urease activity were positively linked to fire
   severity, and also influenced beta-glucosidade activity in a negative
   relationship. During the 15-21-year post-fire period, the effects
   related to medium-high fire severity were negligible and soil quality
   indicators were linked to natural regeneration success. The results
   showed that most soil properties recovered in the long term after fire
   (21 years).
   These outcomes will help managers and stakeholders to implement
   management tools to stabilise soils and to restore burned ecosystems
   affected by medium-high fire severity. Such knowledge can be considered
   in adaptive forest management to reduce the negative effects of
   wildfires and desertification, and to improve the resilience of
   vulnerable ecosystems in a global change scenario. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Climate change has increased the occurrence, severity, and impact of
   disturbances on forested ecosystems worldwide, resulting in a need to
   identify factors that contribute to an ecosystem's resilience or
   capacity to recover from disturbance. Forest resilience to disturbance
   may decline with climate change if mature trees are able to persist
   under stressful environmental conditions that do not permit successful
   recruitment and survival after a disturbance. In this study, we used the
   change in proportional representation of black spruce pre- to post-fire
   as a surrogate for resilience. We explored links between patterns of
   resilience and tree ring signals of drought stress across topographic
   moisture gradients within the boreal forest. We sampled 72 recently
   (2004) burned stands of black spruce in interior Alaska (USA); the
   relative dominance of black spruce after fire ranged from almost no
   change (high resilience) to a 90\% decrease (low resilience). Variance
   partitioning analysis indicated that resilience was related to site
   environmental characteristics and climate-growth responses, with no
   unique contribution of pre-fire stand composition. The largest shifts in
   post-fire species composition occurred in sites that experienced the
   compounding effects of pre-fire drought stress and shallow post-fire
   organic layer thickness. These sites were generally located at warmer
   and drier landscape positions, suggesting they are less resilient to
   disturbance than sites in cool and moist locations. Climate-growth
   responses can provide an estimate of stand environmental stress to
   climate change and as such are a valuable tool for predicting landscape
   variations in forest ecosystem resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of hectares of conifer plantations are affected every year by
   wildfire and subsequent erosion in the Mediterranean region. However,
   little is known about how post-fire erosion is influenced by the
   mechanical site preparation (MSP) techniques used at plantation
   establishment. Such information is needed for planning further
   reforestation, for reducing the hydrological impact of wildfire and
   subsequent soil degradation, and for favouring the natural resilience of
   perturbed ecosystems. Here we present a study conducted in NW Spain to
   evaluate how two MSP techniques commonly used at plantation
   establishment- hole planting and contour rip-plowing-, affected
   post-wildfire soil erosion and some edaphic properties (carbon content,
   penetration resistance, bulk density and aggregate stability) compared
   to the absence of intervention. The possible relationships between the
   soil properties and post-fire soil erosion were also examined. Finally,
   the effectiveness of erosion barriers, installed in burned sites
   originally established by hole planting and contour rip-plowing was
   evaluated. At the end of the two-year long study period, the accumulated
   soil loss was significantly lower in the contour rip-plowing treatment
   (0.7 Mg ha(-1)) than in the hole planting treatment (6.7 Mg ha(-1)) and
   the no intervention treatment (4.9 Mg ha(-1)), but did not differ in the
   latter two treatments. Erosion barriers did not reduce post-fire soil
   erosion, which varied from 2.1 Mg ha(-1) in the contour rip-plowing +
   erosion barriers treatment to 8.3 Mg ha(-1) in the hole planting +
   erosion barriers treatment. Soil loss was related to soil burn severity.
   No significant relationship was observed between sediment production and
   any of the soil properties considered. The recovery of vegetation cover
   was not affected by the site preparation technique used. The study
   findings can be applied to reforestation planning and post-fire
   emergency stabilization actions.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{573}},
Pages = {{1242-1254}},

Abstract = {{Mulching is an effective post-fire soil erosion mitigation treatment.
   Experiments with forest residue mulch have demonstrated that it
   increased ground cover to 70\% and reduced runoff and soil loss at small
   spatial scales and for short post-fire periods. However, no studies have
   systematically assessed the joint effects of scale, time since burning,
   and mulching on runoff, soil loss, and organic matter loss. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of scale and forest
   residue mulch using 025 m(2) micro-plots and 100 m(2) slope-scale plots
   in a burnt eucalypt plantation in central Portugal. We assessed the
   underlying processes involved in the post-fire hydrologic and erosive
   responses, particularly the effects of soil moisture and soil water
   repellency.
   Runoff amount in-the micro-plots was more than ten-fold the runoff in
   the larger slope-scale plots in the first year and decreased to
   eight-fold in the third post-fire year. Soil losses in the micro-plots
   were initially about twice the values in the slope-scale plots and this
   ratio increased over time. The mulch greatly reduced the cumulative soil
   loss measured in the untreated slope-scale plots (616 g m(-2)) by 91\%
   during the five post-fire years. The implications are that applying
   forest residue mulch immediately after a wildfire can reduce soil losses
   at spatial scales of interest to land managers throughout the expected
   post-fire window of disturbance, and that mulching resulted in a
   substantial relative gain in soil organic matter. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Pages = {{272-285}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation and soils on fluvial deposits of different ages were used to
   describe ecosystem development over millennia at a well-drained taiga
   site in the central Alaska Range. The youngest geomorphic surfaces are
   not forested, and lie in the active floodplain where they are disturbed
   by ice jams and flooding. Older surfaces are forested, and fires
   recurring every 40-60 years are the dominant disturbance. Soil
   properties change little after aforestation due to disturbance from
   loess deposition and fire. Plant species able to resprout from roots
   following fires increase in importance with surface age. After about
   4000 years, soils and vegetation reach a stable state where frequently
   burning, aspen/white spruce/ericaceous shrub vegetation grows on
   well-drained, poorly developed soils. We infer that this ecosystem
   perpetuates itself through positive feedback involving clonal
   reproduction, vegetation's effects on the fire regime, and fire's
   effects on halting soil development and preventing the invasion of
   alternate plant communities. The brief fire-return interval and the
   abundance of clonal species indicate that secondary succession consists
   mainly of the immediate re-establishment of pre-fire dominants. The
   widely described scheme for post-fire succession in the Alaskan taiga

   occur here or at similar sites.}},

Abstract = {{Recent large fires have highlighted the importance of understanding

   ecologically sound post-fire forest restoration practices. Restoration
   principles should be based on a thorough understanding and appropriate
   integration of the ecological, social, and economic factors associated

   forests, which provide habitats for pine mushrooms, a major source of
   income for local residents. Curculionid beetles can easily attack
   fire-damaged trees because of the trees' weakened defense mechanisms. On
   the other hand, fire accelerates the decomposition of organic matter and
   nutrient release, thereby improving forest productivity. Natural
   restoration after large fires depends on regeneration (e.g., from seeds
   and sprouts) of the remaining trees that have sustained less damage,
   until secondary forests are established. However, severely burned areas
   may require rapid artificial regeneration depending on the specific
   climatic (e.g., summer rainy season), geographic (e.g., shallow surface
   soil and land erosion), and economic (e.g., local mushroom harvesting)
   objectives. A restoration plan should include constructing fuel breaks

Abstract = {{Despite many Mediterranean species show efficient mechanisms to
   withstand fires, they are currently submitted to fire regimes
   characterized by anthropogenically increased levels of fire recurrence,
   which may overpass their recovery capacity. We studied fire recurrence
   effects on Pinus halepensis populations at a regional level in Catalonia
   (NE Iberian Peninsula), by comparing post-fire populations in paired
   areas once-burnt (1994) and twice-burnt (once from 1978 to 1991, and
   again in 1994). Survey was conducted 10 years after fire in 14 study
   sites: density, height, and diameter were recorded, and
   dendrochronological analyses were conducted to deal with time of
   recruitment and radial growth. In both types of areas, post-fire
   recruitment took place mainly just after the summer fire, in 1994 (87\%
   of individuals), and also in 1995 (12\%). Density was significantly
   lower in twice-burnt areas than in once-burnt ones, which is attributed
   to fire intervals shorter than 15 years, the minimum time-length
   required by R halepensis populations to recover pre-fire density levels.
   Height and diameter records evidenced a growth decline in twice-burnt
   areas. Dendrochronological analyses revealed that radial pine growth was
   lower in twice-burnt areas along the first post-fire years (from 1994 to
   1999), thus resulting in lower total radial growth than in once-burnt
   areas. Such radial growth differences are attributed to differences in
   soil nutrient availability along the first post-fire years (post-fire
   nutrient boom), resulting from differences in pre-fire fuel loads
   between once- and twice-burnt areas. According to our results, drastic
   changes in P halepensis forests in the western Mediterranean Basin are
   likely to be expected under fire regimes characterized by high levels of
   fire recurrence. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire, a primary natural disturbance in many forests, affects soil
   nutrient availability and spatial distributions of forest plants.
   However, post-fire changes in soil nutrients and spatial patterns of
   understory environments at fine scales are poorly understood. Here, we
   characterized spatial patterns of soil nitrogen availability and site
   characteristics at a 3-year-post-fire and an unburned site in a valley
   boreal larch forest. We also examined the relationship between soil
   nitrogen availability and site characteristics. The results showed that
   the burned site had higher NO3- and lower NH4+ than the control. The
   herb, litter and coarse wood debris cover was greater at the burned site
   than at the control site with higher soil pH, depth of the organic
   horizon (DOH) and shrub cover. Relative variability (coefficient of
   variation) in soil nitrogen and site characteristic variables at the
   control site was greater than at the burned site except for shrub and
   regeneration tree seedling cover. Spatial structure (quantified by
   semi-variograms) was lacking for soil nitrogen and site characteristic
   variables except for DOH, herb and shrub cover at the control site, but
   wildfire created a strong spatial structure for all variables. Shorter
   spatial autocorrelation ranges of soil nitrogen (1.6-3.5 m) and site
   characteristic variables (2.6-6.0 m) were detected at the burned site,
   indicating higher heterogeneity. The spatial scale of soil NH4+ was
   congruent with those of herb, shrub and regeneration tree seedling
   cover, indicating local coupling, while that of soil NO3- was not. The
   number of correlations between soil nitrogen and site characteristic
   variables in the burned site was greater than in the control. These
   results indicate that fire could not only create higher heterogeneity
   patches of soil resources, but also strengthen the local coupling
   between soil resources and understory vegetation, which may impact the
   establishment and growth of new individual plants.}},

Abstract = {{As large, high-severity forest fires increase and snowpacks become more
   vulnerable to climate change across the western USA, it is important to
   understand post-fire disturbance impacts on snow hydrology. Here, we
   examine, quantify, parameterize, model, and assess the post-fire
   radiative forcing effects on snow to improve hydrologic modelling of
   snow-dominated watersheds having experienced severe forest fires.
   Following a 2011 high-severity forest fire in the Oregon Cascades, we
   measured snow albedo, monitored snow, and micrometeorological
   conditions, sampled snow surface debris, and modelled snowpack energy
   and mass balance in adjacent burned forest (BF) and unburned forest
   sites. For three winters following the fire, charred debris in the BF
   reduced snow albedo, accelerated snow albedo decay, and increased
   snowmelt rates thereby advancing the date of snow disappearance compared
   with the unburned forest. We demonstrate a new parameterization of
   post-fire snow albedo as a function of days-since-snowfall and net
   snowpack energy balance using an empirically based exponential decay
   function. Incorporating our new post-fire snow albedo decay
   parameterization in a spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow
   model, we show significantly improved predictions of snow cover duration
   and spatial variability of snow water equivalent across the BF,
   particularly during the late snowmelt period. Field measurements, snow
   model results, and remote sensing data demonstrate that charred forests
   increase the radiative forcing to snow and advance the timing of snow
   disappearance for several years following fire. Copyright (c) 2016 John

   sites. Y-O-Y Northern Pike were significantly larger at the unburned
   sites (P<0.01) and the relative abundance of Y-O-Y Northern Pike
   increased significantly at burned sites (alpha=0.1; P<0.07) following
   re-vegetation two years post fire. These differences may be due to
   fire-induced changes in physical habitat or food availability. Forest
   tires decrease the density of riparian vegetation, which likely provides
   better spawning and rearing habitat for Northern Pike in the long-term.}},

Abstract = {{As wildfires in much of the western United States increase in size,
   frequency, and severity, understanding the impact of these fires on
   water yield from forested headwater basins is essential to successful
   management of water resources. The current study examines the changes in
   partitioning of the hydrologic cycle in the Mill Creek Basin that follow
   the Chippy Creek Fire in Montana, USA, due to alterations to the
   vegetative regime. The analysis utilizes remote sensing-based vegetation
   indices and evapotranspiration, a model-interpolated precipitation
   product, and discharge data to assess annual water budgets and
   vegetative regimes in the Mill Creek Basin. After being almost 90\%
   burned in the Chippy Creek Fire, vegetation in the catchment has shifted
   from almost exclusively mixed conifer forest to sagebrush scrubs and
   grasses. This shift in vegetation is accompanied by abrupt shifts in
   partitioning of the water budget, resulting in an altered ecohydrologic
   regime. Post-fire, evapotranspiration decreases annually by 250 mm
   (46\%), and evaporative fraction decreases by 0.53. However,
   evapotranspiration product biases may overestimate this decrease from
   pre- to post-fire. This decrease in evapotranspiration results in an
   annual increase in streamflow of 136 mm, a 21\% increase in the runoff
   ratio, and a 140\% increase in water yield. These changes to the water
   budget are consistent for 10 years post-fire and show no trend towards
   pre-fire values during the study period. Results will help inform
   planning and management of water resources downstream of forested
   catchments that have been impacted by wildfire.}},

   productivity with fire severity could not offset the decrease in tree
   productivity in severely burned stands where tree sapling density was

Abstract = {{Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are well-known to occur at
   higher densities in recently burned forests than they do in nearby green
   forests. In the forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, there is
   relatively little information on the types of nest trees that these
   birds use in recently burned forests. From 2009 to 2011, we studied
   nest-tree preference by black-backed woodpeckers in 2 burned forests in
   the northern Sierra Nevada. For each of 31 nest trees and 389 randomly
   selected trees, we recorded decay class, diameter at breast height, top
   condition, and species. We also recorded the number of snags with >23 cm
   diameter at breast height within an 11.3-m radius of each nest tree and
   randomly selected tree. We evaluated nest-tree preference by comparing
   the characteristics of nest trees to randomly selected trees.
   Black-backed woodpeckers preferred dead but not heavily decayed trees
   and moderate (29-61 cm dbh) diameter trees. There was no evidence that
   black-backed woodpeckers had strong preferences for trees with broken
   tops or trees of particular species. Snag density around nest trees was
   higher than around randomly selected trees. Our results suggest that in

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation structure is an integral component of avian habitat
   selection. Therefore, structure changes caused by management practices
   can influence avian communities. The salt marshes of the pampas region
   of Argentina have experienced an increase in fire use as a management
   tool to improve cattle forage and to avoid accidental fires. A spring
   burn of 200 ha of salt marsh in Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve,
   Argentina, in September 1995, allowed us to compare the response of
   birds associated with two vegetation communities, one dominated by
   Spartina densiflora (Spartina marsh) and another dominated by Juncus
   acutus (Juncus marsh) from one month to one year post-burn. We recorded
   changes in plant species composition and vegetation structure (height
   and cover) at 40 days after the burn and every season for the subsequent
   year. Fire reduced total cover of both plant communities. Juncus marsh
   recovered pre-burn structure and bird community by one year post-fire.
   However, Spartina marsh recovery was incomplete in that period. Relative
   abundances of bird species that used unburned Juncus marsh were similar
   to those in burned Juncus marsh in the spring period one year after the
   burn. Plant height at the burned Spartina marsh did not reach that of
   the unburned Spartina in 12 months; red-capped wren-spinetail
   (Spartonoica maluroides), a rare tall-grass-dependent species, settled
   burned parcels at lower relative abundances than in unburned habitat.
   Because species that first use the burned patches are very common and
   widespread in other habitats, and excessive burning may reduce available
   habitat for endangered or rare species, prescribed burns should be
   avoided in this region.}},

   post fire?}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Wildfire is an important ecological process in mixed conifer
   forests of the Intermountain West region of the USA. However,
   researchers and managers are concerned because climate warming has led
   to increased fire activity in recent decades. More area burned will
   result in larger land areas in early successional stages and will
   potentially limit tree establishment; therefore, evaluating long-term
   forest understory response to fire is important. We evaluate the impact
   of burn severity, overstory canopy cover, topography, and climate on
   understory plant community diversity and composition in seven wildfires,
   9 to 12 years post fire, along a broad climate gradient from dry to
   moist mixed conifer forests in Idaho, Montana, and Washington, USA.
   Results: Climate was the most important driver for species diversity and
   composition, but a burn severity gradient was detectable in the species
   data one decade post fire. A strong overlap in species composition
   between burn severity levels was documented, but dispersion was lower
   for high burn severity sites, indicating that those sites are still
   recovering. Local species richness and diversity had a nonlinear
   relationship with the burn severity index dNBR, with a maximum at low to
   moderate burn severity; the relationship was stronger in moist climates.
   Functional trait analysis revealed higher grass and forb cover in
   high-severity burns, higher cover of tree seedlings, residual and
   off-site colonizers in burned areas, and more shade-tolerant species in
   unburned areas. Of the 270 species recorded, 10\% were introduced;
   however, only three were of noxious status and two were invasive annual
   grasses, generally occurring on dry sites.
   Conclusions: The understory plant community was not fundamentally
   altered by these fires and fire contributed to increased species
   diversity both locally and regionally, suggesting that low to moderate
   burn severity fire is a treatment that contributes to long-term
   maintenance of a diverse and productive understory. Individual species
   traits were significant drivers of understory species assemblages and,
   as future change in climate and fire regimes leads to shifts in species
   composition, anticipation of consequences will be important. Although
   invasive species occurred at low cover levels, noxious weeds and
   invasive annual grasses will continue to be management challenges,
   particularly in dry regions of mixed conifer forests.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean Basin, wildland fires are major drivers of forest
   ecosystem dynamics. In the current context of global change, these fires
   are becoming more severe and recurrent because of climatic conditions,
   land use changes and invasive species. In areas affected by mega-fires
   (burned area > 10,000 ha), the patterns of regeneration may be
   heterogeneous due to local variations in fire regime, community
   composition and environmental features. The goal of this study was to
   analyze the post-fire structure of both Pinus pinaster Aiton. seedlings
   population and understory community in a Mediterranean fire-prone
   ecosystem at short-term by means of high spatial resolution satellite
   imagery within the perimeter of a full stand replacing mega-fire that
   burned around 12,000 ha of a Pinus pinaster forest in NW Spain. We
   established 234 field plots of 2 x 2 meters to cover four
   recurrence-severity scenarios. In each plot, we sampled 15 vegetation
   structural variables at both pine seedlings population and understory
   community levels. From the WorldView-2 satellite imagery, we obtained
   three sets of spectral variables (reflectance, spectral indices and
   image textures) that were used as predictors of vegetation recovery in
   generalized linear models. At population level, the number and cover of
   pine seedlings were successfully modeled with spectral indices and
   textural information (normalized root mean square error of 16\% and
   17\%, respectively). At understory community level, woody species cover
   was correlated with first order textures (normalized root mean square
   error of 9\%). Other understory structure variables (height and richness
   of woody species, percentage of bare soil, necromass and leaves) were
   predicted with an error lower than 20\%. The predictive capacity of the
   models was similar for all recurrence-severity scenarios. Our results
   highlight the usefulness of spectral indices and textural data at high
   spatial resolution in the analysis of post-fire recovery in large and
   heterogeneous burnt areas. Given the accuracy and predictive capacity of
   the models obtained in this study, high spatial resolution satellite
   imagery together with field data provide useful information in post-fire
   decision making in fire prone ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{There has been considerable interest in the recent literature regarding
   the assessment of post-fire effects on forested areas within the North
   American boreal forest. Assessing the physical and ecological effects of
   fire in boreal forests has far-reaching implications for a variety of
   ecosystem processes - such as post-fire forest succession - and land
   management decisions. The present paper reviews past assessments and the
   studies presented in this special issue that have largely been based on
   the Composite Burn Index and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR).
   Results from relating and mapping fire/burn severity within the boreal
   region have been variable, and are likely attributed, in part, to the
   wide variability in vegetation and terrain conditions that are
   characteristic of the region. Satellite remote sensing of post-fire
   effects alone without proper field calibration should be avoided. A
   sampling approach combining field and image values of burn condition is
   necessary for successful mapping of fire/burn severity. Satellite-based
   assessments of fire/burn severity, and in particular dNBR and related
   indices, need to be used judiciously and assessed for appropriateness
   based on the users' need. Issues unique to high latitudes also need to
   be considered when using satellite-derived information in the boreal

Abstract = {{Although several studies deal with the impact of fire on Mediterranean
   fauna, and with the post-fire patterns of recolonisation by this fauna,
   the impact of fire on land snail communities has never been studied. Yet
   land snails constitute a good model to study the impact of fire and the
   subsequent patterns of recolonisation, because they are highly sensitive
   to fire and have low abilities to disperse. The aims of the present
   study were to assess the short- and long-term impacts of one single fire
   on land snail communities, and to study the patterns of post-fire
   recolonisation at the community level. A stratified sampling was carried
   out, in Provence garrigues and forests, according to the age of fire and
   to the distance from the burned/unburned boundaries, or from vegetation
   refuges or stony areas. Data were studied using Correspondence Analysis
   and Shannon diversity index.
   Fire caused a marked decrease in land snail abundance. Nevertheless,
   about one year after the fire, all the ecological groups were again
   represented, and the species richness was little affected. Five years
   after the fire, the abundance of the land snails seemed to reach an
   equilibrium. However, our results do not agree with the working
   hypothesis that recolonisation by land snails progresses from refuges
   such as the boundaries of the burned areas, vegetation patches spared by
   the fire, or stony areas. The composition of the post-fire land snail
   communities seemed to mainly depend on the post-fire habitat structure.
   The post-fire colonisation by snails seemed to proceed from numerous
   scattered refuges that result from the spatial heterogeneity of the
   fire, and that were difficult to locate.}},

Abstract = {{Fire injury can increase tree susceptibility to some bark beetles
   (Curculionidae, Scolytinae), but whether wildfires can trigger outbreaks
   of species such as mountain pine beetle (Den-droctonus ponderosae
   Hopkins) is not well understood. We monitored 1173 lodgepole (Pinus
   contorta var. latifolia Doug.) and 599 ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Doug.
   ex Law) pines for three years post-wildfire in the Uinta Mountains of
   northeastern Utah in an area with locally endemic mountain pine beetle.
   We examined how the degree and type of fire injury influenced beetle
   attacks, brood production, and subsequent tree mortality, and related
   these to beetle population changes over time. Mountain pine beetle
   population levels were high the first two post-fire years in lodgepole
   pine, and then declined. In ponderosa pine, populations declined each
   year after initial post-fire sampling. Compared to trees with strip or
   failed attacks, mass attacks occurred on trees with greater fire injury,
   in both species. Overall, a higher degree of damage to crowns and boles
   was associated with higher attack rates in ponderosa pines, but
   additional injury was more likely to decrease attack rates in lodgepole
   pines. In lodgepole pine, attacks were initially concentrated on
   fireinjured trees, but during subsequent years beetles attacked
   substantial numbers of uninjured trees. In ponderosa pine, attacks were
   primarily on injured trees each year, although these stands were more
   heavily burned and had few uninjured trees. In total, 46\% of all
   lodgepole and 56\% of ponderosa pines underwent some degree of attack.
   Adult brood emergence within caged bole sections decreased with
   increasing bole char in lodgepole pine but increased in ponderosa pine,
   however these relationships did not scale to whole trees. Mountain pine
   beetle populations in both tree species four years post-fire were
   substantially lower than the year after fire, and wildfire did not
   result in population outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Rising economic demands for boreal forest resources along with current
   and predicted increases in wildfire activity have increased salvage
   logging of burned forests. Currently, the ecological consequences of
   post-fire salvage logging are insufficiently understood to develop
   effective management guidelines or to adequately inform policy
   decision-makers.
   We used both field and laboratory studies to examine the effects of
   post-fire salvage logging on populations of the white-spotted sawyer
   Monochamus scutellatus scutellatus (Say) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and
   its ecological function in boreal forest.
   Monochamus s. scutellatus adults were relatively abundant in both burned
   and clear-cut logged sites but were absent from salvage logged sites.
   An in situ mesocosm experiment showed that the abundance of M. s.
   scutellatus larvae in burned white spruce bolts was linked to changes in
   total organic nitrogen and carbon in mineral soil.
   Organic nutrient inputs in the form of M. s. scutellatus frass increased
   mineral soil microbial respiration rates by more than three-fold and
   altered the availability of nitrogen. Changes in nitrogen availability
   corresponded with decreased germination and growth of Epilobium
   angustifolium and Populus spp. but not Calamagrostis canadensis.
   Although the present study focused on local scale effects, the reported
   findings suggest that continued economic emphasis on post-fire salvage
   logging may have implications beyond the local scale for biodiversity

   regeneration are not always favourable. This study makes a post-fire
   assessment of the burned area in the forest of Fergoug in Mascara,
   western Algeria, which was ravaged by a large fire in 2003. We highlight
   the use made of remote sensing tools and their integration with a

   (October 1987), ALSAT-1 (August 2003 and October 2007) with data
   products from the ASTER satellite's digital terrain model. Through a GIS
   analysis combining normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVI)
   generated from satellite imagery with other data layers (forest maps,
   exposure maps, limits of burned areas, etc.), we were able to map
   changes in the study zone after the fire. The results, validated against
   ground-truth data, show remarkable natural regeneration in some local
   species, especially the Tetraclinis articulata thuya. Regeneration is
   much more evident on fairly gradual north-facing slopes: these are less
   exposed to summer heat and consequently store more soil moisture, which
   is essential to vegetation growth. Much less regeneration was observed
   on the southern and western slopes. The statistics produced indicate
   that areas with tree cover before the fire are now occupied by sparse
   matorral and maquis vegetation, which, if adequately protected and
   maintained, could quickly recover to reform the tree cover observed
   before the fire.}},

   trait in P. nigra and to describe how post-fire tree survival responds
   to tree size and fire effects in a 16-year-old plantation.
   Bark thickness was related to diameter at breast height and height in
   the stem. Metrics describing tree size and stem and crown damage were
   measured 1 year after prescribed burning in 259 trees. Tree survival was
   modeled with logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree
   analysis.
   Bark thickness increased linearly with diameter at breast height (dbh)
   and decreased with height in the stem. Tree survival was primarily a
   function of crown injury. Stem damage was an influent factor in small
   trees.
   Due to thinner bark and lower tolerance to crown damage, young P. nigra
   trees are less fire-resistant than other Mediterranean pines, e.g.,
   Pinus pinaster. Prescribed fire should not be attempted if dbh < 10 cm.
   Mechanical clearing is the treatment of choice in young stands with a
   significant shrub layer.}},

Title = {{Simulated Increases in Fire Activity Reinforce Shrub Conversion in a
   Southwestern US Forest}},
Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Fire exclusion in historically frequent-fire forests of the southwestern
   United States has altered forest structure and increased the probability
   of high-severity fire. Warmer and drier conditions, coupled with
   dispersal distance limitations, are impeding tree seedling establishment
   and survival following high-severity fire. High-severity patches are
   commonly dominated by non-forest vegetation, a state that can be
   reinforced by subsequent fire events. We sought to determine the
   influence of fire probability on post-fire vegetation development in a
   severely burned landscape in New Mexico, USA. We used LANDIS-II to
   simulate three fire probability scenarios-historical fire probability,
   contemporary fire probability, and the mean of the two-with contemporary
   climate. As fire probability increased, the mean size of the largest
   fires and the mean landscape fire severity increased. These changes in
   fire characteristics resulted in decreased total aboveground biomass and
   photosynthetic capacity on the landscape after 50 years. Additionally,
   the distribution of individual species biomass shifted, with early
   successional species, especially those that resprout after fire,
   increasing as a fraction of total biomass with increasing fire
   occurrence. Counter to empirical data, our simulations did not show a
   conifer establishment limitation, suggesting a source of uncertainty
   that will need to be addressed to improve projections of forest dynamics
   under future climate. Even without limited conifer regeneration,
   continued increases in fire frequency are likely to favor resprouting
   species and result in a loss of forest biomass and ecosystem
   productivity in this southwestern forest landscape.}},

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean territories, with their characteristic climate that
   implies long periods of drought and rains often concentrated in
   torrential episodes, forest managers are faced with a series of
   decisions that can be urgent after a wildfire, some of them strongly
   correlated with the degree of damage caused by fire. In this sense, the
   object of this study was to provide a fast and reliable tool for the
   initial assessment of post-fire severity in these kinds of territories,
   by means of remote sensing techniques. Using Landsat 8 imagery, we have
   calculated three fire severity indices (dNBR, RdNBR, and RBR) for nine
   fires occurred in the Valencia region, a typical Mediterranean area. For
   each index, post-fire severity classification thresholds have been
   obtained taking into account the following categories: unburned, low,
   moderate, and high. These thresholds have been validated using, as
   ground-reference, aerial photographs taken from a helicopter.
   Afterwards, the degree to which post-fire severity was influenced by
   factors associated with pre-fire vegetation was evaluated, using a
   variance analysis. This analysis served to compare the three indices in
   terms of their robustness against the influence of these factors. With
   the obtained data, and with the study of classification accuracies
   employing the Kappa statistic, we were able to propose the most suitable
   index for calculating post-fire severity in the Valencia region, along
   with its operating thresholds. The findings suggest that the results
   could be extrapolated to other areas of similar characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Models can be useful for predicting the hydrological impacts of natural
   phenomenon such as wildfires and to help implement effective post-fire
   land management options. In this research, the revised
   Morgan-Morgan-Finney (MMF) model was used to simulate runoff and soil
   erosion in recently burned maritime pine plantations with contrasting
   fire regimes, in a wet Mediterranean region of north-central Portugal.
   The MMF model was adapted for burnt areas by implementing seasonal
   changes in model parameters in order to accommodate seasonal patterns in
   runoff and soil erosion, attributed to changes in soil water repellency
   and vegetation recovery. The model was then evaluated by applying it for
   a total of 18 experimental micro-plots (0.25 m(2)) at 9 once burned and
   9 four times burned slopes, using both previously published and newly
   calibrated parameters, with observed data used to evaluate the
   robustness and wider applicability of each parameterization. The
   prediction of erosion was more accurate than that of runoff, with an
   overall Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.54. Slope angle and the soils'
   effective hydrological depth (which depends on vegetation and/or crop
   cover) were found to be the main parameters improving model outcomes,
   and different parameters were needed to differentiate between the two
   contrasting fire regimes. This case study showed that most existing
   benchmark parameters can be used to apply MMF in burned pine forest
   areas with moderate severity fires to support post fire management, but
   indicated that further efforts should focus on mapping soil depth and
   vegetation cover to improve these assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Pinyon and juniper have been expanding into sagebrush (Artemisia
   tridentata) ecosystems since settlement of the Great Basin around 1860.
   Herbaceous understory vegetation is eliminated as stand densities
   increase and the potential for catastrophic fires increases. Prescribed
   fire is increasingly used to remove trees and promote recovery of
   sagebrush ecosystems. We quantified the effects of prescribed fire,
   vegetation type, and time following fire on soil KCl extractable
   nitrogen and NaHCO3 extractable phosphorus in a pinyon-juniper woodland
   and its associated sagebrush ecosystem immediately before and for 4
   years after a spring prescribed burn. Potassium chloride extractable
   NH4+ and total inorganic-N increased immediately following prescribed
   fire, and extractable NO3- decreased immediately after the burn. In the
   surface layer (top 8 cm), extractable NH4+ remained elevated compared to
   the control through year 2 after the burn. By the first fall post-burn
   extractable NO3- and total extractable inorganic-N increased and
   remained elevated over the control through year 3 after the burn in the
   surface layer. For the entire soil profile (52 cm), the burn had no
   effect on NH4+, and the effects on total extractable inorganic-N were no
   longer significant after year 1. However, NO3- remained elevated over
   the control through year 2 post-fire for the soil profile. Near surface
   NaHCO3 extractable ortho-P increased immediately following fire, and
   remained elevated through year 2 post-fire. No fire effects were
   observed for extractable ortho-P in deeper horizons. Our data show that
   plant available nitrogen can remain elevated for extended periods
   following prescribed fire. This can influence regrowth and seedling
   establishment of native plant species, invasion of exotic plant species
   and, ultimately, site recovery potential. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background Wildfires in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon,
   Idaho, and western Montana, USA) have been immense in recent years,
   capturing the attention of resource managers, fire scientists, and the
   general public. This paper synthesizes understanding of the potential
   effects of changing climate and fire regimes on Pacific Northwest
   forests, including effects on disturbance and stress interactions,
   forest structure and composition, and post-fire ecological processes. We
   frame this information in a risk assessment context, and conclude with
   management implications and future research needs. Results Large and
   severe fires in the Pacific Northwest are associated with warm and dry
   conditions, and such conditions will likely occur with increasing
   frequency in a warming climate. According to projections based on
   historical records, current trends, and simulation modeling, protracted
   warmer and drier conditions will drive lower fuel moisture and longer
   fire seasons in the future, likely increasing the frequency and extent
   of fires compared to the twentieth century. Interactions between fire
   and other disturbances, such as drought and insect outbreaks, are likely
   to be the primary drivers of ecosystem change in a warming climate.
   Reburns are also likely to occur more frequently with warming and
   drought, with potential effects on tree regeneration and species
   composition. Hotter, drier sites may be particularly at risk for
   regeneration failures. Conclusion Resource managers will likely be
   unable to affect the total area burned by fire, as this trend is driven
   strongly by climate. However, fuel treatments, when implemented in a
   spatially strategic manner, can help to decrease fire intensity and
   severity and improve forest resilience to fire, insects, and drought.
   Where fuel treatments are less effective (wetter, high-elevation, and
   coastal forests), managers may consider implementing fuel breaks around
   high-value resources. When and where post-fire planting is an option,
   planting different genetic stock than has been used in the past may
   increase seedling survival. Planting seedlings on cooler, wetter
   microsites may also help to increase survival. In the driest topographic
   locations, managers may need to consider where they will try to
   forestall change and where they will allow conversions to vegetation
   other than what is currently dominant.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution, habitat preferences and population ecology of
   Pseudomys novaehollandiae in the Eastern Otways, Victoria, were studied
   from 1985 to 1989.  The species has a patchy distribution and was
   captured at only four sites in healthy woodland-open forest.  The
   population density of the species was low (0-3.1 ha-1) and the breeding
   season was from spring to summer.  The vegetation on two trapping grids
   was classified into five floristic groups.  Four small mammal species
   (Rattus lutreolus, Antechinus stuartii, Mus musculus and P.
   novaehollandiae) exhibited preferences for different floristic groups. 
   There was evidence that P. novaehollandiae interacted, or competed, with
   M. musculus in one floristic group.  Pseudomys novaehollandiae preferred
   two floristic groups which had high floristic diversity.  Within these
   groups the species was associated with low dense vegetation cover.  The
   decline of populations of P. novaehollandiae in this study is likely to
   be related to post-fire successional changes in the vegetation:  either
   to loss of plant species diversity, or to loss of particular species or
   to low vegetation cover.  Strategic burning of small areas within the
   preferred floristic vegetation is recommended to maintain a mosaic of

   surface fuel loads. After 5 years, fine woody debris (FWD) and coarse
   woody debris (CWD) increased similar to 1380\% and 980\% in unsalvaged

   total accumulation of CWD to 16 Mg ha(-1). In moderate-severity sites,

   regeneration in high-severity sites, regardless of salvage treatment, is

Abstract = {{The study developed models for predicting the post-fire tree survival in

   types of models were developed: a stand-level model to predict the
   degree of damage caused by a forest fire, and tree-level models to
   predict the probability of a tree to survive a forest fire. The models
   were based on forest inventory and fire data. The inventory data on
   forest stands were obtained from the second (1989-1990) and third
   (2000-2001) Spanish national forest inventories, and the fire data
   consisted of the perimeters of forest fires larger than 20 ha that
   occurred in Catalonia between the 2nd and 3rd measurement of the
   inventory plots. The models were based on easily measurable forest
   characteristics, and they permit the forest manager to predict the
   effect of stand structure and species composition on the expected
   damage. According to the stand level fire damage model, the relative
   damage decreases when the stand basal area or mean tree diameter
   increases. Conversely, the relative stand damage increases when there is
   a large variation in tree size, when the stand is located on a steep
   slope, and when it is dominated by pine. According to the tree level
   survival models, trees in stands with a high basal area, a large mean
   tree size and a small variability in tree diameters have a high survival
   probability. Large trees in dominant positions have the highest
   probability of surviving a fire. Another result of the study is the

   test broadly applicable and repeatable metrics of not only fire scar
   delineation but also post-fire land cover dynamics through exhaustive
   use of the Landsat satellite data archives, and then (2) explore how
   those metrics relate to various hydrologic and anthropogenic factors

   of every Landsat scene collected over the study region during the study

   dynamics for Everglades National Park fires greater than 1.6 ha in area.
   Median burn areas were compared across several landscape units of the

   unit and fire history. Some burned areas transitioned to open water,
   exhibiting water depths and dynamics that support transition mechanisms
   proposed in the literature. Classification tree techniques showed that

Abstract = {{Catastrophic fires in wet forest have been highlighted as examples of
   drivers that overcome community resilience by altering feedback
   processes such that ecosystems are shifted into alternative, often
   less-desirable stable states. Recent successive lava-ignited wildfires,
   in slow-growing evergreen Myrtaceae-dominated mesic and wet forests at
   Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, provided an ideal opportunity to examine
   how forest species' responses differ after single and repeated fires. In
   mesic (Metrosideros polymorpha-Dicranopteris linearis) and wet
   (Metrosideros-Cibotium glaucum) forests, the first fire was
   stand-replacing where 99\% of the dominant overstorey trees (M.
   polymorpha) were top-killed; however, nearly half of these individuals
   survived by basal sprouting. The second fire dramatically increased
   mortality by killing the basal sprouts. Similarly, native tree fern C.
   glaucum survival was significantly reduced after repeated fires in the
   wet forest. The composition of the understorey in both communities after
   repeated fires differed in unexpected ways from once-burned and unburned
   forests. Repeated fires resulted in lower tree survival and rapid
   occupation by aggressive herbaceous species, potentially limiting tree
   growth and recruitment. The expected consequence is that native forest
   recovery will be delayed or even prevented by feedback processes
   established post-fire serving to maintain novel treeless alternate

Abstract = {{As fire is inherent to boreal forest, sustainable forest management
   should consider emulating this disturbance type, taking into account the
   natural fire regime and the historical impact of humans. Fire often
   removes the dominant species and reveals mineral soil, which allows new
   species to spread on burned areas. Variable conditions provide habitat
   for many different species. Fire is sometimes necessary for the
   retention of species which do not regenerate in the absence of fire.
   Fire-damaged forest stands are often salvage logged. The necessity of
   this procedure can be disputed, as the cleaning may decrease
   biodiversity, favour pioneer herbs and shrubs which are highly
   competitive with tree regeneration, and disturb the ecosystem's nutrient
   cycle. The effect of burning and post-fire cleaning was studied. Ground
   vegetation was investigated during three subsequent years, 2004-2006, in
   Fire-damaged pine forest areas in North-western and Southeastern
   Estonia, both dry and wet site types. Fire occurred 10-12 years prior to
   the inventories in the first and 2-4 years in the latter. The vegetation
   survey took place on 2x2m squares undergoing three different treatments:
   Burnt and Cleaned (BC), Burnt and Uncleaned (BU) and Control (CO).
   Floral composition differed significantly between the treatments.
   Biodiversity was higher on burnt plots than in control plots in humid
   areas and lower in dry areas. On dry sites, Molinea caerulea and Calluna
   vulgaris benefit from cleaning, which may hamper pine regeneration.
   Prescribed burning on such sites can reduce the fire risk. On wet sites,
   there was no significant difference between pioneer and shade-tolerant
   species between cleaned and uncleaned areas. Whether cleaning after fire
   should be maintained as a management action therefore depends greatly on
   the forest site type and other circumstances, such as management
   objectives and surrounding stands.}},

Abstract = {{Fire plays an important role in terrestrial ecosystems. The burning of
   biomass affects carbon and water fluxes and vegetation distribution. To
   understand the effect of interactive processes of fire and ecological
   succession on surface carbon and water fluxes, this study employed the
   Community Land Model version 4.5 to conduct a series of experiments that
   included and excluded fire and dynamic vegetation processes. Results of
   the experiments that excluded the vegetation dynamics showed a global
   increase in net ecosystem production (NEP) in post-fire regions, whereas
   the inclusion of vegetation dynamics revealed a fire-induced decrease in
   NEP in some regions, which was depicted when the dominant vegetation
   type was changed from trees to grass. Carbon emissions from fires are
   enhanced by reduction in NEP when vegetation dynamics are considered;
   however, this effect is somewhat mitigated by the increase in NEP when
   vegetation dynamics are not considered. Fire-induced changes in
   vegetation modify the soil moisture profile because grasslands are more
   dominant in post-fire regions. This results in less moisture within the
   top soil layer than that in unburned regions, even though transpiration
   is reduced overall. These findings are different from those of previous
   fire model evaluations that ignored vegetation dynamics and thus
   highlight the importance of interactive processes between fires and
   vegetation dynamics in evaluating recent model developments.}},

   relationships between these factors and soil seedbank diversity remain
   largely unknown. Partitioning the influence of spatial and environmental
   variability from that of TSF, and explaining how these factors interact

   from sites ranging from 1 to 75 years since fire in a heathy-woodland
   ecosystem across the Otway Ranges in Victoria, Australia. We also
   measured spatial and environmental variability across sites to partition
   the influence of these variables and TSF on propagules available for
   recruitment. We found weak positive relationships between seedbank
   richness and TSF; however, these relationships varied across the
   landscape. We found composition did not change considerably over time,
   suggesting, in this ecosystem, pre-fire age is not strongly influencing
   propagules available for recruitment post-fire. Our results suggest that
   spatial and environmental variability influence seedbank composition
   more than TSF.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated whether a normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI), derived from 8-km-resolution National Oceanic Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) Pathfinder AVHRR (advanced very high resolution
   radiometer) land (PAL) data, is appropriate for monitoring recovery
   following large-scale forest fires. Recovery processes were examined
   after fires on the island of Borneo and in northeastern China in 1983
   and 1987, respectively. Based on pre- and post-fire NDVI differences
   (NDVId), six damage classes were established. Post-fire changes in land
   cover were monitored using (1) the average NDVI of all pixels
   corresponding to each damage class (A-NDVI) and (2) the ratio of a
   fire-affected A-NDVI to a non-fire-affected A-NDVI (QNDVI). Burn areas
   located by an NDVId threshold value were similar to reported burn areas.
   Both A-NDVI and QNDVI values signaled vegetation recovery, but the QNDVI
   gave much better results. For both the 1983 Borneo and 1987 northeastern
   China fires, QNDVI values dropped at the time of the fire and increased
   for about 4 years afterwards, although a 4-year period is obviously less
   than the time required for biomass recovery. Trends at the two study
   sites diverged after this period, however. The QNDVI values for multiple
   fire events in Borneo (in 1983, 1987, 1991, 1997, and 1998) showed that
   recovery times varied with the size of the burn area, but not with the
   damage class of the same event, whereas the severe-class QNDVI values
   for the fire in northeastern China in 1987 were still lower than the
   control value 10 years after the fire.}},

Abstract = {{Salvage logging has been proposed to reduce post-fire hazardous fuels
   and mitigate re-burn effects, but debate remains about its effectiveness
   when considering fuel loadings are dynamic, and re-burn occurrence is
   stochastic, in time. Therefore, evaluating salvage loggings capacity to
   reduce hazardous fuels requires estimating fuel loadings in
   unmanipulated and salvaged stands over long time periods. We sampled for
   snag dynamics, decomposition rates, and fuel loadings within
   unmanipulated high-severity portions of 7 fires, spanning a 24-year
   chronosequence, in dry-mixed conifer forests of Oregon's eastern
   Cascades. We used these estimates to program an empirical model
   predicting temporal dynamics of fine and coarse woody fuels from sources
   directly targeted by salvage logging. We simulated 1000 unmanipulated
   and salvage logging scenarios, with variable snag dynamic rates, for
   three sample plots spanning a pre-fire biomass gradient. Total surface
   fine woody fuel loadings peaked 17-18 years post-fire (6.76-9.92 Mg
   ha(-1)) in unmanipulated stands; thereafter decay losses exceeded input
   rates and loadings decreased. Salvage logging immediately increased
   surface fine woody fuel loadings by 160-237\% above maximum loadings
   observed in unmanipulated stands, and were higher during the initial
   18-22 years post-fire. 1000-h fuel loadings peaked 24-31 years post-fire
   in unmanipulated stands, but decomposition reduced total loadings by
   34.8-49.6\% of initial snag necromass by peak years. Our simulations
   suggest only 59.2\% (34.3 Mg ha(-1)), 47.8\% (44.3 Mg ha(-1)) and 223\%
   (37.6 Mg ha(-1)) of maximum 1000-h fuel loadings were available for
   combustion at this time. Available 1000-h fuel loadings in unmanipulated
   stands peaked 31,34 and 82 years post-fire but were only 35.4\% (40.7 Mg
   ha(-1)), 30.8\% (49.9 Mg ha(-1)) and 27.3\% (70.5 Mg ha(-1)) of initial
   snag necromass. Salvage logging increased 1000-h fuel loadings for the
   initial 7 years post-fire, but 80-84\% of initial snag necromass was
   removed or decayed when their maximum loadings were observed 17-22 years
   post-fire. Understory woody vegetation reestablished quickly following
   high-severity fire, creating another significant fuel layer and a source
   of post-fire fine woody fuels. Surface fuels accumulate quickly
   following high-severity fire, but our modeling results suggest salvage
   logging has mixed effects on reducing hazardous fuel conditions since it
   increases fine woody fuel loadings and decreases coarse woody fuel
   loadings. Reducing hazardous fuel loadings and their contribution to
   re-burn hazard requires manipulation of residual and future fuel
   sources, but treatment benefits should be evaluated against any negative
   effects to early seral forest structure and function if resilient forest
   ecosystems are the management goal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Fire can often occur in aquatic ecosystems, which may affect aquatic
   invertebrates. Despite the importance of aquatic invertebrates to
   ecosystem function, the effect of fire on these environments has been
   little studied. We studied the effects of fire on aquatic invertebrates
   in artesian springs in the arid zone of South Australia. Artesian
   springs are a unique and threatened ecosystem, containing several rare
   and endemic species. Evidence suggests these wetlands were routinely
   burnt by indigenous Aboriginal people before European settlement over
   100 years ago. Recently, burning has been suggested as a reinstated
   management tool to control the dominant reed Phragmites australis. A
   reduction in the cover of the reed may benefit the threatened flora and
   fauna through enhancement of water flow. Three artesian springs were
   burnt and aquatic invertebrates sampled from the burnt and three unburnt
   springs. A single fire in late winter completely burnt the dominant
   vegetation, followed by recovery of Phragmites over the following 2
   years. A single fire event did not deplete populations of endemic
   aquatic invertebrates in artesian springs, but probably did not
   substantially benefit these populations either. Isopods, amphipods,
   ostracods and three species of hydrobiid snail survived the fire event,
   and most had increased in number 1 month post fire but then returned to
   pre-burnt numbers by 1 year post fire. Morphospecies richness of all
   identified invertebrates increased over time in all springs, but did not
   differ appreciably between burnt and unburnt springs. If burning
   artesian springs is to be adopted as a management tool to suppress the
   growth of Phragmites australis, we conclude that the endemic aquatic
   invertebrates will survive a single burn event, without negative effect
   to their populations.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{453}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Following high-severity wildfire, application of mulch on the soil
   surface is commonly used to stabilize slopes and limit soil erosion
   potential, protecting ecosystem values at risk. Despite the widespread
   use of mulch, relatively little is known about its effects on ecosystem
   recovery and soil processes important for plant re-establishment.
   Following a high-severity wildfire in a Colorado lodgepole pine forest,
   we studied the effects of both mulch material and application rate on
   plant recovery and the relative importance of soil abiotic conditions
   and microbial substrate availability as drivers of plant community
   development over the first four years of recovery. Mulches were applied
   to experimental plots in a randomized complete block design immediately
   following the High Park Fire in July 2012. Treatments included wheat
   straw, wood strands, and wood shreds applied at two coverage rates
   (standard and high). Two controls, non-mulched and a microbially-neutral
   synthetic mulch, were included in each block to assess the relative
   importance of mulch effects on abiotic versus biotic dynamics. Plant and
   soil monitoring occurred at least annually for four-years post fire.
   Understory plants increased in total cover and shifted in composition
   over time, but these trends were largely unaffected by mulch type or
   application rate. Non-native understory plant species were not abundant
   at the end of this experiment, but their cover was higher in plots
   treated with wheat straw and high-rate wood strands compared to
   non-mulched control. Lodgepole pine seedling densities were higher in
   wood shred and mulched control treatments than in wheat straw and
   non-mulched control treatments. Because there were few effects of mulch
   treatments on plant available nitrogen, it is likely that effects of
   mulch on soil abiotic conditions (moisture and temperature) drove
   ecosystem responses in this system. Our findings indicate wood mulches
   can provide soil protection for many years and accelerate lodgepole pine
   establishment following wildfire with few negative near-term effects on
   plant recovery. In systems such as this, post-fire application of wood
   mulch can help managers meet site protection goals with minimal impacts
   on plant recovery.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{871-888}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Questions: How do species composition and abundance of soil seed bank
   and standing vegetation vary over the course of a post-fire succession
   in northern heathlands? What is the role of seed banks-do they act as a
   refuge for early successional species or call they simply be seen as a
   spillover from the extant local vegetation?
   Location: Coastal Calluna heathlands, Western Norway.
   Methods: We analysed vegetation and seed bank along a 24-year post-fire
   chronosequence. Patterns ill community composition, similarity and
   abundances were tested using multivariate analyses, Sorensen's index of
   similarity, vegetation cover and seedling counts.
   Results: The total diversity of vegetation and seed bank were 60 and 54
   vascular plant taxa, respectively, with 39 shared species, resulting in
   68\% similarity overall. Over 24 years, the heathland community
   progressed from open newly burned ground via species rich graminoid- and
   herb-dominated vegetation to mature Calluna heath. Post-fire Succession
   was not reflected in the seed bank. The 10 most abundant species
   constituted 98\% of the germinated seeds. The most abundant were Calluna
   vulgaris (49\%; 12018 seeds m(-2)) and Erica tetralix (34\%; 8414 seeds
   m(-2)). Calluna showed significantly higher germination the first 2
   years following fire.
   Conclusions: Vegetation species richness, ranging from 23 to 46 species
   yr(-1), showed a unimodal pattern over the post-fire succession. In
   contrast, the seed bank species richness, ranging from 21 to 31 species
   yr(-1) showed no trend. This suggests that the seed bank act as a
   refuge; providing a constant source of recruits for species that
   colonise newly burned areas. The traditional management regime has not
   depleted or destroyed the seed banks and continued management is needed
   to ensure sustainability of northern heathlands.}},

Title = {{Potential for post-fire recovery of Greater Sage-grouse habitat}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the western United States, fire has become a significant concern in
   the management of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) ecosystems.
   This is due to large-scale increases in cover of the fire-prone invasive
   annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and, concurrently, concerns about
   declining quantity and quality of habitat for Greater Sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus). The prevailing paradigm is that fire
   results in a loss of sage-grouse habitat on timescales relevant to
   conservation planning (i.e., 1-20 yr), since sagebrush cover can take
   many more years to recover post-fire. However, fire can have effects
   that improve sage-grouse habitat, including stimulating perennial grass
   and forb production. The conditions under which fire results in the
   permanent loss or enhancement of sage-grouse habitat are not well
   understood. We used long-term data from the Utah Division of Wildlife
   Resources Range Trend Project to assess short-term (1-4 yr
   post-treatment) and long-term (6-10 yr post-treatment) effects of fire
   on vegetation cover at 16 sites relative to sage-grouse habitat
   vegetation guidelines. Sagebrush cover remained low post-fire at sites
   considered historically unsuitable for sage-grouse (<10\% initial
   sagebrush cover). In contrast, at sites that had higher (>10\%) pre-fire
   sagebrush cover, sagebrush cover decreased to <10\% in the
   short-termpost-fire, but by 6-10 yr after fire, most of these sites
   exhibited a recovering trajectory and two sites had recovered to >10\%
   cover. Post-fire sagebrush cover was positively related to elevation.
   Across all sites, perennial grasses and forbs increased in cover to
   approximately meet the habitat vegetation guidelines for sage-grouse.
   Cheatgrass cover did not change in response to fire, and increased
   perennial grass cover appears to have played an important role in
   suppressing cheatgrass. Our results indicate that, while fire poses a
   potential risk for sage-grouse habitat loss and degradation, burned
   sites do not necessarily need to be considered permanently altered,
   especially if they are located at higher elevation, have high sagebrush
   cover pre-fire, and are reseededwith perennial grasses and forbs
   post-fire. However, our results confirm that fire at more degraded
   sites, for example, those with <10\% sagebrush cover, can result in
   cheat-grass-dominated landscapes and sagebrush loss at these sites
   should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the impacts of climate variability on low-elevation forests
   in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains by quantifying how post-fire tree
   regeneration and radial growth varied with growing-season climate. We
   reconstructed post-fire regeneration and radial growth rates of Pinus
   ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii at 33 sites that burned between 1992
   and 2007, by aging seedlings at the root-shoot boundary. We also
   measured radial growth in adult trees from 12 additional sites that
   burned between 1900 and 1990. To quantify the relationship between
   climate and regeneration, we characterized seasonal climate before,
   during, and after recruitment pulses using superposed epoch analysis. To
   quantify growth sensitivity to climate, we performed moving regression
   analysis for each species and for juvenile and adult life stages.
   Climatic conditions favoring regeneration and tree growth differed
   between species. Water deficit and temperature were significantly lower
   than average during recruitment pulses of ponderosa pine, suggesting
   that germination-year climate limits regeneration. Growing degree days
   were significantly higher than average during years with Douglas-fir
   recruitment pulses, but water deficit was significantly lower one year
   following pulses, suggesting moisture sensitivity in two-year-old
   seedlings. Growth was also sensitive to water deficit, but effects
   varied between life stages, species, and through time, with juvenile
   ponderosa pine growth more sensitive to climate than adult growth and
   juvenile Douglas-fir growth. Increasing water deficit corresponded with
   reduced adult growth of both species. Increases in maximum temperature
   and water deficit corresponded with increases in juvenile growth of both
   species in the early 20th century but strong reductions in growth for
   juvenile ponderosa pine in recent decades. Changing sensitivity of
   growth to climate suggests that increased temperature and water deficit
   may be pushing these species toward the edge of their climatic
   tolerances. Our study demonstrates increased vulnerability of dry
   mixed-conifer forests to post-fire regeneration failures and decreased
   growth as temperatures and drought increase. Shifts toward unfavorable
   conditions for regeneration and juvenile growth may alter the
   composition and resilience of low-elevation forests to future climate
   and fire activity.}},

   European Remote-Sensing (ERS) (C-band VV) images covering the time
   period from 1993 to 2007. The developed scheme mapped the post-fire
   land-cover types accurately: 0.84 Kappa coefficient and 90.5\% overall
   accuracy. The use of the ERS backscatter coefficient contributed to
   decreasing the commission errors related to the mapping of forested
   areas and to overcoming misclassifications that occurred between
   forested areas and shrublands located in shadowed areas. Results
   indicated that the forest regeneration rate is rather slow, especially
   in areas where the degree of burn severity was high while the largest
   part of the burned area is, to date, covered by low vegetation and
   shrubs. Nevertheless, a gradual shift from low vegetation to shrubland
   was observed. A preliminary investigation on the use of the ERS
   backscatter coefficient and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index
   to monitor forest regeneration revealed that the backscatter coefficient
   could provide information related to changes in dense regenerating pine
   forests for the first 18 years after the fire event, whereas the
   Normalised Difference Vegetation Index was found to be sensitive to the
   regenerating forest understorey vegetation. However, further
   investigation is needed to confirm these findings.}},

Abstract = {{The typical Mediterranean phrygana has a very rich biodiversity of
   plants and of solitary bees. Fire may kill the brood of soil-nesting and
   other solitary bees and may affect pollen and nectar sources. Such
   changes would be expected to influence seed production in populations of
   post-fire obligate seeder species and thus also their population
   dynamics. We compared nectar standing crop, flower visitation rate of
   bumble bees and solitary bees, and consequent seed production in a
   typical Mediterranean shrub (Salvia fruticosa Miller) growing in
   unburned east Mediterranean phrygana vegetation and in an adjacent
   burned area. The volume of nectar standing crop in the burned area was
   higher than in the unburned area, while the nectar concentration showed
   the opposite trend. The mean frequency of Bombus' visits was higher in
   the burned area, while solitary bees visited flowers only in the
   unburned habitats. The seed production of S. fruticosa was significantly
   lower in the burned area. This reduction might have a long-term effect
   on post-fire species composition and abundance due to the fact that this
   species is an obligate post-fire seeder. The present evidence indicates
   that the bee-dependent pollination environment was not re-balanced even
   six years after fire. This situation has important implications
   concerning plant species and their bee pollinator diversity.}},

Abstract = {{To test the assumption that forest harvesting can maintain wildlife
   through emulating natural disturbance, we compared small mammal
   abundance between seven post-fire and nine clearcut plots representing
   three ages since disturbance (4, 14 and 27 years). On each site, two
   Victor snap traps were placed at 100 stations on 10 x 10 grids spaced 20
   m apart. Clethrionomys gapperi were more abundant in clearcut plots,
   likely due to abundant coarse woody debris. This difference decreased
   through time. No other species differed between disturbance types. In
   both burned and clearcut plots, the abundance of C. gapperi was lowest
   on 14-year-old sites while Microtus pennsylvaticus and Sorex cinereus
   peaked at 14 years. At the meso-scale (plot-level), grass, herbs, and
   coarse woody debris explained 53\% of the variation in small mammal
   abundance. At the micro-scale (individual trapsite), several variables
   showed statistical significance, yet only 13\% of the variation in small
   mammals was explained. This was reduced to 4\% when the spatial
   component of ecological variation was controlled. This suggests that our
   small mammals are coarse-grained foragers and fine-scale vegetation
   descriptions have little ability to explain small mammal abundance. We
   conclude that the coarse-filter approach to forest management by

Abstract = {{Establishing the time since fire in infrequently burnt, yet fire-prone,
   communities is a significant challenge. Until this can be resolved for
   >50-year timeframes, our capacity to understand important ecological
   processes, such as the periods required for development of habitat
   features, will remain limited. We characterised the relationship between
   observable tree growth rings, plant age and plant size in Eucalyptus
   salubris F.Muell. in the globally significant Great Western Woodlands in
   south-western Australia. In the context of recent concerns regarding
   high woodland fire occurrence, we then used this approach to estimate
   the age of long-unburnt E. salubris stands, and the age-class
   distribution of Eucalyptus woodlands across the region. Time since fire
   was strongly predicted by trunk growth rings and plant size predicted
   growth rings with reasonable accuracy. The best model estimating growth
   rings contained parameters for trunk diameter, plant height and plot
   location, although simple models including either trunk diameter or
   plant height were nearly as good. Using growth ring-size relationships
   to date long-unburnt stands represents a significant advance over the
   current approach based on satellite imagery, which substantially
   truncates post-fire age. However, there was significant uncertainty over
   the best model form for estimating the time since fire of stands last
   burnt over 200 years ago. The management implications of predicted
   age-class distributions were highly dependent on both the choice of
   what, if any, transformation was applied to growth rings, and the
   theoretical age-class distribution to which the actual age-class
   distribution was compared.}},

Abstract = {{We measured plant and soil carbon (C) storage following canopy-replacing
   wildfires in woodlands of northeastern Spain that include an understory
   of shrubs dominated by Quercus coccifera and an overstory of Pinus
   halepensis trees. Established plant succession models predict rapid
   shrub recovery in these ecosystems, and we build on this model by
   contrasting shrub succession with long-term C storage in soils, trees,
   and the whole ecosystem. We used chronosequence and repeated sampling
   approaches to detect change over time. Aboveground plant C increased
   from < 100 to similar to 3,000 g C m(-2) over 30 years following fire,
   which is substantially less than the 5,942 +/- A 487 g C m(-2) (mean +/-
   1 standard error) in unburned sites. As expected, shrubs accumulated C
   rapidly, but the capacity for C storage in shrubs was < 600 g C m(-2).
   Pines were the largest plant C pool in sites > 20 years post fire, and
   accounted for all of the difference in plant C between older burned
   sites and unburned sites. In contrast, soil C was initially higher in
   burned sites (similar to 4,500 g C m(-2)) than in unburned sites (3,264
   +/- A 261 g C m(-2)) but burned site C declined to unburned levels
   within 10 years after fire. Combining these results with prior research
   suggests two states for C storage. When pine regeneration is successful,
   similar to 9,200 g C m(-2) accumulate in woodlands but when tree
   regeneration fails (due to microclimatic stress or short fire return
   intervals), ecosystem C storage of similar to 4,000 g C m(-2) will occur
   in the resulting shrublands.}},

Abstract = {{Fuel hazard is often assumed to increase with fuel age, or the

   forests and woodlands in south-eastern Australia at 81 sites where

   maintain forest understorey in an early successional `shrubby' state,

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{437-445}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Unburnt patches within burnt landscapes are expected to provide an
   important resource for fauna, potentially acting as a refuge from direct
   effects of fire and allowing animals to persist in burnt landscapes.
   Nevertheless, there is little information about the way refugia are used
   by fauna and how populations may be affected by them. Planned burns are
   often patchy, with unburnt areas generally associated with gully systems
   providing a good opportunity to study faunal use of refugia. We used a
   before-after control-impact design associated with a planned burn in
   south eastern Australia to investigate how two small mammal species, the
   bush rat Rattus fuscipes and agile antechinus Antechinus agilis, used
   unburnt gully systems within a larger burnt area. We tested three
   alternative hypotheses relating to post-fire abundance: (i) active
   refugia - abundance would increase in unburnt patches because of a
   post-fire shift of individuals from burnt to unburnt areas; (ii) passive
   refugia - abundance in unburnt patches would remain similar to pre-fire
   levels; and (iii) limited or no refugia - abundance would reduce in
   unburnt patches related to the change induced by fire in the wider
   landscape. We found the two species responded differently to the
   presence of unburnt refugia in the landscape. Relative to controls, fire
   had little effect on bush rat abundance in gullies, supporting
   hypothesis 2. In contrast, agile antechinus abundance increased in
   gullies immediately post-fire consistent with a shift of individuals
   from burnt parts of the landscape, supporting hypothesis 1. Differences
   in site fidelity, habitat use and intraspecific competition between
   these species are suggested as likely factors influencing responses to
   refugia. The way unburnt patches function as faunal refugia and the
   subsequent influence they have on post-fire population dynamics, will to
   some extent depend on the life history attributes of individual species.}},

Abstract = {{The unique ecosystems of the Abraus peninsula on the Caucasian Black Sea
   coast persisted in the Utrish State Nature Reserve (Russia), are
   represented by dry Eastern Mediterranean subtropics with a large number
   of endemics and relics that have been persisted from the Tertiary
   period. This is one of the few places in Russia where juniper pistachio
   (Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus excelsa, J. foetidissima, J. oxycedrus)
   woodlands grow. In 2016-2018, a study was conducted on the content of
   the biological properties of brown soils in two areas of the Abraus
   peninsula. The main focus is on the monitoring of Vodopadnaya shchel' on
   the Utrish State Nature Reserve monitoring site, located in the
   post-fire area of juniper woodland (Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus
   excelsa, J. foetidissima, J. oxycedrus) at an altitude of 110-140 m
   a.s.l. on the southern spurs of the Ridge Navagir. The fire happened in
   2009. Additionally, in April 2018, the site of the burnt area of 2013
   was investigated in the immediate vicinity of the Sukhaya shchel' of the
   Utrish State Nature Reserve. The area of the burnt site was several
   hectares including violation of terrestrial vegetation and changes in
   the ecological state of the soil. We have demonstrated that brown soils
   are rare for Russia (Cromic Cambisol and Cromi-Leptic Luvisol according
   to the WRB international classification). But these are widespread in
   most parts of the Abraus peninsula, including the Utrish State Nature
   Reserve. The main features of brown soils include the brown colour of
   the soil profile; intense textural lining of the middle part of the soil
   profile; eluvial-illuvial type of decarbonisation closed to neutral
   reaction of the environment; soil richness with elements of mineral
   nutrition. The studied soils in the Utrish State Nature Reserve are
   characterised by higher stoniness and rubble, no carbonate growths,
   fragmentation of the forest floor due to the low-mountain dissected
   relief of the territory. We have studied the ecological and biological
   properties of these soils in response to fire (e.g. temperature,
   moisture, soil bulk density, organic carbon and carbonate content,
   bacteria abundance, catalase, peroxidase, dehydrogenase, and invertase
   activities). In the grass-shrub stage, the restorative succession was in
   both burnt areas. The fire had a significant effect on the ecological
   and biological properties of brown soils 5-9 years after the fire
   impact. Many of the biological properties of post-fire soils differed
   significantly in comparison with the properties of control areas of
   juniper light forest. The organic carbon content and biological activity
   of post-fire soils as a whole are reduced as compared with the soils of
   control areas of juniper light forest. In this case, a high variation of
   the biological parameters of the soil was noted in different parts of
   the same burnt area. The variation is associated both with the
   peculiarities of the mountain relief, and with the nature of the
   vegetation, which forms refugia different in the number of plant
   residues. The rate of carbon dioxide production in the surface horizons
   of the burnt area soil is more than 2 times lower than the values in
   control areas. Five years after the fire, the post-fire soil of the
   Sukhaya shchel' area contained almost half of the humus content at the 5
   cm surface layer compared to the soil of the control area of juniper
   woodlands. At a depth of 15-25 cm, the difference between the soils
   areas remained at the same level as for the upper horizons.
   Thus, we demonstrated a significant effect of fires on the biological
   parameters of the subtropical soils in the Utrish State Nature Reserve,
   which has been persisted for many years.}},

   measured through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
   obtained from Landsat images. The relationship between fire severity and
   regeneration dynamics showed consistent results. Short-term regeneration
   was slowed down when severity was higher. The models generated by GWR

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Short-term post-fire field studies have shown that native
   shrub cover in chaparral ecosystems negatively affects introduced cover,
   which is influenced by burn severity, elevation, aspect, and climate.
   Using the southern California 2003 Old and Simi fires and the 2008
   Sesnon Fire, we investigated the role of native shrubs in post-fire
   ecosystem responses across gradients of elevation, aspect, climate, burn
   severities, fire histories, and time. We collected field estimates of
   species cover in 2004 and 2015 at nested sampling sites. We used
   structural equation models with introduced and shrub cover as dependent
   variables.
   Results: Shrub cover in 2004 was most influenced by the number of
   reburns, while shrub cover in 2015 was most influenced by the time
   between the two most recent fires. In 2004, introduced cover was most
   influenced by burn severity in 2003; similarly, in 2015, introduced
   cover was most influenced by burn severity in 2008. In both one and
   twelve years post fire, average precipitation increased the length of
   time between fires and decreased the number of times a site burned. This
   direct reduction in the number of times a site had burned due to average
   precipitation resulted in lower shrub cover one and twelve years post
   fire. Additionally, mean annual precipitation increased burn severity
   one year post fire, which resulted in lower introduced cover. However,
   this indirect relationship between precipitation and introduced cover
   through burn severity was no longer present twelve years post fire.
   Shrub cover increased with a longer average time between fires twelve
   years after fire. Shrub cover did not mediate any indirect relationships
   between burn severity or fire history metrics and introduced cover in
   either year, suggesting competitive exclusion of introduced species by
   shrubs.
   Conclusion: Our research found that significant fire effects on shrub
   and introduced species are often mediated by precipitation.
   Precipitation trends are likely to change fire regimes and thus alter
   plant community dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical moist forests are declining rapidly worldwide. Reforestation
   efforts in Trinidad have generally been insufficient and focused on
   non-native species. Some of these species (e.g. Pinus caribaea),
   however, appear ecologically inappropriate but have been used
   extensively on sandy soils after fires or where harvesting has degraded
   the original vegetation. Little research attention has been given to
   natural regeneration as a potential for future timber production. The
   purpose of this study was to determine whether or not post-fire
   regeneration provided sufficient species of commercial importance that
   could influence forest management planning. The field research was
   conducted at the Melajo Nature Reserve in north-east Trinidad, where
   there has been a particular focus on non-native species plantation in
   adjacent areas. A fire in 1987 devastated much of the remaining mature
   mora (Mora excelsa Benth.) forest at the Melajo Nature Reserve. The
   successional species were identified and recorded four years after the
   fire, and the abundances of commercially-important regenerating species
   were determined. The total number of species recorded was 201,
   representing 60 families with 153 genera. There were 14 species of
   timber value, with Mora excelsa, Terminalia amazonia, Byrsonima spicata
   and Sterculia caribaea being the most abundant. The abundance of
   commercially-important timber species in the most fire-damaged plot was
   93\% less than that for the least fire-damaged plot. The density of
   these species at the post-fire site in Melajo was on average higher than
   that of the same species in the mature mora forest. In 1991, the
   post-fire site at Melajo contained about 54\% of the species recorded
   for a mature mora forest at Matura, north of Melajo (over 50 years ago).}},

Abstract = {{The predominant fire regime associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests in the southwestern US has shifted from the historic
   norm of frequent, low-severity fires to less frequent mixed-severity and
   crown fires. This change in the severity of fire has altered ponderosa
   pine forests from the open stands typical of pre-settlement times to
   even-aged, high-density stands at increased risk of crown fire. As a
   result, restoration plans and post-fire management practices must
   consider the spatial and temporal variability of fire severity in both
   mixed-severity and crown fire events because fire-severity patterns
   strongly influence post-fire ecological conditions. This study examines
   the landscape pattern of fire severity in the Ponil Complex Fire and
   applies a moving-window approach to post-fire landscape pattern
   measurement. The moving-window approach allows examination of the
   quantitative and spatial variability of landscape pattern, producing a
   more nuanced description of forest pattern when compared to
   whole-landscape or patch-based metrics. The fire resulted in a complex
   mosaic of fire patches and forest-structure changes. In high-severity
   fire patches, mean and median values of many post-fire landscape metrics
   were markedly different from those in low and moderate-severity patches.
   Landscape pattern in high-severity patches also had the greatest
   variability of metric values, suggesting that high-severity fire patches
   require a spatially mediated management response to fire. Categorical
   fire-severity maps and traditional landscape-pattern assessment would
   not be able to identify these spatially variable post-fire conditions.

Abstract = {{QuestionWhat are the short-term (first 4yrs) dynamics of a Mediterranean
   heathland following burning during the early- vs the late-fire season?
   LocationSerra da LousA, Central Portugal.
   MethodsThe vegetation studied was a 16-year old heathland with Erica
   australis (resprouter), Pterospartum tridentatum (resprouter/seeder) and
   Erica umbellata (seeder) among the dominant species. Four blocks, each
   with three 50mx 40m plots, were established. One plot per block was
   burned during the early season (ES) and one during the late season (LS),
   and the third remained unburned. Prior to, and during the first 4yrs
   after burning, each burned plot was sampled for species abundance,
   vigour and richness. The effects of fire through time were tested using
   random blocks repeated measures ANOVA. Recruitment was modelled as a
   function of percentage of post-fire soil covered by litter (\%). MANOVA
   was used to test changes in the relative dominance of the woody species
   due to fire. Community dynamics were assessed by NMDS ordination
   analysis.
   ResultsFire severity was higher and the percentage of post-fire soil
   covered by litter lower in ES than LS burns. The post-fire plant
   dynamics were dominated by the resprouting response. Resprouting was not
   affected by burning season, but ES fires resulted in higher seedling
   recruitment than LS fires, particularly in the dominant seeder
   E.umbellata. Seedling recruitment was negatively related to post-fire
   soil covered by litter. Additionally, seedling emergence was delayed by
   nearly 1yr in LS fires with respect to ES fires. Species richness was
   higher in ES than LS fires. Fire did not globally affect the relative
   abundance of the dominant species, although the seeder E.umbellata
   decreased its relative cover with respect to the other dominant species.
   Ordination analysis showed that the post-fire dynamics of the vegetation
   were on a track of convergence with the community existing before fire.
   ConclusionBurning season differentially affected regeneration, mainly by
   its effect on seeding, with little effect on resprouting. Burning season
   and associated changes in fire severity and soil covered by litter could
   alter the short-term regeneration dynamics, which can have important
   implications for managing this highly flammable vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Although mixed-severity fires are among the most widespread disturbances
   influencing western North American forests, they remain the least
   understood. A major question is the degree to which mixed-severity fire
   regimes are simply an ecological intermediate between low-and
   high-severity fire regimes, versus a unique disturbance regime with
   distinct properties. The Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern
   Oregon and northwestern California provide an excellent laboratory for
   studies of mixed-severity fire effects, as structurally diverse
   vegetation types in the region foster, and partly arise from, fires of
   variable severity. In addition, many mixed-severity fires have occurred
   in the region in the last several decades, including the nationally
   significant 200,000-ha Biscuit Fire. Since 2002, we have engaged in
   studies of early ecosystem response to 15 of these fires, ranging from
   determinants of fire effects to responses of vegetation, wildlife, and
   biogeochemistry. We present here some of our important early findings
   regarding mixed-severity fire, thereby updating the state of the science
   on mixed-severity fire regimes and highlighting questions and hypotheses
   to be tested in future studies on mixed-severity fire regimes. Our
   studies in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion suggest that forests with
   mixed-severity fire regimes are characterized primarily by their
   intimately mixed patches of vegetation of varied age, resulting from
   complex variations in both fire frequency and severity and species
   responses to this variation. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that
   the proximity of living and dead forest after mixed-severity fire, and
   the close mingling of early-and late-seral communities, results in
   unique vegetation and wildlife responses compared to predominantly
   low-or high-severity fires. These factors also appear to contribute to
   high resilience of plant and wildlife species to mixed-severity fire in
   the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion. More informed management of ecosystems
   with mixed-severity regimes requires understanding of their wide
   variability in space and time, and the particular ecological responses
   that this variability elicits.}},

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal and seedling establishment are essential for plant
   recolonization after disturbances, especially for plants that rely
   exclusively on sexual reproduction such as post-fire colonizer trees.
   Fire refugia may play a key role not only allowing trees to survive
   fire, but also functioning as seed sources after it. The estimation of
   seed dispersal and seedling establishment are essential for assessing
   plant recolonization ability, understanding landscape dynamics and
   determining which areas may not be able to recover due to lack of seed
   arrival. Here we study the post-fire recolonization ability of
   Austrocedrus chilensis (Cordilleran Cypress) from fire refugia in burned
   areas of northwest Patagonia, Argentina. We mapped all female trees,
   saplings and seedlings within and around fire refugia, recorded the
   reproductive capacity of female trees and characterized the microsite
   conditions for establishment. We used an inverse modelling approach and
   Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the seed dispersal kernel
   and the probability of seedling establishment. We found that the average
   dispersal distance of an A. chilensis seed was 88.52 m. The dispersal
   kernel was fat-tailed, meaning that A. chilensis has the capacity of
   producing accelerating expansions. Large woody debris, litter, and the
   protection of shrubs were the most important factors associated with the
   presence of recruits. We highlight the importance of fire refugia as
   seed sources for the recolonization of burned areas and thus the
   relevance of protecting these places to allow the persistence of
   fire-sensitive species.}},

Abstract = {{Cork oak (Quercus suber) forests are acknowledged for their biodiversity
   and economic (mainly cork production) values. Wildfires are one of the
   main threats contributing to cork oak decline in the Mediterranean
   Basin, and one major question that managers face after fire in cork oak
   stands is whether the burned trees should be coppiced or not. This
   decision can be based on the degree of expected crown regeneration
   assessed immediately after fire. In this study we carried out a
   post-fire assessment of the degree of crown recovery in 858 trees being
   exploited for cork production in southern Portugal, 1.5 years after a
   wildfire. Using logistic regression, we modelled good or poor crown
   recovery probability as a function of tree and stand variables. The main
   variables influencing the likelihood of good or poor crown regeneration
   were bark thickness, charring height, aspect and tree diameter. We also
   developed management models, including simpler but easier to measure
   variables, which had a lower predictive power but can be used to help
   managers to identify, immediately after fire, trees that will likely
   show good crown regeneration, and trees that will likely die or show
   poor regeneration (and thus, potential candidates for trunk coppicing).}},

Title = {{Temporal Decorrelation of C-Band Backscatter Coefficient in
   Mediterranean Burned Areas}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Burned area algorithms from radar images are often based on temporal
   differences between pre- and post-fire backscatter values. However, such
   differences may occur long past the fire event, an effect known as
   temporal decorrelation. Improvements in radar-based burned areas
   monitoring depend on a better understanding of the temporal
   decorrelation effects as well as its sources. This paper analyses the
   temporal decorrelation of the Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficient
   over burned areas in Mediterranean ecosystems. Several environmental
   variables influenced the radar scattering such as fire severity,
   post-fire vegetation recovery, water content, soil moisture, and local
   slope and aspect were analyzed. The ensemble learning method random
   forests was employed to estimate the importance of these variables to
   the decorrelation process by land cover classes. Temporal decorrelation
   was observed for over 32\% of the burned pixels located within the study
   area. Fire severity, vegetation water content, and soil moisture were
   the main drivers behind temporal decorrelation processes and are of the
   utmost importance for areas detected as burned immediately after fire
   events. When burned areas were detected long after fire (decorrelated
   areas), due to reduced backscatter coefficient variations between pre-
   to post-fire acquisitions, water content (soil and vegetation) was the
   main driver behind the backscatter coefficient changes. Therefore, for
   efficient synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based monitoring of burned
   areas, detection, and mapping algorithms need to account for the
   interaction between fire impact and soil and vegetation water content.}},

Abstract = {{Questions How did post-wildfire understorey plant community response,
   including exotic species response, differ between pre-fire treated areas
   that were less severely burned, and pre-fire untreated areas that were
   more severely burned? Were these differences consistent through time?
   Location East-central Arizona, southwestern US. Methods We used a
   multi-year data set from the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire to detect
   post-fire trends in plant community response in burned ponderosa pine
   forests. Within the burn perimeter, we examined the effects of pre-fire
   fuels treatments on post-fire vegetation by comparing paired treated and
   untreated sites on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. We sampled
   these paired sites in 2004, 2005 and 2011. Results There were
   significant differences in pre-fire treated and untreated plant
   communities by species composition and abundance in 2004 and 2005, but
   these communities were beginning to converge in 2011. Total understorey
   plant cover was significantly higher in untreated areas for all 3yr.
   Plant cover generally increased between 2004 and 2005 and markedly
   decreased in 2011, with the exception of shrub cover, which steadily
   increased through time. The sharp decrease in forb and graminoid cover
   in 2011 is likely related to drought conditions since the fire.
   Annual/biennial forb and graminoid cover decreased relative to perennial
   cover through time, consistent with the initial floristics hypothesis.
   Exotic plant response was highly variable and not limited to the
   immediate post-fire, annual/biennial community. Despite low overall
   exotic forb and graminoid cover for all years (<2.5\%), several exotic
   species increased in frequency, and the relative proportion of exotic to
   native cover increased through time. Conclusions Pre-treatment fuel
   reduction treatments helped maintain foundation overstorey species and
   associated native plant communities following this large wildfire. The
   overall low cover of exotic species on these sites supports other
   findings that the disturbance associated with high-severity fire does
   not always result in exotic species invasions. The increase in relative
   cover and frequency though time indicates that some species are
   proliferating, and continued monitoring is recommended. Patterns of
   exotic species invasions after severe burning are not easily predicted,
   and are likely more dependent on site-specific factors such as
   propagules, weather patterns and management.}},

Abstract = {{Besides direct damage, wildfires can produce striking direct and
   indirect impacts, including extreme runoff-erosion responses with
   serious negative consequences for land-use sustainability and downstream
   values at risk. The best way to reduce post-fire runoff is the rapid
   application of mulch: a protective cover of straw, needles, wood-based
   material, or other ground cover. In this study, we assessed the efficacy
   of forest residue mulching for reducing post-fire runoff across spatial
   scales on a logged and burnt eucalypt hillslope. Additionally, we
   assessed the underlying processes involved in the hydrologic responses
   of burnt areas in central Portugal during the first 2 years after a
   wildfire, with special focus on soil moisture, soil water repellency,
   and rainfall. Forest residue mulch reduced post-fire runoff by 50\% in
   both micro-plots (0.25 m(2)) and hillslope scale silt fence plots (100
   m(2)) during the first year after the wildfire. Runoff in the
   micro-plots was tenfold higher than the larger plots, regardless of
   mulching. The main controlling factors for the volume of runoff were
   rainfall amount (direct correlation) and soil moisture (inverse
   correlation). Soil water repellency and soil moisture were not affected
   by the mulch but played a role in the hydrologic response. In contrast,
   there was no decrease in runoff rate within the first two post-fire
   years. Forest residue mulching can be an effective postfire treatment
   for reducing runoff rates, and the consistent decrease in runoff rates
   between the two spatial scales suggests that the scaling of runoff was
   not affected by the mulch. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil conservation is a major concern for catchments affected by forest

   repellency increase the risk of topsoil erosion. This paper evaluates
   two soil conditioners (a wetting agent and a polyvinyl acetate) for

   effects of these treatments on run-off, water retention, erosion and

   Polyvinyl acetate had little impact on water retention but was effective
   in reducing soil loss. The surfactant had little impact on water run-off
   or soil loss but substantially improved water retention and plant
   biomass production. Application of soil conditioners on post-fire areas
   could be a valuable technique in a soil conservation strategy. To
   maximize their benefits, soil conditioners could be applied with seeding

Abstract = {{Questions Gradients of fire severity in dry conifer forests can be
   associated with variation in understory floristic composition. Recent
   work in dry conifer forests in California, USA, has suggested that more
   severely burned stands contain more thermophilic taxa (those associated
   with warmer and drier conditions), and that forest disturbance may
   therefore accelerate floristic shifts already underway due to climate
   change. However, it remains unknown how rapidly thermophilic taxa shifts
   occur following disturbance, how long such shifts are likely to persist,
   and how different thermophilic post-disturbance communities are from
   pre-disturbance communities. Location Colorado Front Range, USA. Methods
   We investigated these questions using a unique 15-year vegetation plot
   dataset that captures pre- and post-fire understory community
   composition across a gradient of fire severity in dry conifer forests,
   classifying taxa using the biogeographic affinity concept. Results
   Thermophilization (defined here as a decrease in the ratio of cool-mesic
   taxa to warm-xeric taxa, based on biogeographic affinity of
   paleobotanical lineages) was observed as early as one year post-fire for
   all fire severity classes, but was stronger at sites that burned at
   higher severity. The ratio of cool-mesic to warm-xeric taxa recovered to
   pre-fire levels within 10 years in stands that burned at low severity,
   but not in stands that burned at moderate or high severity. The process
   of thermophilization after high-severity fire appears to be driven
   primarily by the gain of warm-xeric taxa that were absent before the
   fire, but losses of cool-mesic taxa, which did not return during the
   duration of the study, also played a role. Conclusions Decreases in
   canopy cover appear to be a main contributor to understory
   thermophilization. Fine-scale heterogeneity in post-fire forest
   structure is likely an important driver of floristic diversity, creating

Abstract = {{Fire, which is the dominant disturbance in the boreal forest, creates
   substantial heterogeneity in soil burn severity at patch and landscape
   scales. We present results from five field experiments in Yukon
   Territory, Canada, and Alaska, USA that document the effects of soil
   burn severity on the germination and establishment of four common boreal
   trees: Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Pinus contorta subsp. latifolia, and
   Populus tremuloides. Burn severity had strong positive effects on seed
   germination and net seedling establishment after 3 years. Growth of
   transplanted seedlings was also significantly higher on severely burned
   soils. Our data and a synthesis of the literature indicated a
   consistent, steep decline in conifer establishment on organic soils at
   depths greater than 2.5 cm. A meta-analysis of seedling responses found
   no difference in the magnitude of severity effects on germination versus
   net establishment. There were, however, significant differences in
   establishment but not germination responses among deciduous trees,
   spruce, and pine, suggesting that small-seeded species experience
   greater mortality on lightly burned, organic soils than large-seeded
   species. Together, our analyses indicate that variations in burn
   severity can influence multiple aspects of forest stand structure, by
   affecting the density and composition of tree seedlings that establish
   after fire. These effects are predicted to be most important in
   moderately-drained forest stands, where a high potential variability in
   soil burn severity is coupled with strong severity effects on tree
   recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{P> Many restoration projects aim to transform degraded vegetation into
   mature native plant communities. The recovery of the structure and
   properties of reference native plant communities is acknowledged as a
   landmark of restoration, and the success of restoration practices is
   measured in terms of community metrics. Nurse-assisted planting has been
   proposed as a promising technique for the restoration of Mediterranean
   and arid vegetation based on its success at seedling establishment
   rather than on the recovery of reference community properties. We
   investigate the adequacy of this restoration practice by shifting the
   focus of restoration from the species to the community level.
   In contrast to previous studies in the Mediterranean region, we assessed
   the efficacy of several management techniques, including nurse-based
   planting, in the recovery of the structure and properties of mature
   native reference communities. In a burned area of southern Spain, we
   applied widely used community analysis tools (rarefaction and species
   accumulation curves, Chao 2 richness estimator, species evenness and
   beta diversity) to compare the profiles of a reference native community
   and the community achieved through different management practices:
   traditional planting, nurse-based planting and controls where natural
   regeneration was allowed to occur.
   Our results showed that post-fire establishment of planted seedlings was
   higher under the canopy of nurses than in open ground. More importantly,
   nurse-based restoration increased the species richness and evenness of
   tall-shrubs and trees as well as the life-form diversity, with the
   restored community approaching the reference community in terms of both
   composition and structure of the bank of juveniles.
   Synthesis and applications. We conclude that in contrast to traditional
   reforestation, where diversity is constrained by the elimination of
   pioneer and regenerated tall-shrubs, nurse-based restoration contributes
   to accelerated recovery of important community structure and properties.
   Thus, it should be used preferentially over traditional reforestation in
   Mediterranean mountains where restoration of native communities, and not
   merely tree establishment, is dictated under current habitat directives.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of wildfire and
   subsequent forest management on the diversity and functional community
   structure of fungi during early stage of succession in the coastal sand
   dunes of the Curonian Spit in Lithuania. 12 permanent study plots were
   established in multiple forest areas: burnt, not managed (B); burnt,
   clear-cut (C); burnt, clear-cut and reforested (R) and unburnt (U).
   During three years of the study, a total of 390 different fungal species
   were determined. The overall number of recorded species in studied
   post-fire variants comprised 52\% (B), 41\% (C) and 48\% (R) of unburnt
   sites (U, 261 species). Significantly different species compositions
   were registered between C and B plots, while no difference was observed
   between C and R plots. Fungal communities of all burnt sites showed more
   significant differences stemming from annual changes rather than from
   types of forest management. Early succession of the post-fire fungal
   communities maintained the fungi from all defined taxonomical and
   functional groups. However, a certain alteration within some fungal life
   styles was observed. The wildfire has negatively impacted the lichens
   and the mycorrhizal species, as the percentages of these groups
   decreased from 15\% and 12\% in U plots to 10\% and 3\% in B plots. Wood
   saprobic fungi and soil saprobes were affected negatively by harvesting
   of the burnt trees that reduced their percentage from 38\% and 8\% in B
   plots to 27\% and 4\% in C plots. Soil-associated fungi were less
   affected both by fire and post-fire management than the fungi inhabiting
   above-ground substrates. The percentage of soil-associated fungi
   initially increased in the burnt sites, but two years after the fire it
   returned to the pre-fire level. No significant effect on soil-inhabiting
   fungi was noted for the differently managed post-fire sites. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Exotic tree species are increasingly common in many regions of the world
   and at least some species are becoming naturalized in the regions where
   they were introduced. Disturbances like fire may be at the origin or
   accelerate the naturalization of these species. Portugal holds one of
   the largest areas of exotic Eucalyptus globulus plantations in the world
   and is one of the countries most affected by forest fires. These two
   facts have triggered the present research. This study aimed at
   characterising medium-term natural establishment of E. globulus plants
   originated from seeds under natural conditions in burnt planted forests
   (pure E. globulus stands, pure Pinus pinaster stands, and mixed stands
   of both species), and at analysing factors associated with this
   establishment. Occurrence, abundance and height of naturally established
   E. globulus plants were characterized in 284 sites distributed in burnt
   areas, across Central and Northern Portugal, 57 years after wildfire.
   Generalized linear models were used to assess the influence of stand
   type, regional productivity potential, and post-fire management
   practices on occurrence probability, density, and median height of
   sampled E. globulus individuals. The influence of these explanatory
   variables on the structure (in terms of size class distribution) of
   naturally established E. globulus cohort was examined using analysis of
   similarity and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Naturally
   established E. globulus plants were present in 93.1\%, 19.0\% and 98.6\%
   of samples in pure E. globulus, pure P. pinaster and mixed stands,
   respectively. Cohort median density was 0.20 plants m(-2) and maximum
   density was 4.55 plants m(-2). Median height of plants was 2.0 m and
   95.3\% of them had h >1.30 m and <= 5 cm. Establishment probability,
   density and median height were highest in the most productive regions.
   Three post-fire management operations had a significant influence on the
   response variables: (i) salvage logging was associated with a higher
   density; (ii) tillage was associated with a lower density and a smaller
   median height; (iii) understorey removal was associated with a lower
   occurrence probability. Tillage was the only studied factor influencing
   the size structure of spontaneously established cohort, eliminating
   larger plants. This study showed that stand type, productivity region
   and post-fire management operations might have significantly influenced
   the natural establishment of E. globulus in burnt areas, and
   consequently the species naturalization process in Portugal. The
   implications of these findings for management are discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Management guidelines for many fire-prone ecosystems highlight the
   importance of maintaining a variable mosaic of fire histories for
   biodiversity conservation. Managers are encouraged to aim for fire
   mosaics that are temporally and spatially dynamic, include all
   successional states of vegetation, and also include variation in the
   underlying invisible mosaic of past fire frequencies, severities, and
   fire return intervals. However, establishing and maintaining variable
   mosaics in contemporary landscapes is subject to many challenges, one of
   which is deciding how the fire mosaic should be managed following the
   occurrence of large, unplanned wildfires. A key consideration for this
   decision is the extent to which the effects of previous fire history on
   vegetation and habitats persist after major wildfires, but this topic
   has rarely been investigated empirically. In this study, we tested to
   what extent a large wildfire interacted with previous fire history to
   affect the structure of forest, woodland, and heath vegetation in
   Booderee National Park in southeastern Australia. In 2003, a summer
   wildfire burned 49.5\% of the park, increasing the extent of recently
   burned vegetation (<10 yr post-fire) to more than 72\% of the park area.
   We tracked the recovery of vegetation structure for nine years following
   the wildfire and found that the strength and persistence of fire effects
   differed substantially between vegetation types. Vegetation structure
   was modified by wildfire in forest, woodland, and heath vegetation, but
   among-site variability in vegetation structure was reduced only by
   severe fire in woodland vegetation. There also were persistent legacy
   effects of the previous fire regime on some attributes of vegetation
   structure including forest ground and understorey cover, and woodland
   midstorey and overstorey cover. For example, woodland midstorey cover
   was greater on sites with higher fire frequency, irrespective of the
   severity of the 2003 wildfire. Our results show that even after a large,
   severe wildfire, underlying fire histories can contribute substantially
   to variation in vegetation structure. This highlights the importance of
   ensuring that efforts to reinstate variation in vegetation fire age
   after large wildfires do not inadvertently reduce variation in
   vegetation structure generated by the underlying invisible mosaic.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleation is a successional process in which extant vegetation
   facilitates seed dispersal and recruitment of other individuals and
   species around focal points in the landscape, leading to ecosystem
   recovery. This is an important process in disturbed sites where
   regeneration is limited by abiotic conditions or restrictive seed
   dispersal. We investigated forest recovery in a large burned area of
   evergreen temperate rainforest in southern Chile subjected to seasonal
   soil waterlogging, and assessed the relevance of nucleation processes in
   overcoming biotic and physical barriers for tree species regeneration.
   We measured richness and abundance of woody species in relation to patch
   size, as well as abiotic factors such as light and soil moisture within
   and outside patches. We found higher tree regeneration in existing
   patches than in open areas. We recorded an increase of patch size over
   time, associated with the increase in number of individuals and tree
   species. Soils in open areas were waterlogged, especially in winter,
   while patches were not. Trees in patches also acted as perches,
   enhancing bird-mediated seed rain. Seeds of fleshy-fruited tree species
   arrived first at patches and seedlings were more frequent in smaller,
   younger patches, while the number of seedlings of trees with
   wind-dispersed seeds increased in larger, older patches. Our study shows
   that woody species seem incapable of recruiting in open and waterlogged
   soils and depend strongly on extant vegetation patches to establish. In
   this fire-disturbed evergreen temperate forest regeneration occurs via
   nucleation, where new individuals contribute to a centrifugal kind of

Abstract = {{The almost complete elimination of fire from forest management practises
   in Scandinavia has made post-fire succession rare and, consequently,
   generated conservation problems. The importance of fire in conjunction
   with slash-and-burn cultivation has been recognised as a management
   strategy. It is a potential tool for managing forest structure and
   regeneration processes in nature reserves. In this study we observed the
   first decade of vegetation succession after slash-burning. Prior to the
   study, most trees at the study site were felled and burned. The
   monitoring was carried out in three burned areas of different age and an
   unmanaged control forest. In addition to describing the responses of
   different plant species and plant functional groups to fire,
   multivariate methods were applied to illustrate community level changes.
   The results indicated succession processes at each hierarchy level in
   the recovering community. In general, the community switched from
   pioneer bryophyte mass abundances to graminoid dominance within ten
   years. Moreover, plant diversity seemed to have increased due to
   slash-burning. A total of 88 plant taxa (i.e. vascular plants,
   bryophytes and lichens) were observed in the sample plots during the
   study period, as compared with the 44 taxa observed in control plots. We
   concluded that slash-burning is an appropriate method for mimicking
   natural fires, at least from a botanical perspective, and may therefore
   be a forest renewal practise worth considering in special areas.}},

Abstract = {{Woody species encroachment into herbaceous and shrub-dominated
   vegetations is a concern in many rangeland ecosystems of the world.
   Arrival of woody species into affected rangelands leads to changes in
   the spatial structure of vegetation and alterations of biophysical
   processes. In the western USA, encroachment of pinyon (Pinus spp.) and
   juniper (Juniperus spp.) tree species into sagebrush steppes poses a
   threat to the proper ecohydrological functioning of these ecosystems.
   Prescribed fire has been proposed and used as one rangeland improvement
   practice to restore sagebrush steppe from pinyon-juniper encroachment.
   Short-term effects of burning on the ecohydrologic response of these
   systems have been well documented and often include a period of
   increased hydrologic and erosion vulnerability immediately after
   burning. Long-term ecohydrologic response of sagebrush steppe ecosystems
   to fire is poorly understood due to lack of cross-scale studies on
   treated sites. The aim of this study is to evaluate long-term
   vegetation, hydrologic, and erosion responses at two
   pinyon-juniperencroached sagebrush sites 9 years after prescribed fire
   was applied as a restoration treatment. Thirty-six rainfall simulation
   experiments on 6 m x 2 m plots were conducted for 45 min under two
   conditions: a dry run (70 mm h(-1); dry antecedent soils) and a wet run
   (111 mm h(-1); wet antecedent soils). Runoff and erosion responses were
   compared between burned and unburned plots. Overall, increases in
   herbaceous cover in the shrub-interspace areas (intercanopy area between
   trees) at both sites 9 years post-burn resulted in runoff- and
   erosion-reduction benefits, especially under the wet runs. While the
   initially more degraded site characterized by 80\% bare ground pre-burn,
   registered a higher overall increase (40\% increase) in canopy cover,
   greater post-fire reductions in runoff and erosion were observed at the
   less degraded site (57\% bare ground pre-burn). Runoff and erosion for
   the wet runs decreased respectively by 6.5-fold and 76-fold at the
   latter site on the burned plots relative to control plots, whereas these
   decreases were more muted at the more degraded site (2.5 and 3-fold
   respectively). Significant fragmentation of flow paths observed at the
   more-degraded site 9 years post-fire, suggests a decreased hydrologic
   connectivity as a mechanism of runoff and erosion reduction during
   post-fire recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Regeneration of non-fire-prone seeder species after large fires has been
   claimed to depend closely on the arrival of propagules from seed
   sources, such as isolated surviving trees present within the burned area
   ({''}green islands{''}) or those on the unburned edges. However, scarce
   information is available on how individual and environmental factors may
   condition post-fire survival and, particularly, seed production of these
   trees. In this study we analyse the survival rate and the ability to
   produce seeds in the early post-fire years in Pinus nigra Arnold, a
   non-fire-prone pine severely affected by large fires in the 1990s all
   round the Mediterranean Basin. Survival and seed production have been
   analysed during 5 years in respect to wee size.. crown damage, and tree
   location (i.e. location in edges or in islands). Survival increased with
   tree size (dbh > 20 cm) and decreased with crown damage. However, the
   response of trees with different fire damage varied with location, as
   less-affected trees showed Weber survival in islands. while more
   affected ones performed better in the perimeter of the burned area.
   Concerning seed production. the main factor determining cone production
   after fire was tree size. because large trees produced more cones. and
   more frequently than small ones. No differences were observed due to
   crown damage, but cone production varied considerably depending on tree
   location. Thus, small trees produced cones more frequently in islands
   than on edges. while both cone production and the proportion of years
   that each tree produced cones decreased with island size. These results
   highlight the possible importance of preserving large trees in relation
   to non-fire-prone species. Their higher survival and higher and regular
   seed production rates make them the main post-fire seed sources. On the
   other hand. the fact that trees located in small ``green islands{''}
   produce more cones and more frequently than those in edges or large
   islands, stresses the importance of actively protecting and conserving
   these small groups of surviving trees. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Salvage logging is the commonest post-fire emergency action, but has
   unclear ecological effects. In the Mediterranean Basin, drought periods
   and fire regimes are changing and forest management should be adapted.
   In summer 2009, a mid-high severity fire burned 968 ha of Aleppo pine
   (Pinus halepensis Mill.) forest in southeast Spain, which was submitted
   to salvage logging six months later. In spring 2010, plots were set in
   untreated and logged areas to monitor the recruitment and survival of
   the main tree species and three companion species: Stipa tenacissima L.
   (resprouter), Cistus clusii Dunal and Rosmarinus officinalis L.
   (obligate seeders). We evaluated responses to different scenarios in
   relation to intensification of summer droughts and forest management to
   obtain differences in water stress, growth, and gas exchange to cope
   with summer drought. Drought was induced by using rain-exclusion
   shelters and recorded ecophysiological characteristics were obtained
   with a portable gas exchange system. The main tree species recruitment
   was poor, but companion species showed a high survival ratio. Lower
   water stress was found for obligate seeder seedlings, which was higher
   in logged areas with induced drought. The initial post-fire stage was
   similar for the studied areas. However, after two drought periods (2010
   and 2011), significant differences were found in the morphological and
   ecophysiological responses. In the unmanaged area, the biggest size of
   individuals due to the most marked increases in height and coverage were
   observed mainly in resprouter S. tenacissima. In the area submitted to
   salvage logging, the growth ratios in plots with induced drought were
   lower, mainly for seeders. Greater productivity was related to higher
   transpiration, stomatal conductance, and net photosynthetic ratio, but
   lower water use efficiency was found in obligate seeders with no drought
   induction, and S. tenacissima obtained higher values in untreated areas.
   Our results confirm that both forest management and intensification of
   summer droughts influenced the resilience and productivity of the
   ecosystems in the short term. Adaptive forest management after fire can
   imply successful survival and recovery of plant communities in the mid
   to long term. This study provide a scientific basis to develop tools for
   the post-fire restoration of serotinous pine forests occurring in
   low-altitudinal areas of the Mediterranean Basin, prone to summer
   droughts and fire events.}},

Abstract = {{To cope with the post-fire challenges of decreased availability of food
   and shelter, brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartit), a small marsupial
   mammal, increase the use of energy-conserving torpor and reduce
   activity. However, it is not known how long it takes for animals to
   resume pre-fire torpor and activity patterns during the recovery of
   burnt habitat. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that antechinus will
   adjust torpor use and activity after a fire depending on vegetation
   recovery. We simultaneously quantified torpor and activity patterns for
   female antechinus from three adjacent areas: (i) the area of a
   management burn 1 year post-fire, (ii) an area that was burned 2 years
   prior, and (iii) a control area. In comparison to shortly after the
   management burn, antechinus in all three groups displayed less frequent
   and less pronounced torpor while being more active. We provide the first
   evidence that only 1 year post-fire antechinus resume pre-fire torpor
   and activity patterns, probably in response to the return of herbaceous
   ground cover and foraging opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Pre- and post-fire measurements were made for a low-intensity prescribed
   fire in a semiarid, shrub-woodland transition zone, and objectives were
   to: (i) determine changes in near-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-f
   measured with a tension infiltrometer), air permeability (k(a) measured
   with an air permeameter), and soil physical properties at shrub
   undercanopy and interspace microsites immediately before and after a
   fall burn and for a 13-mo period; and (ii) quantify the importance and
   effect of post-fire soil structure on hydraulic properties using pre-
   and post-fire measurements. At undercanopy microsites, structure
   deteriorated from a moderate to a weak subangular blocky structure after
   the fire that broke down to a structureless soil 10 mo later. At
   interspace microsites, post-fire soil structure deteriorated from a
   moderate-strong subangular blocky structure with hard dry consistency to
   a weak subangular blocky structure with soft dry consistency. After 10
   mo, the intercanopy maintained a weak-moderate soil structure that
   became structureless-weak after 13 mo. Immediately after the fire, at
   both microsites, there was incomplete organic combustion, a decrease in
   bulk density, and an increase in k(a); however, at undercanopy
   microsites, there was no significant change in K-f even though there was
   a slight to moderate hydrophobicity, whereas at interspace microsites
   where no water repellency existed, K-f increased. These changes may be a
   result of expansion of vaporized water through soil pores that broke up
   aggregates, deteriorating soil structure. Thus, mechanisms that
   contributed to changes immediately and after the first year post-fire
   were different for low-intensity burns than for higher intensity burns.}},

Abstract = {{Fire ecological research within the Cape Floristic Region is largely
   restricted to fynbos vegetation and, amongst fauna, birds. Nothing is
   known about post-fire responses of birds in subtropical thicket, which
   burns on much longer cycles than fynbos. Extensive fires in subtropical
   thicket along the southeastern Cape coast (in the Knysna area during
   June 2017) presented the opportunity to assess the response of these
   birds to fire. We predicted that (1) fire reduces bird species
   diversity, richness and abundance in thicket during the first two years
   post-fire; and (2) fire changes feeding guild composition and results in
   the loss of frugivorous birds. Bird surveys (point counts) were
   undertaken between 12- and 21-months post-fire in burnt (n =7) and
   unburnt (n = 7) thicket sites to determine bird community structure and
   abundance. A total of 66 bird species and 2404 individuals were recorded
   of which 52 species and 1176 individuals were recorded in burnt thicket
   and 60 species and 1228 individuals in unburnt thicket. Ten species
   occurred only in burnt thicket and 13 species only in unburnt thicket.
   There was a 21\% loss of bird species (mainly forest birds) after fire.
   The Sorenson similarity coefficient was 60\% for bird species
   composition between burnt and unburnt thicket. The most common feeding
   guilds in terms of richness and abundance in both burnt and unburnt
   thicket were insectivores and generalists. Frugivores were most abundant
   in unburnt thicket, whereas granivores were most abundant in burnt
   thicket. Changes in thicket bird community composition following the
   fire were minor and are likely to be short-lived as thicket shrubs
   re-sprout vigorously after fire resulting in rapid recovery of
   vegetation and thus bird habitat structure.}},

Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{1. In Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems, plant species persist and
   regenerate after fire by resprouting, by recruiting new individuals from
   a seed bank (post-fire seeding), or by both resprouting and post-fire
   seeding. Since species with resprouting ability are already able to
   persist in fire-prone ecosystems, we hypothesize that they have been
   subjected to lower evolutionary pressure to acquire traits allowing or
   enhancing post-fire recruitment. Consequently, we predict that the
   germination of non-resprouters is more likely to be increased or at
   least unaffected by heat than the germination of resprouters.
   2. To test this hypothesis we compiled published experiments carried out
   in Mediterranean Basin species where seeds were exposed to different
   heat treatments. We compared the probability of heat-tolerant
   germination (i.e. heated seeds had greater or equal germination than the
   control), the probability of heat-stimulated germination (i.e. heated
   seeds had greater germination than the control) and the stimulation
   magnitude (differences in proportion of germination of the heated seeds
   in relation to the untreated seeds, for heat-stimulated treatments)
   between resprouters and non-resprouters.
   3. Non-resprouters showed higher probability of heat-tolerance, higher
   probability of heat-stimulation and higher stimulation magnitude even
   when phylogenetic relatedness was considered. Differences between
   life-forms and post-fire seeding ability do not explain this pattern.
   4. Non-resprouters appear to have a greater capacity to both (i) persist
   after fire by means of recruiting (greater heat-tolerance) and (ii)
   increase their population after fire (greater heat-stimulated
   germination), than resprouters.
   5. Synthesis. Our results contribute to understanding the factors that
   condition the evolution of fire-persistence plant traits and support the
   hypothesis that resprouting and post-fire recruitment are negatively
   associated in Mediterranean Basin flora.}},

Abstract = {{How do tree species regenerate and which ecological conditions are
   required after forest fire in the Insubric region of the Alps? Are
   indigenous stand-forming tree species resistant over the invasion of
   alien plant species after such a disturbance? We addressed these
   questions in a case study in the Swiss canton of Ticino. In April 2006,
   a surface fire with severe intensity burnt a forest area of 55 ha on a
   south-facing slope (400-800 m.a.s.l.). The dominant trees in the
   investigated area were chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.), beech (Fagus
   sylvatica L) and deciduous oaks (Quercus spp.) mixed with tree species
   of intermediate height. Vegetation data were collected in May and August
   2009 by systematic sampling. Resprouting of the survived trees and
   generative regeneration were analysed by counting vegetative shoots from
   sprouting stools, of seedling age, height and damage rate, respectively.
   Different vegetation structures related to low or high fire intensity
   were clearly visible three years after the forest fire, creating various
   habitats for both new invaders and seedlings of the stand-forming trees.
   The dominant chestnut was the only tree species that regenerated
   effectively by sprouting from stools. Seedlings of the stand-forming
   trees grew in high abundance under shadow conditions close to their
   mother trees which provided the seed source. In contrast, pioneer trees
   invaded patches where full light was available. Under such conditions
   the two main woody alien plant species. Ailanthus altissima and Robinia
   pseudoacacia, grew in high abundance. Due to the different ecological
   requirements of indigenous and alien tree seedlings, not any interaction
   between the two groups was detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of fire, post-fire salvage logging, and revegetation on
   nutrient budgets were estimated for a site in the eastern Sierra Nevada
   Mountains that burned in a wildfire in 1981. Approximately two decades
   after the fire, the shrub (former fire) ecosystem contained less C and
   more N than the adjacent forest ecosystem. Reconstruction of pre-fire
   nutrient budgets suggested that most C was exported in biomass during
   salvage logging and will not be recovered until forest vegetation
   occupies the site again. Salvage logging may have resulted in
   longer-term C sequestration in wood products than would have occurred
   had the logs been left in the field to decay, however. Reconstructed
   budgets suggested that most N was lost via volatilization during the
   fire rather than in post-fire salvage logging (assuming that foliage and
   0 horizons were cornbusted). Comparisons of the pre-fire and present day
   N budgets also suggested that the lost N was rapidly replenished in 0
   horizons and mineral soils, probably due to N-fixation by snowbush
   (Ceanothus velutinus Dougl.), the dominant shrub on the former fire
   site. There were no significant differences in ecosystem P, K, or S
   contents and no consistent, significant differences in soil extractable
   P or S between the shrub and forested plots. Exchangeable K+, Ca2+, and
   Mg2+ were consistently and significantly greater in shrub than in
   adjacent forested soils, however, and the differences were much larger
   than could be accounted for by estimated ash inputs. In the case of Ca,
   even the combustion of all aboveground organic matter could not account
   for more than a fraction of the difference in exchangeable pools. We
   speculate that the apparent large increased in soil and ecosystem Ca
   content resulted from either the release of Ca from non-exchangeable
   forms in the soil or the rapid uptake and recycling of Ca by post-fire
   vegetation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsHigh moisture levels and low occurrences of wildfires have
   contributed during recent millennia to the accumulation of thick layers
   of organic soil and to a succession into open black spruce (Picea
   mariana)-Sphagnum-dominated forests in the Clay Belt boreal landscapes

   drought frequency with climate change could lead to a shift in forest
   structure and composition via increased fire disturbance. Here, we
   quantify the expected changes in fire behaviour, biomass burning and
   vegetation composition in the Clay Belt forest of North America that
   could arise under climate change over the next century.
   LocationA managed forest unit in the Clay Belt boreal forest of eastern
   North America.
   MethodsThe impact of a changing climate from 1971 to 2100 on fire regime
   characteristics (i.e. rate of spread, fuel consumption, fire intensity,
   type of fire and depth of burn) and vegetation dynamics (mortality and
   recruitment) was investigated using the Canadian Fire Effects Model
   (CanFIRE). Vegetation dynamics were governed by the fire danger and
   behaviour that affect tree mortality and post-fire recruitment of
   species, and by long-term successional pathways that are driven by
   post-fire recruitment and forest age. An ensemble of two climate models
   forced by three scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions was used to drive
   CanFIRE simulations.
   ResultsResults from multiple scenarios suggested that fire danger will
   increase significantly during the 21st century in the Clay Belt forest.
   The burn rate was projected to change from 4.2\% decade(-1) during
   1971-2000 to 18.6\% decade(-1) during 2071-2100. Stand mortality, fire
   intensity and areas affected by crown fires were also projected to
   increase. A shift in forest composition did not occur over the
   simulation period across most of our fire regime scenarios. Dominance of
   open black spruce-Sphagnum forests was projected to remain in future
   landscapes.
   ConclusionsMoist and cool conditions in these forests prevent high depth
   of burn and contribute to the ecological resistance of these forests to
   increasing fire danger.}},
