Title = {{Influence of Fire Mosaics, Habitat Characteristics and Cattle
   Disturbance on Mammals in Fire-Prone Savanna Landscapes of the Northern
   Kimberley}},

Abstract = {{Patch mosaic burning, in which fire is used to produce a mosaic of
   habitat patches representative of a range of fire histories
   ('pyrodiversity'), has been widely advocated to promote greater
   biodiversity. However, the details of desired fire mosaics for
   prescribed burning programs are often unspecified. Threatened small to
   medium-sized mammals (35 g to 5.5 kg) in the fire-prone tropical
   savannas of Australia appear to be particularly fire-sensitive.
   Consequently, a clear understanding of which properties of fire mosaics
   are most instrumental in influencing savanna mammal populations is
   critical. Here we use mammal capture data, remotely sensed fire
   information (i.e. time since last fire, fire frequency, frequency of
   late dry season fires, diversity of post-fire ages in 3 km radius, and
   spatial extent of recently burnt, intermediate and long unburnt habitat)
   and structural habitat attributes (including an index of cattle
   disturbance) to examine which characteristics of fire mosaics most
   influence mammals in the north-west Kimberley. We used general linear
   models to examine the relationship between fire mosaic and habitat
   attributes on total mammal abundance and richness, and the abundance of
   the most commonly detected species. Strong negative associations of
   mammal abundance and richness with frequency of late dry season fires,
   the spatial extent of recently burnt habitat (post-fire age <1 year
   within 3 km radius) and level of cattle disturbance were observed. Shrub
   cover was positively related to both mammal abundance and richness, and
   availability of rock crevices, ground vegetation cover and spatial
   extent of >= 4 years unburnt habitat were all positively associated with
   at least some of the mammal species modelled. We found little support
   for diversity of post-fire age classes in the models. Our results
   indicate that both a high frequency of intense late dry season fires and
   extensive, recently burnt vegetation are likely to be detrimental to
   mammals in the north Kimberley. A managed fire mosaic that reduces large
   scale and intense fires, including the retention of >= 4 years unburnt
   patches, will clearly benefit savanna mammals. We also highlighted the
   importance of fire mosaics that retain sufficient shelter for mammals.
   Along with fire, it is clear that grazing by introduced herbivores also
   needs to be reduced so that habitat quality is maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous systems of management for regulating extraction of non-timber
   forest products (NTFP) have not been well documented in arid zone
   grazing lands. Conservation projects have therefore lacked information
   on customary rights to trees, while they have enforced systems of tree
   resource management that often conflicted with the indigenous system.
   This study focused on the indigenous tree tenure system of the Turkana
   pastoralists called ekwar (plural ngik-warin). The indigenous tree
   management system in 15.4km(2) of the Turkwel River floodplain woodlands
   near Lodwar, Kenya was investigated. The study began in 1990 after
   impoundment of the Turkwel Gorge Dam. In 1990 and 1998, Turkana
   pastoralists were interviewed about the ekwar. In individual ngikwarin
   woody cover, wood volume and woody-plant density were measured, and wood
   extraction assessed in terms of stems and twigs removed by the
   pastoralists and the urban population of Lodwar. Intensity of charcoal
   burning was assessed in terms of the density of earthen kilns, and
   livestock impact in terms of browsing frequency on woody plants.
   Potential Acacia tortilis litter production was estimated and an ekwar
   quality index developed to describe woodland productivity conditions.
   Tree produce was shared with and leased to friends and relatives. Woody
   cover showed no significant changes, while woody-plant density and
   volume declined, over the 8-year period. The Turkana usually do not cut
   live trees, but use dead trees and dry tree-parts for making charcoal.
   Increased kiln density and increased extraction of tree-parts were
   considered to be indicative of increased pressure on the riverine
   woodlands. Livestock browsing did not seem to contribute to woodland
   degradation. However, decline in woody-plant density and volume might
   have contributed to the reduction of litter production of!: tortilis.
   Trends in woodlands in the floodplain might be associated with damming
   of the Turkwel River and local anthropogenic pressures. Also, the ekwar
   system of tree tenure seemed to be threatened by the official forestry
   policy that it be ignored. Incorporating the ekwar system into the
   forestry conservation policy may achieve sustainable use and improve
   conservation of the Turkwel River floodplain woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Dry tropical woodlands are the characteristic natural vegetation type of
   southeast Angola, where precipitation is seasonal and nutrient content
   of soils is very low. Subsistence farmers overcome the poor abiotic
   conditions by using shifting cultivation based on specific site
   selection. We describe the vegetation composition of a previously
   unstudied dense woodland tract, which is preferred for agriculture,
   comparing it to nearby open woodland. We placed 25 vegetation plots
   randomly in the two types of natural woodland vegetation (open and
   dense) as well as in fallows with three different durations of land use.
   In each plot the cover of all vascular plant species was recorded.
   Variables describing vegetation structure, including basal area and leaf
   area index, were recorded. We analyzed soil samples for texture, pH,
   conductivity and nutrients, and investigated the impact of land use
   duration on woodland regeneration. We found that species composition and
   vegetation structure of the dense woodland differed greatly from the
   surrounding open woodland. The dense woodland is preferable for
   agriculture because of its higher soil content of silt, clay and
   potassium, higher woody biomass, and more abundant soft litter. A longer
   duration of land use affects species composition and diversity of the
   regenerating vegetation as well as nutrient content in the soil. In the
   near future, the increasing demand for agricultural land is likely to
   change the structure and composition of the dense woodland.}},

Abstract = {{The present study undertook a hierarchical analysis of the variability
   within and among some individual fire events in the boreal ecozones of
   Canada and Alaska. When stratified by ecozone, differences in the
   spatial and temporal distribution of wildfires were observed in the
   Canadian Large Fire Data Base that reflect climatic, terrain and
   land-use differences across the country. Remote-sensing data collected
   before and after boreal forest fires permitted a rigorous analysis of
   the variability in burn severity within individual fire events, and the
   identification of certain fire-prone and more fire-resistant land-cover
   types. The occurrence of fire skips or islands was related to the
   distribution of those cover types, resulting in proportionally more
   unburned area within the perimeter of a burn for larger fires.
   Differences in burn severity led to differences in post-burn vegetation
   response of tree, shrub and moss layers that can persist for decades or
   even centuries. As a result, there can be considerable variability in
   the survival, density and distribution of residual biota and organic
   materials. This variability creates a range of post-fire vegetation

Journal = {{NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{93-105}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{In fire-adapted forest ecosystems around the world, there has been
   growing concern about adverse impacts of post-fire logging on native
   biodiversity and ecological processes. This is also true in conifer
   forests of California, U.S.A. which are home to a rare and declining owl
   subspecies, the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis
   occidentalis). While there has been recent concern about the California
   spotted owl occupancy in large fire areas where some territories have
   substantial high-severity fire effects, the influence of post-fire
   logging on the California spotted owl occupancy has been investigated
   very little, leading to some uncertainty about interpretation of
   conflicting results in different large fires. Research has found these
   owls preferentially select high-severity fire areas, characterised by
   high levels of snags and native shrubs, for foraging in forests that
   were not logged after fire, suggesting that removal of this foraging
   habitat might impact occupancy. The authors assessed the effect of
   post-fire logging and high-severity fire, on occupancy of this
   subspecies in eight large fire areas, within spotted owl sites with two
   different levels of high-severity fire effects. They found a significant
   adverse effect of such logging and no effect of high-severity fire
   alone. These results indicate it is post-fire logging, not large fires
   themselves, that poses a conservation threat to this imperilled species.}},

Volume = {{283}},
Number = {{1840}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{An emerging hypothesis in fire ecology is that pyrodiversity increases
   species diversity. We test whether pyrodiversity-defined as the standard
   deviation of fire severity-increases avian biodiversity at two spatial
   scales, and whether and how this relationship may change in the decade
   following fire. We use a dynamic Bayesian community model applied to a
   multi-year dataset of bird surveys at 1106 points sampled across 97
   fires in montane California. Our results provide strong support for a
   positive relationship between pyrodiversity and bird diversity. This
   relationship interacts with time since fire, with pyrodiversity having a
   greater effect on biodiversity at 10 years post-fire than at 1 year
   post-fire. Immediately after fires, patches of differing burn severities
   hold similar bird communities, but over the ensuing decade, bird
   assemblages within patches of contrasting severities differentiate. When
   evaluated at the scale of individual fires, fires with a greater
   heterogeneity of burn severities hold substantially more species. High
   spatial heterogeneity in severity, sometimes called `mixed-severity
   fire', is a natural part of wildfire regimes in western North America,

   suppression. Forest management that encourages mixed-severity fire may
   be critical for sustaining biodiversity across fire-prone landscapes.}},

Title = {{Fire intensity, fire severity and ecosystem response in heathlands:
   factors affecting the regeneration of Calluna vulgaris}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{356-365}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Upland heaths in the UK are of significant conservation importance.
   Large areas are managed through prescribed burning to improve habitat
   and grazing for red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, deer Cervus elaphus
   and sheep Ovis aries. Previous research has identified trends in
   vegetation development following burning, but has not linked this to
   variation in fire behaviour and severity.
   2. We burned 15 experimental fires on an area of Calluna
   vulgaris-dominated moorland, and recorded pre- and post-fire vegetation
   structure and composition, fire behaviour characteristics, and several
   `proxy measures' of fire severity.
   3. We distinguished measures of fire severity, describing the immediate
   physical effects of burning, from the long-term ecosystem responses of
   substrate development and Calluna regeneration. Proxy measures of fire
   severity did not relate strongly to fire behaviour or ecosystem
   response.
   4. Post-fire regeneration was strongly linked to stand age and post-fire
   substrate type. Fire behaviour and severity had little effect, though
   fire-induced ground-surface heating may promote Calluna seedling
   establishment. Vegetative regeneration of Calluna was extremely poor in
   older stands, as was seedling establishment in areas where the post-fire
   substrate was dominated by live or dead pleurocarpous moss mats.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Significant nonlinearities exist in fire
   severity on heathlands, with step changes related to the depth and
   moisture content of moss/litter layers and peat. Younger stands, less
   than c. 30 cm tall, should be the focus of management if the objective
   is to maximize Calluna regeneration. Burning older and uneven-aged
   stands is discouraged except for the purposes of fire hazard management.
   Managers should develop landscape-level burn plans to target burning
   effectively and create diverse fire regimes.}},

Abstract = {{1. The role of prescribed burning of vegetation to manage fire risk is
   controversial in a variety of situations worldwide. It is becoming more
   topical (i) as a result of potential global warming where the risk of
   wildfire might increase and (ii) because fire might affect the various
   ecosystem services provided in a different way. Where prescribed fire is
   used, ecologists need to know the impact on biodiversity (post-fire
   recovery) and on provisioning and regulating services such as water
   collection and carbon sequestration. Here, we assess the effect of
   prescribed burning on plant community composition and its component
   species at the regional scale of the Peak District, where the moorland
   vegetation is severely degraded.
   2. Species cover (\%) was assessed on five moors with respect to elapsed
   time since prescribed burning and vegetation height. A stratified random
   method was used to choose burn patches covering a range of ages since
   burning; quadrats were then sampled randomly within these patches over a
   3-year period. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to relate
   species composition to significant environmental variables, and
   variation partitioning was used to assess their relative contribution.
   Response curves were produced for the major species with respect to
   elapsed time since burning and vegetation height.
   3. The species ordination produced two gradients, (i) a continuum from a
   graminoid-dominated vegetation to one dominated by Erica tetralix,
   Vaccinium myrtillus and Rubus chamaemorus and (ii) a post-fire growth
   response of the dominant species, Calluna vulgaris. Species composition
   was more highly correlated with vegetation height than elapsed time
   since burning. The environmental variables explained 15.2\% of the
   variation.
   4. Calluna vulgaris was the only species to show an increasing response
   after burning; all others showed an increase immediately after burning,
   but then they either decreased or showed a unimodal/skewed response.
   Most other species were restricted to vegetation <40 cm height and 20-25
   years after burning. 5. Synthesis and applications. We found two major
   results of importance to policy makers and land managers: (i) that
   prescribed burning maintains species diversity in the immediate
   post-burn phase, and (ii) as the vegetation ages and increases in
   height, most species disappear and the vegetation becomes dominated by
   C. vulgaris. From a policy perspective, prescribed burning (or some
   other disturbance) is needed to maintain burning and a no-burn policy
   will result in a low-diversity, C. vulgaris-dominated vegetation. As
   vegetation height is the easiest measure for land managers to use in
   judging when to burn, we recommend moorland vegetation be burned before
   it reaches 25 cm in height to maintain the pre-burn complement of plant
   species. If the rotation allows the vegetation to become much taller
   (>40 cm), then most species will be lost and they will have to colonize
   after subsequent fires from the seedbank or from the surrounding area.}},

   bryophytes dominated the plots which had experienced the highest fire

   Pleurocarpous mosses were dominant only in the older closed stands.
   Different patterns of regeneration strategies were described: spores

Abstract = {{Severe wildfires are often followed by significant increase in runoff
   and erosion, due to vegetation damage and changes in physical and

   useful in selecting the effectiveness of a rehabilitation method. In
   this paper a distributed model based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss

   organic matter content, and RUSLE factors related to soil cover and
   protection measures.
   Model results, validated using measured data on erosion rates from the
   literature and in situ field campaigns, show the effect of the analyzed
   rehabilitation treatments in reducing the amount of soil losses with the
   peculiar characteristics of the spatial distribution of such changes. In
   particular, the mulching treatment substantially decreases erosion both
   in its mean value (- 75 \%) and in the spatially distribution of the
   erosion levels over the burned area. On the contrary, the breaking up of
   the hydrophobic layer decreases postfire mean soil losses of about the
   14 \%, although it strongly influences the spatial distribution of the
   erosion levels.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have highlighted the potential of linking fire behaviour
   to plant ecophysiology as an improved route to characterising severity,
   but research to date has been limited to laboratory-scale
   investigations. Fine-scale fire behaviour during prescribed fires has
   been identified as a strong predictor of post-fire tree recovery and
   growth, but most studies report these metrics averaged over the entire
   fire. Previous research has found inconsistent effects of low-intensity
   fire on mature Pinus ponderosa growth. In this study, fire behaviour was
   quantified at the tree scale and compared with post-fire radial growth
   and axial resin duct defences. Results show a clear dose-response
   relationship between peak fire radiative power per unit area (Wm(-2))
   and post-fire Pinus ponderosa radial growth. Unlike in previous
   laboratory research on seedlings, there was no dose-response
   relationship observed between fire radiative energy per unit area ( J
   m(-2)) and post-fire mature tree growth in the surviving trees. These
   results may suggest that post-fire impacts on growth of surviving
   seedlings and mature trees require other modes of heat transfer to
   impact plant canopies. This study demonstrates that increased resin duct
   defence is induced regardless of fire intensity, which may decrease
   Pinus ponderosa vulnerability to secondary mortality agents.}},

Title = {{Harvested forests as a surrogate to wildfires in relation to grizzly
   bear food-supply in west-central Alberta}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{456}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations residing in interior ecosystems
   of North America are known to frequent harvested areas and areas burnt
   by wildfires, as both disturbances encourage growth of early seral
   vegetation preferred by them. This is especially evident in places where
   there is a paucity of large natural openings and areas with a long
   history of wildfire suppression, such as the foothill forests of
   west-central Alberta. Little has been done, however, to directly
   quantify and compare grizzly bear food-supply in both disturbance types
   and at early stages of forest regeneration. In this paper, we explore
   whether harvested areas can act as surrogates to wildfires for grizzly
   bear food-supply in west-central Alberta, Canada. We sampled known
   fruit-bearing and herbaceous grizzly bear foods for their occurrence,
   productivity, and digestible energy supply among post-harvest,
   post-fire, and mature forests disturbance types, and across very young
   (similar to 5 yrs), young (similar to 20 yrs), and mid (similar to 60
   yrs) age-classes for post-harvest and post-fire disturbances. A variety
   of foods occurred at greater frequency in post-harvest stands, with the
   occurrence of most foods explained by the main effects of disturbance
   and age-class, or in combination with one environmental covariate.
   Overall, fruit productivity and digestible energy from fruits were
   highest in the young age-class, whereas forb productivity and digestible
   energy from forbs were highest in the very young age-class. There were
   no significant differences in total available digestible energy (fruit +
   forb) between post-harvest and post-fire stands within any age-class,
   but significant differences were evident between age-classes. These
   results suggest that harvested areas can potentially act as a surrogate
   to wildfires in relation to grizzly bear food-supply, but human access
   remains a key challenge for harvests given their association with roads.
   We suggest that harvested areas could be used as management tool to
   maintain or enhance grizzly bear food-supply and thus contribute to
   population recovery efforts, especially in areas of wildfire
   suppression.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are altering ecosystems globally as they change in frequency,
   size, and severity. As wildfires change vegetation structure, they also
   alter moisture inputs and energy fluxes which influence snowpack and
   hydrology. In unburned forests, snow has been shown to accumulate more
   in small clearings or in stands with low to moderate forest densities.
   Here we investigate whether peak snowpack varies with burn severity or
   percent overstory tree mortality post-fire in a mid-latitude, subalpine
   forest. We found that peak snowpack across the burn severity gradients
   increased 15\% in snow-water equivalence (SWE) and 17\% in depth for
   every 20\% increase in overstory tree mortality due to burn severity.
   Snowpack quantity varied greatly between the two winter seasons sampled
   in this study with 114\% more snow in 2016 versus 2015, yet the effect
   of burn severity on snowpack remained consistent. These data support
   previous studies showing increases in peak snow depth and SWE in burned
   forests but for the first time provides novel insights into how snow
   depth and SWE change as a function of burn severity. We conclude that
   changes not only in the frequency and size of wildfires, but also in the
   severity, can alter peak snow depth and SWE, with important potential
   implications for watershed hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we characterised the composition and configuration of
   post-fire residual habitats belonging to two physiographic zones of the
   black spruce-moss domain in western Quebec. Thirty-three large fires
   (2000-52 000 ha) were selected and extracted on classified Landsat
   satellite imagery. The results show that a minimum of 2\% and a maximum
   of 22\% of burned areas escaped fire, with an overall average of 10.4\%.
   The many forest patches that partially or entirely escaped fire formed
   residual habitats (RHs). It was found that although the area of RHs
   follows a linear relationship with fire size, their proportion appears
   relatively constant. Spatial analyses showed that the fires could be
   separated into two groups depending on the physiographic zones
   (East-Canadian Shield v. West-Clay Belt Lowlands). Fires in the west
   zone generate less RHs and appear to be associated with more extreme
   weather conditions. In most cases there was no association with water or
   wetlands; in some fires the presence of RHs is associated with the
   proximity of water bodies. The failure to find an association between
   RHs and wetlands suggests that this type of environment is part of the
   fuel. Coniferous woodland with moss appears particularly overrepresented
   within RHs. Our results suggest that the local and regional
   physiographic conditions strongly influence the creation of RHs;
   therefore, it is important to consider those differences when applying
   ecosystem-based management.}},

Abstract = {{Wildland fires play a key role in the functioning and structure of
   vegetation. The availability of sensors aboard satellites, such as
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), makes possible
   the construction of a time series of vegetation indices (VI) and the
   monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery. One of the techniques used
   to monitor post-fire vegetation is the comparison of a burned site with
   an adjacent unburned control site. However, to date, there is no
   objective method available for selecting these unburned control sites.
   We propose three biological criteria that the unburned sites must meet
   to be considered control sites, as well as statistical methods based on
   the analysis of the properties of the Quotient Vegetation Indices time
   series (QVI), to detect unburned sites that meet the proposed criteria.
   We also test the performance of the proposed method by checking the
   pre-fire difference between burned and unburned sites, assuming that the
   higher the number of met criteria, the greater the similarity.
   Therefore, we compare the differences between VI time series of burned
   sites and VI time series of unburned sites with the same vegetation
   cover that meet three, two, one, and none of the proposed criteria. In
   addition, we compare the quality of QVI time series that meet three,
   two, one, and none of the proposed criteria. Our results show that, for
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation
   Index (EVI) data, the difference between the time series of burned and
   unburned sites gradually decreases with the increase of met criteria. A
   gradual increase is also observed in the quality of the QVI time series
   with the increase of met criteria. Despite the limitations present in
   the proposed method, our model represents an advance from the conceptual
   and methodological standpoints, since this is the first proposal of a
   statistical method for selecting unburned control sites based on
   biological criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Fire in riparian areas has the potential to influence the functions
   riparian vegetation provides to streams and aquatic biota. However,
   there is little information on the effects of fire on riparian areas.
   The objectives of the present study were to: (i) determine how fire
   severity interacts with riparian topographic setting,
   micro-environmental conditions, and pre-fire community composition to
   control post-fire regeneration; (ii) determine how riparian regeneration
   patterns and controls change during early succession; and (iii)
   determine how critical riparian functions are influenced by and recover
   after fire. Study locations included the Biscuit Fire in southwestern
   Oregon and the B\&B Complex Fire in the Cascade Mountain Range of
   west-central Oregon, USA. We measured post-fire woody species
   regeneration, and measured factors such as fire severity, pre-fire
   species composition, and stream size as potential factors associated
   with post-fire regeneration patterns. At a relatively coarse spatial
   scale, patterns in post-fire colonization were influenced by elevation.
   At finer spatial scales, both conifer- and hardwood-dominated riparian
   plant communities were self-replacing, suggesting that each community
   type tends to occur in specific ecological settings. Abundant post-fire
   regeneration in riparian areas and the self-replacement of hardwood-and
   conifer-dominated communities indicate high resilience of these
   disturbance-adapted plant communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mapping of regional fires would make it possible to analyse their
   environmental, social and economic impact, as well as to develop better
   fire management systems. However, automatic mapping of burnt areas has
   proved to be a challenging task, due to the wide diversity of vegetation
   cover worldwide and the heterogeneous nature of fires themselves. Here,
   we present an algorithm for the automatic mapping of burnt areas using
   medium-resolution optical images. Although developed for Landsat images,
   it can be also applied to Sentinel-2 images without modification. The
   algorithm draws upon the classical concept of differences in pre- and
   post-fire reflectance, but also takes advantage of the object-oriented
   approach and a new threshold calculation method. It consists of four
   steps. The first concerns the calculation of spectral indices and their
   differences, together with differences in spectral layers based on pre-
   and post-fire images. In the second step, multiresolution segmentation
   and masking are performed (clouds, water bodies and non-vegetated areas
   are removed from further analysis). Thirdly, `core' burnt areas are
   detected using automatically-adjusted thresholds. Thresholds are
   calculated on the basis of specific functions established for difference
   layers. The last step combines neighbourhood analysis and patch growing
   to define the final shape of burnt areas. The algorithm was tested in 27
   areas located worldwide, and covered by various types of vegetation.
   Comparisons with manual interpretation show that the fully-automated
   classification is accurate. Over 82\% of classifications were considered
   satisfactory (overall accuracy > 90\%; user and producer accuracy >
   70\%).}},

Abstract = {{We explore patterns of diversity of plant functional types (PFTs) in
   Mediterranean communities subjected to landscape-scale fire disturbances
   in a mosaic of uncultivated and old fields stands. We use regenerative
   and growth form attributes to establish two sets of PFTs of perennial
   species living in shrublands and pine forests of NE Spain. We test the
   following hypotheses: 1. Fire frequency decreases regenerative PFTs
   diversity by negatively selecting attributes with low regenerative
   efficiency. 2. Fire history has more influence on regenerative than on
   growth form PFTs. 3. The lowest diversity of growth form PFTs will be in
   old fields without recent fires.
   We surveyed stands of different combinations of fire and land use
   histories. Fire history included areas without fires in the last twenty
   years (unburned), sites burned in 1982 (1-burned), and sites burned in
   1982 and 1994 (2-burned). Land use histories considered terraced old
   fields, and uncultivated stands on stony soils. We analysed patterns of
   PFT abundance and diversity at the stand level, and across the landscape
   (among stands absolute deviations from sample medians of the relative
   cover of PFTs).
   At the stand level, fire had more influence on the diversity patterns of
   regenerative PFTs than on growth form PFT. Fire decreased the diversity
   of regenerative PFTs, due to the elimination of the species without
   effective mechanisms to post-fire regeneration. This effect was not
   observed across the landscape, but seeders showed more variation in
   stands with longer history without fire. Land use contributed to explain
   the diversity patterns of growth form PFT (i.e. the number of growth
   form PFTs was lower in uncultivated, unburned sites), but it did not
   influence regenerative PFTs diversity. Patterns of PFTs diversity
   reflect the response to ecological processes operating at the landscape
   level. Overall, regenerative and growth form PFTs appear to be more
   sensitive to the fire history than to the past land use.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of early successional and open habitats often requires
   active removal of encroaching vegetation. In many cases, fire or other
   historically applied methods can no longer maintain or create open or
   early-successional habitat. In these situations, managers must employ
   mechanical or chemical treatments to control vegetation and improve
   habitat quality for wildlife that depend on open habitats. We conducted
   a large-scale study of tree removal from 2005 to 2011 on 14 grassland
   sites in central North America. Beginning in the autumn of 2005, shrubs,
   scattered trees, shelterbelts and woodlots were removed from six of
   fourteen study sites with cutting and burning treatments. Trees and
   shrubs accounted for 7-21\% of pre-treatment ground cover. We conducted
   vegetation and bird surveys on each site for oneyear before and sixyears
   after initiating tree removal treatments. Treatments effectively removed
   larger woody vegetation (>6m in height), but effects of shrub removal
   were less consistent due to rapid regrowth. Tree removal sites also
   experienced reductions in grassy litter as a result of prescribed fires
   that were used to discourage shrub and tree regrowth. On untreated
   sites, abundance of all grassland birds declined throughout the study,
   on average declining by 62\%. On tree removal sites, we estimated that
   grassland bird abundance dropped from 204 (birds per count) before
   treatment to a low of 090 in the second year after initiating
   treatments, but recovered in the final threeyears of study with a weak,
   but significant positive response sixyears after initiating treatment,
   with an estimated 142 birds per count. Waterfowl and wetland birds
   increased following tree removal, whereas woodland birds, particularly
   those that nest in cavities, declined on treated sites.Synthesis and
   applications. Tree removal did appear to improve habitat suitability for
   grassland birds, but a positive response was weak and delayed, and
   treatments caused short-term habitat disturbances that significantly
   reduced abundance of target species. When planning large-scale tree
   removal, it may be beneficial to allow undisturbed habitat in the

Title = {{Temporal changes in the breeding bird community caused by post-fire
   treatments after the Samcheok forest fire in Korea}},

Abstract = {{The Samcheok forest fire of April 2000 was the biggest stand-replacing
   fire recorded in Korea, and led to the largest-scale salvage logging
   operation (performed until 2005) ever implemented. We investigated the
   effects of the treatments performed after the fire on the breeding bird
   community in 2002-2005 (the management period) and 2006-2008 (the
   post-management period). A total of 75 line transect surveys resulted in
   660 detections of 54 species in undisturbed stands (CO), in burned and
   naturally restored stands (NI), and in burned and logged stands (IT).
   Four species (Parus major, Aegithalos caudatus, Dendrocopos kizuki, and
   Parus ater) were identified as indicator species in CO which showed no
   temporal changes in bird communities and habitat structure. Among the
   various stand treatments, the standardized species richness was highest
   in CO (11.6 +/- A 4.6 species/transect in 2002-2005, 12.1 +/- A 3.5 in
   2006-2008), and this richness did not change over time. On the other
   hand, low richness was observed in NI (6.8 +/- A 2.6 in 2002-2005, 9.6
   +/- A 2.3 in 2006-2008), and the lowest richness was seen in IT (5.0 +/-
   A 2.4 in 2002-2005, 6.1 +/- A 1.8 in 2006-2008), but both of these
   increased over time. Although the bird abundances in NI and IT were
   lower than those in CO (38.0 +/- A 27.7 birds/transect in 2002-2005,
   31.3 +/- A 10.9 in 2006-2008), the abundances in NI (15.1 +/- A 8.6 in
   2002-2005, 17.6 +/- A 11.4 in 2006-2008) and IT (11.7 +/- A 8.3 in
   2002-2005, 10.0 +/- A 4.6 in 2006-2008) were not significantly
   different. There was no significant difference in abundance between time
   periods for any of the stand treatments. These results imply that NI
   (i.e., no salvage logging) allows greater bird richness but not
   abundance to be recovered compared to IT. No indicator species was
   consistently present in NI throughout the two time periods covered due
   to the rapid regrowth of vegetation, but four open-habitat dwellers
   (Falco tinnunculus, Phoenicurus auroreus, Emberiza cioides, and Sturnus
   cineraceus) colonized IT during the post-management period. The bird
   assemblage in IT, as assessed by canonical correspondence analysis,
   shifted to open habitats, while the avifauna in NI became similar to
   that in CO over time. While post-fire treatment can provide new
   colonization opportunities for open-habitat dwellers, the slow
   colonization process, the low species richness, and the low bird
   abundance observed in large areas of IT indicate that post-fire
   treatment using salvage logging inhibits the restoration of forest bird
   communities by producing a poorer breeding bird community that is very
   different from the original one. Based on these lessons from the
   response to the Samcheok forest fire, we suggest that preserving as much
   of the disturbed forest as possible is essential, and that the current
   approach to post-fire treatment-intensive salvage logging-needs to be
   revised to ensure the effective restoration of breeding bird communities
   in disturbed temperate pine forests.}},

Abstract = {{It is unclear to what extent Native Americans in the pre-European

   Ecological models provide a way to test different scenarios of
   historical landscape change. We applied FARSITE, a spatially explicit
   fire model, and linked tree mortality and successional models, to
   predict the landscape structure of the Harlem Plains in pre-European
   times under different scenarios of Native American fire use. We found
   that annual burning sufficed to convert the landscape to a
   fire-maintained grassland ecosystem, burning less often would have
   produced a mosaic of forest and grasslands, and even less frequent
   burning (on the order of once every 20 years) would not have had
   significant landscape level effects. These results suggest that if the
   Harlem Plains had been grasslands in the 16th century, they must have
   been intentionally created through Native American use of fire. (c) 2007

   Effectiveness in reducing runoff and sediment yields from small

Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{93-111}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural straw, hydromulch, and wood shred or wood strand mulches
   increasingly are being used as post-fire hillslope treatments, but the
   differences in effectiveness among these mulch treatments are not fully
   understood. Following the 2002 Hayman fire in central Colorado and the
   2003 Cedar fire in southern California, matched catchments were
   monitored for five to seven post-fire years to determine the
   effectiveness of wheat straw mulch (Hayman fire only) and hydromulch in
   reducing post-fire runoff, peak flow rates, and sediment yields from
   natural rainfall. Measured runoff and sediment yields were caused by
   short duration high intensity summer storms at the Hayman fire and long
   duration winter rains at the Cedar fire.
   The wheat straw mulch treatment significantly reduced peak flow rates
   and sediment yields at the Hayman fire. The annual peak flow rates in
   the first two post-fire years in the straw mulch catchment were 4.5 and
   3.9 m(3) s(-1) km(-2) (respectively) as compared to 4.3 and 7.1 m(3)
   s(-1) km(-2) (respectively) in the control. In post-fire years one and
   two, the maximum event sediment yields in the straw mulch catchment were
   7.2 and 10 Mg ha(-1), respectively, which were less than half of the
   maximum event sediment yields in the control catchment (19 and 24 Mg
   ha(-1), respectively). The straw mulch catchment had no detectable
   runoff or sediment yield after the second post-fire year, but the
   control catchment continued to have measurable runoff and sediment
   yields through the seventh post-fire year. The straw mulch treatment
   effect in runoff reduction was not Significant in the statistical model.
   Total ground cover was 80\% immediately after the application of straw
   mulch, and decreased to 10\% by the end of first post-fire year, yet
   total ground cover values remained high as litter and vegetation,
   including invasive cheatgrass, increased.
   The hydromulch cover at both fires declined rapidly and provided less
   than 10\% of the ground cover within 2.5 months after application at
   which point the catchment was presumed to be untreated. Due to
   differences in precipitation, the three catchments at the Cedar fire had
   significantly different hydrologic responses during the presumed
   untreated portion of the study, which precluded evaluation of treatment
   effectiveness during the short treated period. The peak flow responses
   from the hydromulch and control catchments at the Hayman fire were also
   different during the presumed untreated period and were not tested.
   Although the runoff and sediment yields did not differ during the
   presumed untreated period and were tested for treatment effects, the
   Hayman hydromulch treatment did not significantly affect either response
   during the first post-fire year the presumed treated period.
   Unit-area sediment yields from the catchments were similar to those
   measured on hillslope plots at both the Hayman and Cedar fires in the
   first post-fire years, but in later years the sediment yields from the
   catchments were at least double the sediment yields measured on
   hillslope plots. The longer periods of greater erosion rates in the
   catchments likely reflect the addition of channel erosion processes and
   a difference in hydrologic connectivity at the catchment scale.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Global change models predict that high-latitude boreal forests will
   become increasingly susceptible to fire activity as climate warms,
   possibly causing a positive feedback to warming through fire-driven
   emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. However, fire-climate feedbacks
   depend on forest regrowth and carbon (C) accumulation over the post-fire
   successional interval, which is influenced by nitrogen (N) availability.
   To improve our understanding of post-fire C and N accumulation patterns
   in boreal forests, we evaluated above-and belowground C and N pools
   within 70 stands throughout interior Alaska, a region predicted to
   undergo a shift in canopy dominance as fire severity increases. Stands
   represented gradients in age and successional trajectory, from black
   spruce (Picea mariana) self-replacement to species replacement by
   deciduous species of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Alaska
   paper birch (Betula neoalaskana). Stands undergoing deciduous
   trajectories stored proportionally more of their C and N in aboveground
   stemwood and had 5-7 times faster rates of aboveground net primary
   productivity of trees compared to stands undergoing a black spruce
   trajectory, which stored more of their C and N in the soil organic layer
   (SOL), a thick layer of mostly undecomposed mosses. Thus, as
   successional trajectories shift, total C and N pool sizes will remain
   relatively unchanged, but there will be a trade-off in pool location and
   a potential increase in C and N longevity due to decreased flammability
   and decomposition rates of deciduous stemwood. Despite often warmer,
   drier conditions in deciduous compared to black spruce stands, deciduous
   stemwood has a C: N around 10 times higher than the black spruce SOL and
   often remains standing for many years with reduced exposure to fungal
   decomposers. Thus, a fire-driven shift in successional trajectories
   could cause a negative feedback to climate warming because of increased
   pool longevity in deciduous trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{Past fire recurrence impacts the vegetation structure, and it is
   consequently hypothesized to alter its future fire behaviour. We
   examined the fire behaviour in shrubland-forest mosaics of southeastern
   France, which were organized along a range of fire frequency (0 to 3-4
   fires along the past 50 years) and had different time intervals between
   fires. The mosaic was dominated by Quercus suber L. and Erica-Cistus
   shrubland communities. We described the vegetation structure through
   measurements of tree height, base of tree crown or shrub layer, mean
   diameter, cover, plant water content and bulk density. We used the
   physical model Firetec to simulate the fire behaviour. Fire intensity,
   fire spread, plant water content and biomass loss varied significantly
   according to fire recurrence and vegetation structure, mainly linked to
   the time since the last fire, then the number of fires. These results
   confirm that past fire recurrence affects future fire behaviour, with
   multilayered vegetation (particularly high shrublands) producing more
   intense fires, contrary to submature Quercus woodlands that have not
   burnt since 1959 and that are unlikely to reburn. Further simulations,
   with more vegetation scenes according to shrub and canopy covers, will

   heterogeneous vegetation, particularly in the Mediterranean area, with a
   view to a local management of these ecosystems. (C) 2015 Academie des

Abstract = {{Stand structure and fuel mass were measured in 2011, 13 years after
   logging of a seasonally dry, ponderosa pine dominated forest that had
   burned severely in the 1996 Summit Wildfire, Malheur National Forest,
   northeastern Oregon, U.S.A. Data are compared to those taken one year
   after post-fire logging (1999), and analyzed in the context of a second
   fire (Sunshine Fire) that burned through one of the four treatment
   blocks in 2008. Three treatments were evaluated in a randomized block
   experiment: unlogged control, commercial harvest (most dead merchantable
   trees removed), and fuel reduction harvest (most dead merchantable trees
   removed plus most dead trees > 10 cm diameter). Density and basal area
   of live trees trended downward between 1999 and 2011, but this delayed
   mortality was limited to smaller diameter stems. Dead tree basal area
   (snags) in unlogged stands declined over 12 years by 74\%, compared to
   an 84\% decline in logged stands over the same period. Higher snag fall
   rate in logged stands over time, combined with snag removal during
   logging in 1998, resulted in snag densities that were 22\% of unlogged
   stands by 2011. In unlogged mixed-species stands, Douglas-fir snags fell
   at the same rate as did ponderosa pine snags, but fir snags fell at a
   faster rate in logged stands. Slash fuel tripled over twelve years in
   unlogged stands, such that mean slash mass levels became equal for all
   treatments. Unlogged stands accumulated nearly double the mass of coarse
   woody debris as logged stands, with most of the difference observed in
   the sound component of coarse woody fuel. By 13 years after logging
   (2011), density of regeneration averaged higher overall for unlogged
   stands, but was highly variable and patchy across all study units.
   Finally, the Sunshine Fire burned through nearly one complete block of
   the experiment in 2008, and erased most of the effects of the 1998
   logging operation: snags were reduced to < 0.5 ha(-1) for all
   treatments, forest floor and slash fuel mass declined to near zero, log
   mass declined to about 25\% that observed in stands unburned by the
   Sunshine Fire, and shrubs, seedlings, and saplings were nearly
   eliminated. While the intermediate-term effects of the 1998 logging were
   still evident in 2011, the 1996 Summit Fire remained the most dominant
   recent disturbance evident on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Both disturbance history and previous land use influence present-day
   vegetation and soils. These influences can have important implications
   for conservation of plant communities if former disturbance and land use
   change species abundances, increase colonization of nonnative plant
   species or if they alter soil characteristics in ways that make them
   less suitable for species of conservation interest. We compared the
   plant species composition, the proportion of native and normative plant
   species, and soil biogeochemical characteristics across seven dominant
   land use and vegetation cover types on the outwash sandplain of Martha's
   Vineyard that differed in previous soil tillage, dominant overstory
   vegetation and history of recent prescribed fire. The outwash sandplain
   supports many native plant species adapted to dry, low nutrient
   conditions and maintenance of native species is a management concern.
   There was broad overlap in the plant species composition among pine
   (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus) plantations on untilled soils, pine
   plantations on formerly tilled soils, scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia)
   shrublands, tree oak (Q. velutina, Q. alba) woodlands, burned tree oak
   woodlands, and sandplain grasslands. All of these land cover categories
   contained few nonnative species. In contrast, agricultural grasslands
   had high richness and cover of normative plants. Soil characteristics
   were also similar among all of the woodland, shrubland and grassland
   land cover categories, but soils in agricultural grasslands had higher
   pH, extractable Ca2+ and Mg2+ in mineral soils and higher rates of net
   nitrification. The similarity of soils and significant overlap in
   vegetation across pine plantations, scrub oak shrublands, oak woodlands
   and sandplain grasslands suggests that the history of land use, current
   vegetation and soil characteristics do not pose a major barrier to
   management strategies that would involve conversion among any of these
   vegetation types. The current presence of high cover of normative
   species and nutrient-enriched soils in agricultural grasslands, however,
   may pose a barrier to expansion of sandplain grasslands or shrublands on
   these former agricultural lands if native species are not able to
   outcompete normative species in these anthropogenically-enriched sites.

Abstract = {{Fire is an important ecological process that shapes vegetation structure
   and habitat for faunal assemblages globally. Prescribed burns are
   increasingly being used in conservation and management to restore fire
   regimes in fire-suppressed vegetation communities. Small threatened
   macropods require structurally complex habitat that allows them to evade
   detection by predators. Given that fire can alter vegetation structure,
   it can be viewed as a strong ecological force in shifting the dynamics
   between predator and prey species. Previous studies in temperate
   Australia have shown that prescribed burns in the presence of European
   Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral Cat (Felis catus) can have negative
   impacts on small macropods and medium-sized mammals. Post-fire response
   of threatened small macropods and their predators has not been
   experimentally examined in subtropical Australia despite this region
   providing refugia for the Long-nosed Potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and
   Red-legged Pademelon (Thylogale stigmatica). We conducted a
   before-after-control-impact fire experiment at two paired sites after
   low-moderate intensity burns typical of cool season prescribed burns. We
   used camera trapping to investigate changes in activity of threatened
   small macropods and their predators. We also recorded vegetation change.
   Despite large reductions in ground and shrub cover, activity of small
   macropods and the Dingo (Canis dingo) did not change in response to
   fires. Therefore, the threat of dingo predation appears to have remained
   unchanged following the fires. Although feral cats and foxes were
   present, they showed negligible activity across our sites. Our study
   suggests that small-scale patchy ecological burns may not lead to
   increased predation of small macropods in our landscape. We attribute
   this to sufficient post-fire refugia and very low densities of foxes.}},

Abstract = {{Hillslopes are thought to be most susceptible to enhanced surface runoff
   and erosion immediately following wildfire due to removal of protective
   vegetation and litter cover, and in many cases a fire-induced reduction
   in soil wettability. This enhanced susceptibility declines as vegetation
   and litter layer recover. For logistical reasons, however, few Studies
   have been able to examine the responses of burnt terrain immediately
   following burning and little is therefore known about the effect of the
   wettable ash layer that often covers the ground until it is
   redistributed or removed by wind or water erosion.
   Here we quantify the effects of ash and needle cast ground cover on
   surface runoff generation and soil erodibility in the immediate
   post-fire period (2-10 days) following a severe wildfire in an Aleppo
   pine forest over calcareous soils in Mediterranean eastern Spain. A
   homogenous vegetation cover and lack of wind during the fire resulted in
   100\% ash cover (36 mm mean depth) across the study area. The ground
   fire did not consume the tree crowns, but its high intensity caused
   complete tree mortality, leading to subsequent needle fall. Hydrological
   and erosional responses were measured for fifteen 1-hour rainfall
   simulations (55 mm h(-1)) on 0.25 m(2) circular plots for each of three
   terrain types: (i) ash and needle covered, (ii) ash-only covered and
   (iii) bare. Furthermore, ash and needle cast cover were monitored over
   an eleven-week period on otherwise undisturbed terrain to examine its
   evolution during the first critical months following burning.
   The soils exhibited no or slight post-fire water repellency. The
   overlying wettable ash layer had a porosity of 83\%, providing a water
   storage capacity of similar to 30 mm. A third of the plots with ground
   cover did not generate any surface runoff. Ash-needle and ash-only plots
   showed 25- and 18-fold reductions in surface runoff respectively
   compared to bare terrain. Mean sediment yield from covered plots was
   more than two orders of magnitudes lower than from bare plots. The ash
   cover remained unchanged during the first two weeks while overlying
   needle cast more than doubled. Heavy rainfall (153 mm) over a subsequent
   six-day period removed the ash almost entirely where no needle cast was
   present, whereas on ash and needle covered ground only a limited
   redistribution and accumulation into litter dams occurred.
   The results quantify the potential importance of ash deposits on the
   susceptibility of hillslopes to surface runoff and erosion immediately
   following fire. The combination of ash and needle cast appears
   particularly effective in reducing hillslope responses. The Outcomes
   demonstrate clearly that the widely held notion of landscapes being most
   susceptible to surface runoff and erosion directly after burning is not
   Correct where a fire has resulted in substantial ash deposition.
   Instead, the susceptibility will be greatest following a storm event Of
   Sufficient severity to remove this protective layer and before the onset
   of vegetation recovery. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fire can result in hydro-geomorphic changes that are spatially variable
   and difficult to predict. In this research note we compile 294
   infiltration measurements and 10 other soil, catchment runoff and

   Australia and argue that higher aridity (a function of the long-term
   mean precipitation and net radiation) is associated with lower post-fire
   infiltration capacities, increasing the chance of surface runoff and
   strongly increasing the chance of debris flows. Post-fire debris flows
   were only observed in the more arid locations within the Victorian
   uplands, and resulted in erosion rates more than two orders of magnitude
   greater than non-debris flow processes. We therefore argue that aridity
   is a high-order control on the magnitude of post-wildfire
   hydro-geomorphic processes. Aridity is a landscape-scale parameter that
   is mappable at a high resolution and therefore is a useful predictor of
   the spatial variability of the magnitude of post-fire hydro-geomorphic

Abstract = {{Pinyon (Pinusspp.) and juniper (Juniperusspp.) woodland encroachment
   into sagebrush (Artemisiaspp.) steppe communities throughout western
   North America has substantially altered the vegetation structure and
   hydrologic function of one of the most ecologically important rangeland
   ecosystems in the world. Various pinyon and juniper tree removal
   practices are employed to re-establish sagebrush steppe vegetation and
   an associated resource-conserving ecohydrologic function. The
   effectiveness of these practices is highly variable owing to the vast
   domain in which woodland encroachment occurs, climate fluctuations,
   differences in treatment applications, and myriads of pre-treatment
   conditions and post-treatment land uses. This study evaluated the
   long-term (13 years post-treatment) effectiveness of prescribed fire and
   mechanical tree removal to re-establish sagebrush steppe vegetation and
   associated spatial patterns in ground surface conditions and soil
   hydrologic properties of two woodland-encroached sites. Specifically, we
   assessed the effects of tree removal on: (1) vegetation and ground cover
   at the hillslope scale (990 m(2)plots) and (2) associated spatial
   patterns in point-scale ground surface conditions and soil hydrologic
   properties along transects extending from tree bases and into the
   intercanopy areas between trees. Both sites were in mid to late stages
   of woodland encroachment with extensive bare conditions (similar to
   60-80\% bare ground) throughout a degraded intercanopy area (similar to
   75\% of the domain) surrounding tree islands (similar to 25\% of domain,
   subcanopy areas). All treatments effectively removed mature tree cover
   and increased hillslope vegetation. Enhanced herbaceous cover (4-15-fold
   increases) in burned areas reduced bare interspace (bare area between
   plants) by at least 4-fold and improved intercanopy hydraulic
   conductivity (> than 2-fold) and overall ecohydrologic function.
   Mechanical treatments retained or increased sagebrush and generally
   increased the intercanopy herbaceous vegetation. Intercanopy ground
   surface conditions and soil hydrologic properties in mechanical
   treatments were generally similar to those in burned areas but were also
   statistically similar to the same measures in untreated areas in most
   cases. This suggests that vegetation and ground surface conditions in
   mechanical treatments are trending toward a significantly improved
   hydrologic function over time. Treatments had limited impact on soil
   hydrologic properties within subcanopy areas; however, burning did
   reduce the soil water repellency strength and the occurrence of strong
   soil water repellency underneath trees by three- to four-fold. Overall,
   the treatments over a 13-year period enhanced the vegetation, ground
   surface conditions, and soil hydrologic properties that promote
   infiltration and limit runoff generation for intercanopy areas
   representing similar to 75\% of the area at the sites. However,
   ecological tradeoffs in treatment alternatives were evident. The
   variations in woodland responses across sites, treatments, and
   measurement scales in this long-term study illustrate the complexity in
   predicting vegetation and hydrologic responses to tree removal on
   woodland-encroached sagebrush sites and underpin the need and value of
   multi-scale long-term studies.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of vegetation following fire has been studied intensively
   in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Little attention, however, has been
   given to floral traits, and almost no data have been collected on the
   effects of fire on pollinator activity and fruit-set. This paper reports
   the effects of fire on flower visitation rates and the possibly related
   fruit-set. We compared visitation rates of the main pollinators on four
   plant core-species in burned and adjacent unburned areas. Measurements
   were performed at an unburned phrygana (scrub lands), and at a burned
   area (5-7 years post-fire). Bumble bees and solitary bees were the main
   taxa of visitors, while few honeybees were recorded. Solitary bees were
   almost absent from the burned area. Fruit-set was significantly higher
   in the unburned area for three out of the four plant species. The lower
   fruit-set in the burned area was possibly the result of low activity of
   solitary bees which are the main effective pollinators of the examined
   species. We hypothesize that the populations of the solitary bees were
   diminished or extirpated either directly by the fire, or indirectly by
   the scarcity of nectar in the early post-fire years due to dominance of
   young pine and Cistus spp. seedlings. The short foraging range of the
   solitary bees and their slow invasion rate into the burned area may
   explain our results.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires, whether caused naturally or by human activity can have
   disastrous effects on the environment. Turkey, located in the
   Mediterranean climate zone, experiences hundreds of forest fires every
   year. Over the past two decades, these fires have destroyed
   approximately 308000 ha of forest area, threatening the sustainability
   of its ecosystem. This study analyzes the forest fire that occurred in
   the Menderes region of Izmir on July 1, 2017, by using pre- and
   post-fire Sentinel 2 (10 m and 20 m) and Landsat 8 (30 m) satellite
   images, MODIS and VIIRS fire radiative power (FRP) data (1000 m and 375
   m, respectively), and reference data obtained from a field study. Hence,
   image processing techniques integrated with the Geographic Information
   System (GIS) database were applied to a satellite image data set to
   monitor, analyze, and map the effects of the forest fire. The results
   show that the land surface temperature (LST) of the burned forest area
   increased from 1 to 11 degrees C. A high correlation (R = 0.81) between
   LST and burn severity was also determined. The burned areas were
   calculated using two different classification methods, and their
   accuracy was compared with the reference data. According to the accuracy
   assessment, the Sentinel (10 m) image classification gave the best
   result (96.43\% for Maximum Likelihood, and 99.56\% for Support Vector
   Machine). The relationship between topographical/forest parameters, burn
   severity and disturbance index was evaluated for spatial pattern
   distribution. According to the results, the areas having canopy closure
   between 71\%-100\% and slope above 35\% had the highest burn incidence.
   As a final step, a spatial correlation analysis was performed to
   evaluate the effectiveness of MODIS and VIIRS FRP data in the post-fire
   analysis. A high correlation was found between FRP-slope, and FRP-burn
   severity (0.96 and 0.88, respectively).}},

   evaluating the impact of climate and geophysical variables on response.
   Eighty-two watersheds were identified with at least 10 years of
   continuous pre-fire daily streamflow records and 5 years of continuous
   post-fire daily flow records. Percent change in annual runoff ratio, low
   flows, high flows, peak flows, number of zero flow days, baseflow index,
   and Richards-Baker flashiness index were calculated for each watershed
   using pre- and post-fire periods. Independent variables were identified
   for each watershed and fire event, including topographic, vegetation,
   climate, burn severity, percent area burned, and soils data.
   Results show that low flows, high flows, and peak flows increase in the
   first 2 years following a wildfire and decrease over time. Relative
   response was used to scale response variables with the respective
   percent area of watershed burned in order to compare regional
   differences in watershed response. To account for variability in
   precipitation events, runoff ratio was used to compare runoff directly
   to PRISM precipitation estimates. To account for regional differences in
   climate patterns, watersheds were divided into nine regions, or
   clusters, through k-means clustering using climate data, and regression
   models were produced for watersheds grouped by total area burned.
   Watersheds in Cluster 9 (eastern California, western Nevada, Oregon)
   demonstrate a small negative response to observed flow regimes after
   fire. Cluster 8 watersheds (coastal California) display the greatest
   flow responses, typically within the first year following wildfire. Most
   other watersheds show a positive mean relative response. In addition,
   simple regression models show low correlation between percent watershed
   burned and streamflow response, implying that other watershed factors
   strongly influence response.
   Spearman correlation identified NDVI, aridity index, percent of a
   watershed's precipitation that falls as rain, and slope as being
   positively correlated with post-fire streamflow response. This metric
   also suggested a negative correlation between response and the soil
   erodibility factor, watershed area, and percent low burn severity.
   Regression models identified only moderate burn severity and watershed
   area as being consistently positively/negatively correlated,
   respectively, with response. The random forest model identified only
   slope and percent area burned as significant watershed parameters
   controlling response.
   Results will help inform post-fire runoff management decisions by
   helping to identify expected changes to flow regimes, as well as
   facilitate parameterization for model application in burned watersheds.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In the hydrological cycle, evapotranspiration (ET) transfers moisture
   from the land surface to the atmosphere and is sensitive to disturbances
   such as wildfires. Ground-based pre- and post-fire measurements of ET
   are often unavailable, limiting the potential to understand the extent
   of wildfire impacts on the hydrological cycle. This research estimated
   both pre- and post-fire ET using remotely sensed variables and support
   vector machine (SVM) methods. Input variables (land surface temperature,
   modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, normalized difference moisture
   index, normalized burn ratio, precipitation, potential
   evapotranspiration, albedo and vegetation types) were used to train and
   develop 56 combinations that yielded 33 unique SVM models to predict
   actual ET. The models were trained to predict a spatial ET, the
   Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), for the 2003
   Coyote Fire in San Diego, California (USA). The optimal SVM model,
   SVM-ET6, required six input variables and predicted ET for fifteen years
   with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 8.43 mm/month and a R-2 of 0.89.
   The developed model was transferred and applied to the 2003 Old Fire in
   San Bernardino, California (USA), where a watershed balance approach was
   used to validate SVM-ET6 predictions. The annual water balance for ten
   out of fifteen years was within +/- 20\% of the predicted values. This
   work demonstrated machine learning as a viable method to create a
   remotely-sensed estimate with wide applicability for regions with sparse
   data observations and information. This innovative work demonstrated the
   potential benefit for land and forest managers to understand and analyze
   the hydrological cycle of watersheds that experience acute disturbances

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Soil burn severity indexes have been developed to rapidly assess
   ecosystem damage from vegetation fires and predict associated risks
   during the post-fire period. In terms of the hydrological impacts of
   fire, the lack of measurable relationships between the commonly
   determined parameters and post-fire hydrological responses has limited
   their potential to predict and mitigate post-fire hazards. This study
   examines the link between post-fire organic matter characteristics, and
   main soil physical and hydrological properties (clay content, bulk
   density, aggregate stability, water retention, water repellency,
   rainfall-runoff ratio and sediment concentration in runoff) in order to
   explore the potential use of organic matter characteristics as a proxy
   for the fire impact on hydrology-related soil properties. Soil samples
   from five fire-affected burned and unburned control sites in Andisols
   areas of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain), studied previously for
   hydrological processes, were selected and thermogravimetric (TG)
   analysis was carried out to evaluate fire impacts on their organic
   matter composition. The TG data were used to perform simple linear
   regressions with soil hydrological properties. The organic matter
   composition was relatively homogeneous among the unburned sites, despite
   substantial within and between site variability regarding other soil
   properties examined which simplified the assessment of soil burn
   severity. The fire led to a decrease in the relative amount of the
   labile organic matter pool and an increase in the recalcitrant and/or
   refractory pool depending on study site. The TG data, using 10 degrees C
   temperature range steps, allowed reasonable prediction of most soil
   properties and parameters, with R-2 ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 and with R-2
   >= 0.6 for 6 of the 8 parameters evaluated. The labile pool and the
   dehydration range positively affected bulk density, aggregate stability,
   wilting point and water repellency and negatively field capacity and
   sediment concentration, whereas the refractory pool showed the opposite
   trend. The recalcitrant pool was unrelated to other soil properties
   except for clay content and runoff. These results, in conjunction with
   the simplicity of the TG analysis suggest that, after an initial
   calibration step to link TG data to site-specific post-fire soil
   properties, the novel approach introduced in this study could serve as a
   useful tool for the rapid and cost-effective evaluation of soil burn
   severity, and anticipated soil hydrological responses after a fire. (C)

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fire is one of the main factors directly impacting Amazonian forest
   biomass and dynamics. Because of Amazonia's large geographical extent,
   remote sensing techniques are required for comprehensively assessing
   forest fire impacts at the landscape level. In this context, Light
   Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) stands out as a technology capable of
   retrieving direct measurements of vegetation vertical arrangement, which
   can be directly associated with aboveground biomass. This work aims, for
   the first time, to quantify post-fire changes in forest canopy height
   and biomass using airborne LiDAR in western Amazonia. For this, the
   present study evaluated four areas located in the state of Acre, called
   Rio Branco, Humaita, Bonal and Talisma. Rio Branco and Humaita burned in
   2005 and Bonal and Talisma burned in 2010. In these areas, we
   inventoried a total of 25 plots (0.25 ha each) in 2014. Humaita and
   Talisma are located in an open forest with bamboo and Bonal and Rio
   Branco are located in a dense forest. Our results showed that even ten
   years after the fire event, there was no complete recovery of the height
   and biomass of the burned areas (p < 0.05). The percentage difference in
   height between control and burned sites was 2.23\% for Rio Branco,
   9.26\% for Humaita, 10.03\% for Talisma and 20.25\% for Bonal. All
   burned sites had significantly lower biomass values than control sites.
   In Rio Branco (ten years after fire), Humaita (nine years after fire),
   Bonal (four years after fire) and Talisma (five years after fire)
   biomass was 6.71\%, 13.66\%, 17.89\% and 22.69\% lower than control
   sites, respectively. The total amount of biomass lost for the studied
   sites was 16,706.3 Mg, with an average loss of 4176.6 Mg for sites
   burned in 2005 and 2890 Mg for sites burned in 2010, with an average
   loss of 3615 Mg. Fire impact associated with tree mortality was clearly
   detected using LiDAR data up to ten years after the fire event. This
   study indicates that fire disturbance in the Amazon region can cause
   persistent above-ground biomass loss and subsequent reduction of forest
   carbon stocks. Continuous monitoring of burned forests is required for
   depicting the long-term recovery trajectory of fire-affected Amazonian
   forests.}},

Journal = {{SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-40}},
Abstract = {{Mulching treatment is often recommended in order to reduce post-fire
   erosion and sediment yields, but information concerning their effects on
   soil properties and hence on soil quality is scarce. In the present
   investigation, the influence of straw application on soil quality was
   evaluated on hillslope shrubland in Savinao (Lugo, NW Spain) that is
   susceptible to post-fire erosion (38\% slope). In this area, which was
   affected by a medium-high severity wildfire in September 2012, different
   treatments with wheat straw were applied to the burnt soil in mulch
   strips (0.8 and 1 Mg ha(-1)) using quadruplicate 10 m x 40 m plots and
   compared with the corresponding burnt untreated control. Soil samples
   were collected from the A horizon (0-2.5 cm depth) at different sampling
   times for 12 months after the wildfire, and a wide range of
   physicochemical, chemical and biochemical soil properties (water
   retention, pH, electric conductivity, total C, C-13, extractable C,
   water soluble C, soluble carbohydrates, total N, N-15, microbial biomass
   C, soil respiration, bacterial activity, beta-glucosidase, urease and
   phosphatase activities) were analyzed. The results showed that the
   application of straw mulch had a minor influence on the post-fire soil
   quality but, in contrast, the sampling time showed a significant
   influence attributed to short- and medium term changes in soil
   properties induced by both fire and climatic conditions.}},

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{107-114}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{One of the consequences of wildfires is the modification of the
   hydrology of the affected area, usually resulting in increased overland
   flow and soil erosion. In this work, we tested granular anionic
   polyacrylamide (PAM) to reduce post-fire soil erosion, and the
   mechanisms by which this polymer modifies infiltration rate (IR), runoff
   and soil loss. Two contrasting soils affected by fire were exposed to
   three consecutive simulated rainstorms separated by drying periods.
   During the 1st rainstorm, PAM decreased IR and increased runoff in both
   soils while soil loss was reduced compared to the untreated controls. In
   the following storms, the reduction in soil loss persisted, but the
   effect of PAM on IR and runoff was reversed. The reduction of soil loss
   was attributed to two mechanisms: (i) an increase of the viscosities of
   runoff and soil solution as PAM dissolved during the 1st storm, which
   resulted in more runoff but with reduced erosivity; and (ii) the
   stabilization of soil aggregates throughout the 1 st rainstorm and
   drying period, when PAM was irreversibly adsorbed to soil particles.
   Field erosion plots constructed on a burnt area in Birya forest, Israel,
   confirmed the laboratory results. The application of 25 and 50 kg ha(-1)
   of granular PAM reduced soil erosion by 23 and 57\%, respectively,
   compared to the untreated control. We suggest that granular PAM could be
   an alternative to current post-fire erosion mitigation measures. (C)

Abstract = {{Mammalian herbivory on palatable trees affects tree growth, forest
   composition, and forest succession. Antecedent effects of herbivores can
   be identified through remnants of dead stems and altered tree morphology
   as well as changes in tree ring patterns and growth. Increases in fire
   severity, particularly surface fuel combustion, in the boreal forest of
   western North America can cause a shift in the successional trajectory
   from coniferous to deciduous dominated forests, which may alter
   plant-animal interactions. We measured height and tree ring growth of
   the two dominant canopy tree species, trembling aspen (Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), in
   sites that experienced stand-replacing fire with deep versus shallow
   surface fuel combustion 20 years ago. We also classified individual
   trees into a category of browsing damage based on external features and
   morphology. We hypothesized the effects of browsing to be contingent on
   fire severity. Using linear mixed effect models, we investigated the
   main and interactive effects of fire severity and browsing intensity on
   aspen growth. We also developed tree ring chronologies to test for
   growth releases in aspen and black spruce.
   Effects of moose browsing on aspen growth depended on fire severity
   (surface fuel combustion), with negative effects in high severity sites
   and no effects in low severity sites. Spruce growth showed no direct or
   indirect browsing effects, indicating moose have not altered the
   potential for spruce to reach the forest canopy. Aspen in severely
   burned sites showed abrupt growth releases in tree rings corresponding
   to changes in herbivore pressure and density. Height-growth projections
   indicated that moose slowed the rate of aspen growth and canopy
   dominance in severely burned areas by ten years, through repeated
   stunting of apical growth in aspen, without affecting the initial
   trajectory to an aspen-dominated canopy. Lightly burned areas, with
   their larger proportion of spruce biomass, slower aspen growth, and
   reduced browsing pressure during the first 20 years after fire, will
   likely provide accessible aspen forage until >50 years post-fire as
   sites return to spruce dominance. Heterogeneously burned forests could
   thus sustain high rates of available moose forage for a much longer
   period than previously reported. Our study highlights the importance of
   including fire severity when considering the impacts of large herbivores
   on tree growth and forest structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   a 340-km latitudinal gradient}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Questions
   The coastal heathlands of northwest Europe are classified as highly
   endangered and a habitat of high conservation importance throughout
   their geographic range. Previous research into heathland vegetation
   dynamics has typically been carried out within single sites or regions,
   and hence little is known about the variability of land-use effects and
   successional dynamics along biogeographic gradients. We test the
   hypothesis that the bioclimatic gradient is a key factor shaping
   post-fire regeneration dynamics in Calluna heathlands, with
   progressively slower regrowth and lower post-fire pioneer species
   richness towards colder climates.
   Location
   Wet and dry Calluna heath vegetation in five sites spanning a 340-km
   latitudinal gradient along the west coast of Norway (60.70 degrees-63.79
   degrees N).
   Methods
   A repeated measures design was used, with floristic data recorded from
   permanent plots in a number of experimental post-fire successionsover a
   3-yr period (n=344). The data were analysed using multivariate
   ordination techniques: detrended correspondence analysis, partial
   redundancy analysis and principal response curves, and mixed effects
   models.
   Results
   Regeneration rates decrease from south to north and the wet heath stands
   regenerate faster towards the pre-fire community composition than the
   dry stands. Calluna decreases immediately after fire in all sites, but
   increases from the second year onwards, with the southernmost site
   having the fastest return. Regeneration of grasses, herbs, mosses and
   lichens is also faster in the south. Across all sites, species richness
   decreased the first year after fire, followed by an increase that
   exceeds pre-fire levels by the second year. The number of pioneer
   species entering the heathlands after fire decreases northwards.
   Conclusions
   We found considerable geographic variation, not only in species
   composition, but also in post-fire successional trends and dynamics.
   This is probably linked to higher productivity and larger pools of
   pioneer species in southern sites, and higher growth rates of shrubs and
   mosses in the wet heath habitat. This calls for conservation of a
   geographically diverse set of heathland sites, as well as development of
   regional- and site-specific management plans.}},

Abstract = {{After decades of suppression, fire is returning to forests of the
   western United States through wildfires and prescribed burns. These
   fires may aid restoration of vegetation structure and processes, which
   could improve conditions for wildlife species and reduce severe wildfire
   risk. Understanding response of wildlife species to fires is essential
   to forest restoration because contemporary fires may not have the same
   effects as historical fires. Recent fires in the Chiricahua Mountains of
   southeastern Arizona provided opportunity to investigate long-term
   effects of burn severity on habitat selection of a native wildlife
   species. We surveyed burned forest for squirrel feeding sign and related
   vegetation characteristics to frequency of feeding sign occurrence. We
   used radio-telemetry within fire-influenced forest to determine home
   ranges of Mexican fox squirrels, Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae, and
   compared vegetation characteristics within home ranges to random areas
   available to squirrels throughout burned conifer forest. Squirrels fed
   in forest with open understory and closed canopy cover. Vegetation
   within home ranges was characterized by lower understory density,
   consistent with the effects of low-severity fire, and larger trees than
   random locations. Our results suggest that return of low-severity fire
   can help restore habitat for Mexican fox squirrels and other native
   wildlife species with similar habitat affiliations in forests with a
   historical regime of frequent, low-severity fire. Our study contributes
   to an understanding of the role and impact of fire in forest ecosystems

   Oak woodland wildlife habitat is being reduced and fragmented by human
   development. Management of oak woodlands is necessary to protect
   ecological biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and habitat quality of
   existing oak woodlands. Specific management goals include maintaining
   large, open-form oak stands with adjacent intergrading conifers,
   prairies, and wetlands; preventing habitat fragmentation; maintaining
   open to patchy understory devoid of invasive species such as Scot's
   broom; and minimizing human disturbances that could accelerate root

   old-growth trees; thinning dense understory oak and Douglas-fir to
   release remaining oaks; maintaining or developing habitat corridors to

   Understory Composition in a Mixed Conifer Forest, Sequoia National Park,
   California}},

Abstract = {{Many forests, including the mixed-conifer forest of the Sierra Nevada,
   California, historically experienced a fire regime that generated
   considerable within- and among-fire environmental variability. Fire
   suppression has resulted in a heavier, more continuous fuel bed, which
   can cause today's prescribed fires to be considerably more homogeneous.
   To evaluate the potential importance of variability in fire severity on
   post-fire plant communities, I conducted an experiment to test whether
   understory species respond differently to sites burned under a heavy
   fuel load versus sites that burned under a light fuel load. Woody fuel
   was added or removed from small forest plots in order to manipulate the
   fire severity during prescribed fire. The fuel load manipulations
   affected which species survived fire as well as which species germinated
   after fire. Seven species (Chimaphila menziesii, Chrysolepis
   sempervirens, Osmorhiza chilensis, Pyrola picta, Phacelia
   hydrophylloides, Rubus parviflorus, and Smilacina racemosa) were unable
   to survive fire in either treatment. Four species (Bromus laevipes,
   Galium sparsiflorum, Rubus glaucifolius, and Symphoricarpos mollis)
   survived more often on sites that were burned under a light fuel load.
   Several fire-stimulated species (Calystegia malacophylla, Cryptantha
   sp., Gayophytum eriospermum, Solanum xanti, Arctostaphylos patula,
   Ceanothus parvifolius, and Lotus crassifolius) germinated after fire
   regardless of fuel load, but others (Claytonia perfoliata, Ceanothus
   cordulatus, Prunus emarginata, and Ribes tularense) appeared more often
   on the light fuel treatments. Seedlings of Abies concolor germinated
   more often on the sites that burned under heavy fuel conditions. The
   varying responses of different species suggest that small-scale
   variations in fuel load may cause heterogeneous patterns of surface fire
   severity, which in turn may contribute to maintaining floral diversity
   in the mixed-conifer forest understory. In order to conserve native
   understory plant diversity, fire management efforts to restore these
   forests might consider spatial heterogeneity in fire severity as a
   management objective.}},

Abstract = {{Large fire events in southern California have burned thousands of
   hectares over the past decade. Landscape pattern and natural system
   processes are shaped by these large conflagrations, thereby influencing
   the ecological structure and functioning of the region. Unburned
   vegetation remnants can be used to assess general fuel consumption and
   to provide valuable information regarding fire behaviour, weather
   effects and post-fire regeneration. For this study, post-fire unburned
   vegetation was mapped at a very fine spatial resolution based on
   semi-automatic classification of airborne large-format multispectral
   image data and compared across different fire environment zones within
   the 2003 Cedar Fire burn perimeter. Landscape metrics were used to
   characterise unburned vegetation patches for a section of the Cedar Fire
   affected by Santa Ana weather conditions and for a section of the fire
   that burned under non-Santa Ana weather conditions. Maps of remnant
   vegetation and associated landscape metrics were compared across these
   two sections and within shrubland community type, topography and
   age-class strata using inferential statistics. Key findings reveal more
   unburned vegetation in larger, rounder patches in the non-Santa Ana

   the amount or pattern of unburned vegetation within the Santa Ana

Title = {{Evaluating the Best Spectral Indices for the Detection of Burn Scars at
   Several Post-Fire Dates in a Mountainous Region of Northwest Yunnan,

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Remote mountainous regions are among the Earth's last remaining wild
   spots, hosting rare ecosystems and rich biodiversity. Because of access
   difficulties and low population density, baseline information about
   natural and human-induced disturbances in these regions is often limited
   or nonexistent. Landsat time series offer invaluable opportunities to
   reconstruct past land cover changes. However, the applicability of this
   approach strongly depends on the availability of good quality,
   cloud-free images, acquired at a regular time interval, which in
   mountainous regions are often difficult to find. The present study
   analyzed burn scar detection capabilities of 11 widely used spectral
   indices (SI) at 1 to 5 years after fire events in four dominant
   vegetation groups in a mountainous region of northwest Yunnan, China. To
   evaluate their performances, we used M-statistic as a burned-unburned
   class separability index, and we adapted an existing metric to quantify
   the SI residual burn signal at post-fire dates compared to the maximum
   severity recorded soon after the fire. Our results show that Normalized
   Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) are
   always among the three best performers for the detection of burn scars
   starting 1 year after fire but not for the immediate post-fire
   assessment, where the Mid Infrared Burn Index, Burn Area Index, and
   Tasseled Cap Greenness were superior. Brightness and Wetness peculiar
   patterns revealed long-term effects of fire in vegetated land,
   suggesting their potential integration to assist other SI in burned area
   detection several years after the fire event. However, in general, class
   separability of most of the SI was poor after one growing season, due to
   the seasonal rains and the relatively fast regrowth rate of shrubs and
   grasses, confirming the difficulty of assessment in mountainous
   ecosystems. Our findings are meaningful for the selection of a suitable
   SI to integrate in burned area detection workflows, according to
   vegetation type and time lag between image acquisitions.}},

   Xeric Jack Pine Forests}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fire is the most common disturbance in northern boreal forests, and
   large fires are often associated with highly variable burn severities
   across the burnt area. We studied the understory plant community
   response to a range of burn severities and pre-fire stand age four
   growing seasons after the 2011 Richardson Fire in xeric jack pine
   forests of northern Alberta, Canada. Burn severity had the greatest
   impact on post-fire plant communities, while pre-fire stand age did not
   have a significant impact. Total plant species richness and cover
   decreased with disturbance severity, such that the greatest richness was
   in low severity burns (average 28 species per 1-m(2) quadrat) and plant
   cover was lowest in the high severity burns (average 16\%). However, the
   response of individual plant groups differed. Lichens and bryophytes
   were most common in low severity burns and were effectively eliminated
   from the regenerating plant community at higher burn severities. In
   contrast, graminoid cover and richness were positively related to burn
   severity, while forbs did not respond significantly to burn severity,
   but were impacted by changes in soil chemistry with increased cover at
   pH >4.9. Our results indicate the importance of non-vascular plants to
   the overall plant community in this harsh environment and that the plant
   community is environmentally limited rather than recruitment or
   competition limited, as is often the case in more mesic forest types. If
   fire frequency and severity increase as predicted, we may see a shift in
   plant communities from stress-tolerant species, such as lichens and
   ericaceous shrubs, to more colonizing species, such as certain
   graminoids.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Managing fire to achieve hazard reduction while providing for
   biodiversity conservation is complex in fire-prone regions. This
   challenge is exacerbated by limited understanding of post-fire changes
   in habitat and fuel attributes over time-scales commensurate with their
   development, and a paucity of empirical research integrating the effects
   of fire on these attributes.
   2. We used a 110-year post-fire chronosequence to investigate temporal
   development in habitat resources used by fauna, and fuels for fire in
   semi-arid Mallee vegetation, south-eastern Australia. Fire-history
   mapping previously limited investigation to 35 years post-fire. The
   patterns of temporal change over 110 years for 13 variables,
   representing key attributes of habitat and fuel, were explored using
   nonlinear mixed models and data from 549 sites.
   3. Most habitat and fuel attributes exhibited changes in abundance and
   rate of development over extended periods, emphasizing the importance of
   documenting post-fire dynamics over long time-frames. Further,
   developmental patterns were mostly nonlinear, indicating that a shorter
   temporal perspective (e.g. 20-30 years post-fire) may obscure, or
   provide an inaccurate understanding of, long-term changes.
   4. There were striking differences in the post-fire dynamics of some
   habitat and fuel attributes. Leaf litter and spinifex grass Triodia
   scariosa, which function as both habitat and fuel, increased rapidly
   after fire followed by a plateau or slow decline after 20-30 years. In
   contrast, live tree stems were not predicted to develop hollows until 40
   years, after which time the density of live hollow-bearing stems, an
   important habitat feature, increased steadily.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Fire affects the development and
   abundance of resources over substantially longer periods than can be
   examined using fire-mapping based on satellite imagery. Our results
   demonstrate that post-fire changes in mallee vegetation influence fire
   hazard and faunal habitat in different ways. Critically, the
   cover/abundance of most primary fuel sources did not increase
   substantially beyond around 30 years post-fire; whereas important
   habitat attributes changed in ways that affect faunal occurrence for
   over a century. Fire management must explicitly acknowledge the
   potential for fire to affect fauna and fuel differently, and for these
   effects to operate over time-frames that may extend well beyond current
   understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Forest-woodland-savannah mosaics are a common feature in the East
   African landscape. For the conservation of the woody species that occur
   in such landscapes, the species patterns and the factors that maintain
   it need to be understood. We studied the woody species distribution in a
   forest-woodland-savannah mosaic in Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda. The
   existing vegetation gradients were analyzed using data from a total of
   591 plots of 400 or 500 m(2) each. Remotely sensed data was used to
   explore current vegetation cover and the gradients there in for the
   whole area. A clear species gradient exists in the study area ranging
   from forest, where there is least disturbance, to wooded grassland,
   where frequent fire disturbance occurs. Most species are not limited to
   a specific part of the gradient although many show a maximum abundance
   at some point along the gradient. Fire and accessibility to the
   protected area were closely related to variation in species composition
   along the ordination axis with species like Cynometra alexandri and
   Uvariopsis congensis occurring at one end of the gradient and Combretum
   guenzi and Lonchocarpus laxiflorus at the other. The vegetation cover
   classes identified in the area differed in diversity, density and,
   especially, basal area. All vegetation cover classes, except open
   woodland, had indicator species. Diospyros abyssinica, Uvariopsis
   congensis, Holoptelea grandis and all Celtis species were the indicator
   species for the forest class, Terminalia velutina and Albizia
   grandbracteata for closed woodland, Grewia mollis and Combretum mole for
   very open woodland and Lonchocarpus laxiflorus, Grewia bicolor and
   Combretum guenzi for the wooded grassland class. Eleven of the species
   occurred in all cover classes and most of the species that occurred in
   more than one vegetation cover class showed peak abundance in a specific
   cover class. Species composition in the study area changes gradually
   from forest to savannah. Along the gradient, the cover classes are
   distinguishable in terms of species composition and vegetation
   structure. These classes are, however, interrelated in species
   composition. For conservation of the full range of the species within
   this East African landscape, the mosaic has to be managed as an
   integrated whole. Burning should be varied over the area with the forest
   not being burnt at all and the wooded grassland burnt regularly. The
   different vegetation types that occur between these two extremes should
   be maintained using a varied fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in reconstructing past disturbance regimes
   and how they influenced plant composition, structure and landscape
   pattern. Such information is useful to resource managers for determining
   the effects of fire suppression on vegetation or tailoring prescribed
   fires to restore community and landscape diversity. In the spring of
   1995, the National Park Service reintroduced landscape-scale prescribed
   fire to an extensive oak/pine woodland-savanna-glade complex on Turkey
   Mountain, Buffalo National River, Arkansas. We took advantage of this
   opportunity to: (1) reconstruct the fire history of Turkey Mountain from
   fire scars and (2) determine how plant composition, forest structure,
   and past fire intensity varied along topoedaphic gradients before the
   site was burned. A fire history was derived from wedges or
   cross-sections of one dead and eight live shortleaf pines. Woody and
   herbaceous vegetation were sampled in 18, 20 by 25-m plots
   systematically spaced along transects running upslope. The percentage of
   trees scarred was determined in 80, 20 by 20- or 20 by 40-m plots
   located along transects running upslope. Highest plant diversity
   occurred on shallow, calcareous soils (limestone glades). Lowest
   diversity was associated with deeper, acidic soils and high woody basal
   area. Vegetation composition changed gradually along environmental
   gradients, but the most distinct flora was associated with: (1)
   limestone glades, (2) deeper acid soils, (3) high basal area sites, and
   (4) sandstone glades. Savanna herbaceous species were characteristic of
   sites with intermediate soil depth and fertility. Black hickory, post
   oak, eastern red cedar, and chinquapin oak were overstory dominants.
   Encroachment of cedar (on circumneutral soils), blackjack oak, and black
   hickory (on acidic soils) may pose a serious threat to the diverse
   flora. For the 223-year fire record, the mean return interval was 5.7
   years. The longest fire-free interval was 34 years (1770-1804) and the
   shortest was 1 year. No fire scars were documented between 1972 and
   1993. The number of trees scarred per plot increased with fetch
   (distance from the bottom of the mountain), proximity to south-southwest
   slope aspects (especially on steeper slopes), and distance from the
   Buffalo River. Past variation in fire frequency and intensity may have
   acted synergistically with topoedaphic gradients to maintain a mosaic of
   plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, plant-pollinator communities are subject to a diverse array of
   perturbations and in many temperate and semi-arid systems fire is a
   dominant structuring force. We present a novel and highly integrated
   approach, which quantifies, in parallel, the response to fire of
   pollinator communities, floral communities and floral reward structure.
   Mt Carmel, Israel is a recognised bee-flower biodiversity hotspot, and
   using a chronosequence of habitats with differing post-fire ages, we
   follow the changes in plant-pollinator community organisation from
   immediately following a burn until full regeneration of vegetation.
   Initially, fire has a catastrophic effect on these communities, however,
   recovery is rapid with a peak in diversity of both flowers and bees in
   the first 2 years post-fire, followed by a steady decline over the next
   50 years. The regeneration of floral communities is closely matched by
   that of their principal pollinators. At the community level we quantify,
   per unit area of habitat, key parameters of nectar and pollen forage
   known to be of importance in structuring pollinator communities. Nectar
   Volume, nectar water content, nectar concentration and the diversity of
   nectar foraging niches are all greatest immediately following fire with
   a steady decrease as regeneration proceeds. Temporal changes in energy
   availability for nectar, pollen, total energy (nectar + pollen) and
   relative importance of pollen to nectar energy show a similar general
   decline with site age, however, the pattern is less clear owing to the
   highly patchy distribution of floral resources. Changes in floral reward
   structure reflect the general shift from annuals (generally low-reward
   open access flowers) to perennials (mostly high-reward and restricted
   access flowers) as post-fire regeneration ensues. The impact of fire on
   floral communities and their associated rewards have clear implications
   for pollinator community structure and we discuss this and the role of
   other disturbance factors on these systems.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that influence vegetation responses to
   disturbance is important because vegetation is the foundation of food
   resources, wildlife habitat, and ecosystem properties and processes. We
   integrated vegetation cover data derived from field plots and remotely
   sensed Landsat images in two focal areas over a 37-yr period (1979-2016)
   to investigate how historical changes to community composition influence
   contemporary responses of vegetation to fire in sagebrush ecosystems in
   the Great Basin. Our objectives were (1) to quantify the magnitude and
   direction of change in the cover of native and exotic plant functional
   groups in relation to their exposure to fire; (2) to relate plant
   community changes to their historical composition, exposure to fire, and
   environmental conditions; and (3) to test for consistency of trends
   revealed by vegetation cover data derived from field plots and Landsat
   images. Historical (1979-1981) field data originated from 298 locations,
   Landsat-derived data and contemporary (2011-2016) field data originated
   from 448 locations, and an expanded set of locations were included in
   some analyses of Landsat-derived data. We found that areas burned by
   fire since the 1980s had higher annual herbaceous cover than unburned
   areas both historically and contemporarily. Models revealed a
   significant interaction between historical community composition and
   exposure to fire, which suggests that plots with historically high
   herbaceous cover were more susceptible to burning. Trends revealed by
   field and Landsat-derived cover data were only partially consistent,
   potentially due in part to methods used to predict cover values from
   Landsat images, and the time period over which each data set was
   collected. Our results suggest that burned areas historically occupied
   by sagebrush-dominated plant communities may have been invaded by exotic
   annuals prior to burning, possibly because of prior land uses, and after
   burning, have now transitioned to a persistent herbaceous-dominated
   state. This type of state transition has important consequences for
   forage quality, wildlife habitat, soil nutrients, and future
   disturbances, such as drought and wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological stoichiometry may be used to investigate the impacts of fire
   regime, as fire regime can influence the cycling and balance of elements
   within forest ecosystems. We investigated the effects of fire history on
   soil and litter stoichiometry in four forest sites in Queensland,

   those in areas with no recent fire. Effects of burning on concentrations
   and ratios of multiple pools of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
   (P) in soil varied between sites, indicating that site and fire regime
   characteristics regulate these responses. Labile pools of soil C, N and
   P were more responsive to burning than total pools, and labile soil C :
   P and N: P ratios tended to be lower in recently burned areas,
   consistent with our expectations. These changes suggest that the
   disparate volatilisation temperatures of these elements influence
   post-fire soil stoichiometry, and that P cycling may be enhanced in some
   post-fire environments. Fire-induced changes to litter chemistry were
   not consistent with soil effects, although litter was generally

   and fire severity}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{415}},
Pages = {{85-97}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Setting suitable conservation targets is an important part of ecological
   fire planning. Growth-stage optimisation (GSO) determines the relative
   proportions of post-fire growth stages (categorical representations of
   time since fire) that maximise species diversity, and is a useful method
   for determining such targets. Optimisation methods can accommodate
   various predictor variables, but to date have only been applied using
   post-fire growth stages as the primary landscape variable. However,
   other aspects of fire regimes such as severity may influence species
   diversity but have not yet been considered in determining conservation
   targets in fire planning. Here we use a space-for-time substitution to
   address two objectives, 1. To determine the effects of growth stage and
   fire severity on plant and vertebrate species' occurrence, and 2. To
   determine the optimal mix of growth stages and fire seventies for
   sustaining the diversity of these groups. We used the tall wet forests
   of southeast Australia as the focal system because fire severity is
   expected to create distinct successional pathways and influence species'
   responses. We found that growth stage predicted the occurrence of many
   species, and severity of the most recent fire was an important factor
   over and above growth stage for a small subset of species. The optimal
   distribution of growth stages for both plants and animals included a
   substantial proportion of young forest, however when fire severity was
   considered, areas burned at low severity were most important in driving
   the diversity of both groups. Growth stage is a good surrogate for
   developing conservation targets in tall wet forests, however growth
   stage alone does not capture the full range of species' fire responses.
   More complex versions of growth stage optimisation that accommodate
   multiple fire-regime variables need to be explored to yield ecologically
   meaningful conservation goals.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{670-678}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Management of rangelands has largely operated under the paradigm of
   minimizing spatially discrete disturbances, often under the objective of
   reducing inherent heterogeneity within managed ecosystems. This has led
   to a simplified understanding of rangelands and in many cases simplified
   rangelands. We argue that this type of management focus is incapable of
   maintaining biodiversity. An evolutionary model of disturbance
   (pyric-herbivory) suggests that grazing and fire interact through a
   series of feedbacks to cause a shifting mosaic of vegetation patterns
   across the landscape and has potential to serve as a model for
   management of grasslands with an evolutionary history of grazing. Our
   study demonstrates that the spatially controlled interaction of fire and
   grazing can be used to create heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems and
   the resulting heterogeneity in vegetation is expressed through other
   trophic levels, specifically small mammals in this study. Discrete fires
   were applied to patches, and patchy grazing by herbivores promoted a
   shifting vegetation mosaic across the landscape that created unique
   habitat structures for various small mammal species. Peromyscus
   maniculatus was about 10 times more abundant on recently burned patches
   (1-2 mo) than the uniform treatment or unburned patches within the
   shifting mosaic treatment. Chaetodipus hispidus was about 10 times
   greater in patches that were 15-20 mu post-fire in the shifting mosaic
   treatment than in the uniform treatment. Sigmodon hispidus, Microtus
   ochrogaster, and Reithrodontomys fluvescens became dominant in the
   shifting mosaic in patches that were more than 2 yr post-fire. This
   study, along with others, suggests that by managing transient focal
   patches, heterogeneity has the potential to be a new central paradigm
   for conservation of rangeland ecosystems and can enhance biological
   diversity and maintain livestock production across broad scales.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a model of `premature tree decline' whereby an absence of

   model is relevant to some temperate Australian forests in which fire
   regimes have shifted from relatively frequent before European settlement
   to infrequent following settlement. The increased development of
   midstorey vegetation and litter accumulation has occurred since European
   settlement in some specific examples of Australian forests and
   woodlands. Our model proposes that in the long absence of fire: 1.
   midstorey vegetation reduces the availability of soil water for
   eucalypts and; 2. Eucalypts have less access to P and/or cations as
   these elements become locked up in soil, litter and midstorey biomass.
   We highlight important knowledge gaps and argue that research into

Abstract = {{At fine spatial scales (0.1 - 10 m), chaparral communities have been
   shown to be strongly influenced by canopy-gap patterns, leading to
   periodicities in vegetation at 4 - 5 m spatial scales. Fine-scale
   variations in fire behavior and post-fire erosion can lead to changes in
   the patterning of viable seeds and nutrients and may alter the spatial
   patterning of post-fire chaparral communities. This study deals with the
   relationship among fire behavior, post-fire nutrient availabilities and
   vegetation patterns in a 1-yr old, post-fire Adenostoma fasciculatum
   chaparral community in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA.
   Variations in mineral soil exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg) and extractable
   phosphorus (PO4-P) were correlated with ash distribution. Cations and
   measures of ammonium and nitrate were also correlated with fire
   intensity, measured by the diameter of the smallest remaining A.
   fasciculatum twigs following fire. Fire intensity was correlated with
   the pattern of post-fire vegetation establishment based on first axis
   DCA scores. However, ash PO4-P was more highly correlated with sample
   DCA scores, local species richness and total cover (p < 0.01),
   suggesting that small-scale variations in PO4-P which correlate with ash
   distributions may be important in structuring this community.
   Two- and three-term local variance analysis revealed a maximum of
   pattern intensity in DCA first axis scores at 4 - 5 m intervals that
   likely corresponds to pre-fire canopy-gap patterns. However, total cover
   showed pattern at spatial scales of 8 - 10 m, and was correlated at this
   scale with patterns of ash distribution and fire intensity.
   Microtopographic patterns also occur at similar spatial scales.
   Microtopographic patterns appear important in determining post-fire
   plant nutrient and water distributions and, thereby, patterns of plant
   establishment. Thus, the scale and intensity of post-fire vegetation
   pattern may differ considerably from pre-fire conditions.}},

   There, a large proportion of timber is harvested in forests susceptible
   of accumulating a thick Sphagnum layer that decreases forest
   productivity, a process called paludification. In such a context,
   understanding how disturbance type and severity of soil disturbances may
   affect post-disturbance microhabitat characteristics and understory
   community composition is critical for forest management. Different
   management techniques have been used such as careful logging and
   clearcutting, as well as winter and summer harvests, with various
   impacts on soils and forest regeneration. In the current study, we used
   55 study sites representing a gradient of soil disturbance severity by
   harvesting (winter and summer) and fire (low and high severity) to
   compare their impacts on understory plant communities in the Clay Belt
   area of eastern Canada. At each site, understory community composition
   (vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens) was assessed. We found a
   strong response of communities to overall severity as represented by
   disturbance type (careful logging, clearcutting, and fire), but little
   impact of fine scale disturbance severity (winter vs. summer, low vs.
   high severity disturbance) within each type of disturbance. Differences
   in community composition were reflected in the abundance of the various
   plant functional types, with invaders being more common in harvested
   sites, endurers being common in all disturbances except high severity
   fires, and avoiders being more common in older sites. Understory
   communities in harvested sites (< 40 years old) were similar to
   communities typical of old sites originating from natural wildfire
   disturbances (75-100 years old low severity fires or 200 years old high
   severity fires) in terms of composition, but also Sphagnum spp.
   abundance. In order to maintain long-term forest productivity and manage
   forests in ways that more closely reproduce post-fire conditions,
   logging operations should aim at increasing soil disturbances, for
   example by using prescribed burns, in the Clay Belt area of eastern
   North America.}},

Abstract = {{The chaparral-dominated national forests of southern California were in
   part established to provide water provision services to the surrounding
   urban populations and irrigation for agriculture. However, water
   provision in the form of groundwater recharge and surface runoff depends
   on the climatological conditions of any given year and also
   landscape-scale disturbances such as fire. Fire is increasing in
   frequency in southern California and understanding its impacts both
   immediately post-fire and as vegetation recovers, and the interactions
   between fire and hydrology, are key components to managing federal lands
   effectively. In this study we focus on nine fires in a study area that
   encompasses the four southern California national forests (Los Padres,
   Angeles, San Bernardino, and Cleveland) and use a water balance model to
   investigate the effects of water provision services post-fire at a
   regional scale. We found that runoff and recharge increased post-fire,
   with increases in recharge being greater with recovery times ranging
   from 2 to 4 y post-fire. Vegetation recovery occurred 2 y post-fire for
   all basins as indicated by remotely sensed imagery measuring vegetation
   greenness having returned to or exceeded pm-fire values for the basin.
   We found that runoff and recharge were more sensitive to the effects of
   climate than to length of time post-fire. Findings from these modeling
   tools allow users to anticipate the impact of fire on water provision
   services in the region and develop management strategies that help
   reduce the impacts of wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological integrity of the Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia
   tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and A. Young) alliance is
   being severely interrupted by post-fire invasion of non-native annual
   grasses. To curtail this invasion, successful post-fire revegetation of
   perennial grasses is required. Environmental factors impacting post-fire
   restoration success vary across space within the Wyoming big sagebrush
   alliance; however, most restorative management practices are applied
   uniformly. Our objectives were to define probability of revegetation
   success over space using relevant soil-related environmental factors,
   use this information to model cost of successful revegetation and
   compare the importance of vegetation competition and soil factors to
   revegetation success. We studied a burned Wyoming big sagebrush
   landscape in southeast Oregon that was reseeded with perennial grasses.
   We collected soil and vegetation data at plots spaced at 30 m intervals
   along a 1.5 km transect in the first two years post-burn. Plots were
   classified as successful (> 5 seedlings/m(2)) or unsuccessful based on
   density of seeded species. Using logistic regression we found that
   abundance of competing vegetation correctly predicted revegetation
   success on 51 \% of plots, and soil-related variables correctly
   predicted revegetation performance on 82.4 \% of plots. Revegetation
   estimates varied from \$167.06 to \$43,033.94/ha across the 1.5 km
   transect based on probability of success, but were more homogenous at
   larger scales. Our experimental protocol provides managers with a
   technique to identify important environmental drivers of restoration
   success and this process will be of value for spatially allocating
   logistical and capital expenditures in a variable restoration
   environment.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Plant dispersal and colonisation are important processes in vegetation
   recovery after fire and, for several species, depend on the presence of
   frugivorous avian seed dispersers. In burned and salvage-logged
   Mediterranean pine forests, the occurrence of disperser birds is
   enhanced by the presence of wood debris piles built as erosion barriers,
   which become seed dispersal foci. We hypothesised that the distribution
   of bird-dispersed plants after fire could be determined by the presence
   of wood piles. We analysed the differences in species richness and
   overall cover of bird-dispersed plants, as well as the cover of the most
   common species, within piles and outside them. We also tested if
   micro-environmental conditions (slope orientation and pile size) might
   influence plant occurrence. We found more species and overall cover
   within piles, when located on southern and south-eastern slopes, than
   outside them. Moreover, taller piles showed higher values of
   bird-dispersed plant cover and richness. Therefore, wood piles may
   provide the necessary conditions for bird-dispersed plant recruitment in
   dry burned areas. To our knowledge, this is the first reported man-made
   structure that clearly benefits the recovery of bird-dispersed plants in
   burned areas, and suggests that piles may be a useful restoration
   measure when logging Mediterranean burned forests.}},

Abstract = {{In the summer of 2010, about half of the Kerzhensky State Nature
   Biosphere Reserve territory (total area is 467.9 km(2)) suffered from a
   wildfire. During the seven following years, monitoring of the
   terrestrial vertebrate populations was conducted there. In total, six
   amphibian species, six reptile species, 142 bird species, and 20 small
   mammal species were registered. The particular wildfire impact on
   different vertebrate species was dissimilar. In the first year after the
   wildfire impact, bird populations in the habitats affected by different
   wildfire types were similar according to the Sorensen-Chekanovsky's
   index. This similarity increased over time. The species richness changed
   in different directions. At first study years, the abundance of the
   nesting bird populations increased both in burnt and unburnt sites,
   while later this parameter decreased a bit and stabilised. The bird
   populations of the unburnt habitats differ by lower indicators for the
   last five years. We distinguished the species (e.g. Sylvia communis)
   recognised as indicators of damaging by fire. These are birds which
   became abundant in the burnt forest, but were very rarely dominant and
   less abundant in unburnt forest. Fringilla coelebs was dominant in all
   habitats studied. For the small mammal communities, the wildfire
   influence affected a decrease (by 2-3 times) in the abundance and
   biodiversity indexes, and a change of dominants (from Clethrionomys
   glareolus to Apodemus flavicollis). ANOVA showed that the fires with a
   high degree of reliability (0.445; p-level < 1) had a higher impact on
   the small mammal communities. In amphibians and reptiles, the wildfire
   caused only a decrease in abundance followed by subsequent recovery
   without changes in community composition. The most intense post-fire
   changes in terrestrial vertebrate (Tetrapoda) populations were observed
   within the first five post-fire years. The amphibian and the reptile
   populations recovered after three post-fire years, while the recovery of
   bird and small mammal communities noted 4-5 years after the fire.}},

   Neotropical moist forest, savanna and seasonally dry tropical forest are

Abstract = {{In the Republic of Korea, forest fire occurred at a rate of more than
   400 events yr(-1)from 2000 to 2016, and the burned areas are
   concentrated in the eastern coastal region. In this region, pine forest
   is extensively distributed, and pine forest is converted to oak forest
   through natural succession or stump-sprout regeneration following forest
   fires. However, there is a lack of research on oak competition and
   survival during the regeneration process in burned areas. Therefore,
   this research was carried out to evaluate the effects of oak survival
   ratio ofQuercus serrata(glandbearing oak),Q. variabilis(oriental oak),
   andQ. mongolica(Mongolian oak) in burned areas. The investigation plots
   were set to survey tree height, diameter at breast height, sprout
   survival, and composition in Goseong-gun, Kangwon province, Republic of
   Korea. The mean tree heights ofQ. serrataandQ. variabiliswere
   approximately 9.8 m and 9.1 m, respectively, which were higher than the
   approximately 5.8 m heights ofQ. mongolicastands 18 years after a forest
   fire, and the trend for tree diameter at breast height was the same for
   all three species stands. In the early stage of regeneration after the
   forest fire, the survival probability of theQ. serratasprouts decreased
   at a rate of 1.7-2.0 times higher than that of other oak species in
   theQ. serrata-dominant stands, and this tendency was found to the
   survival probability inQ. variabilis-dominant stands as well. The median
   survival time ofQ. variabilissprouts in theQ. variabilis-dominant stands
   was approximately 10.1 years, which was similar toQ. serrata-dominant
   stands. However, the dominant stand ofQ. mongolicawas different from
   that of other dominant stands since the stand mostly located in the
   ridge and the upper part of the mountain where topography and soil
   conditions were considerably dissimilar from the other stands. The
   decision of dominant species seems to be determined by the survival and
   occurrence of sprouts during the early stage in post-fire regenerated
   oak forests. Therefore, it would be more desirable to coppice sprout for
   dominant species productivity and rapid dominance after a forest fire.}},

Title = {{Variable retention harvesting in Victoria's Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus
   regnans) forests (southeastern Australia)}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Variable retention harvesting is a silvicultural system that focuses on
   retaining key elements of stand structure at the time of logging and is
   increasingly being used worldwide. We describe the design and
   establishment of a variable retention harvesting experiment established
   in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central
   Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The experiment was
   instigated in 2003, and the work to date has shown that it has
   environmental benefits for certain groups of small mammals, birds, and
   vascular plants. The experiment has been integrated with an ongoing
   long-term monitoring program as well as other experiments such as those
   in post-fire salvage-logged areas. Collectively, the results of various
   studies suggest that the potential value of variable retention
   harvesting extends beyond green-tree logging to post-fire salvage
   logging environments. We outline some of the challenges in, and new
   perspectives derived from, implementing and maintaining our experiment.
   This included difficulties protecting islands from high-intensity
   post-harvest regeneration burns and threat of declining funding
   undermining ongoing project viability. A critically important
   perspective concerns the ecological and economic context in which
   variable retention harvesting is implemented. In the particular case of
   Mountain Ash forests, assessments using formal IUCN criteria classify
   the ecosystem as being Critically Endangered under the Red Listed
   Ecosystem approach. As a result, Mountain Ash forests are at a high risk
   of ecosystem collapse. Further logging will increase that risk, making
   the basis for continued harvesting questionable. In addition, economic
   analyses suggest that the value of natural assets, like water
   production, far outweigh the value of the wood products harvested from
   the Mountain Ash ecosystem, again leading to questions about the
   viability of ongoing harvesting. We therefore conclude that whilst
   variable retention harvesting has the potential to contribute to
   biodiversity conservation in Mountain Ash forests, broader ecological
   and economic contextual issues (such as the values of competing
   resources like water yields and the heavily degraded state of the
   forest) may erode the case for its broader application.}},

Title = {{Modeling potential erosion due to the Cerro Grande Fire with a GIS-based

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-100}},
Abstract = {{Erosional processes directly influenced by wildland fire include
   reduction or elimination of above-ground biomass, reduction of soil
   organic matter, and hydrophobicity. High fuel loads promoted by decades
   of fire suppression in the U. S. increase the duration and intensity of
   burning, amplifying these effects. The Cerro Grande fire (6-31 May 2000)
   consumed approximately 15 000 hectares around and within the town of Los
   Alamos, New Mexico, USA. Private and public infrastructure including Los
   Alamos National Laboratory are at continuing risk due to increased
   threats of upstream erosion. We use a geographic information system
   (GIS) based implementation of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation
   (RUSLE) to model pre- and post-fire soil loss conditions and aid erosion
   risk analysis. Pre- and post-fire vegetation cover data layers were
   generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper
   (ETM) data. Based upon annual average rainfall amounts we estimate that
   subwatershed average pre- fire erosion rates range from 0.45 to 9.22
   tonnes ha(-1) yr(-1) while post-fire erosion rates before watershed
   treatments range from 1.72 to 113.26 tonnes ha(-1) yr(-1). Rates are
   approximately 3.7 times larger for 50 year return interval rainfall
   amounts. It is estimated that watershed treatments including reseeding
   will decrease soil loss between 0.34 and 25.98\% in the first year on
   treated subwatersheds. Immediately after the fire an interagency Burned
   Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) team produced initial estimates of
   soil erosion. Our estimates of average erosion rates by subwatershed
   were in general larger than those initial estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fire is a common disturbance factor, especially in boreal

   approach for the detection and monitoring. The results indicated that
   the forest under natural regeneration achieved a totally different

Abstract = {{Few studies have attempted to isolate the various factors that may cause
   the observed increases in peak flows and erosion after high-severity
   wildfires. This study evaluated the effects of burning by: (i) comparing
   soil water repellency, surface cover, and sediment yields from severely
   burned hillslopes, unburned hillslopes, and hillslopes where the surface
   cover was removed by raking; and (ii) conducting rainfall simulations to
   compare runoff, erosion, and surface sealing from two soils with varying
   ash cover. The fire-enhanced soil water repellency was only stronger on
   the burned hillslopes than the unburned hillslopes in the first summer
   after burning. For the first 5 yr after burning, the mean sediment yield
   from the burned hillslopes was 32 Mg ha(-1), whereas the unburned
   hillslopes generated almost no sediment. Sediment yields from the raked
   and burned hillslopes were indistinguishable when they had comparable
   surface cover, rainfall erosivity, and soil water repellency values. The
   rainfall simulations on ash-covered plots generated only 21 to 49\% as
   much runoff and 42 to 67\% as much sediment as the plots with no ash
   cover. Soil thin sections showed that the bare plots rapidly developed a
   structural soil seal. Successive simulations quickly eroded the ash
   cover and increased runoff and sediment yields to the levels observed
   from the bare plots. The results indicate that: (i) post-fire sediment
   yields were primarily due to the loss of surface cover rather than
   fire-enhanced soil water repellency; (ii) surface cover is important
   because it inhibits soil sealing; and (iii) ash temporarily prevents
   soil sealing and reduces post-fire runoff and sediment yields.}},

Abstract = {{Southern boreal forests dominated by trembling aspen (Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) are notable for the biological richness of their
   plant communities. We used 12 plant community and plant functional group
   indicators to test the hypothesis that natural dynamics-based
   silvicultural systems better maintain biodiversity in aspen plant
   communities than conventional clear-cutting. Using CA ordination,
   box-and-whisker diagrams, and ANOVA, we compared the range of
   variability of our 12 bioindicators among five experimental stand types
   of the sylviculture et management forestier ecosystemiques (SAFE)
   project: mature (78 years) uncut; mature 1/3 partial-cut; mature 2/3
   partial-cut; young (3 years) unburned clear-cut; young burned clear-cut;
   and three closely matched aspen stand types of northwest Quebec and
   northeast Ontario: old (105 years) uncut; young unburned clear-cut;
   young wildfire. Burned clearcuts partially emulated wildfires by
   reducing tall shrub abundance and regenerating post-fire specialists,
   but snags were lacking. The dual disturbance also retarded aspen
   regrowth and caused a 7-fold increase in non-native plants. Partial-cuts
   retained most attributes of mature uncut stands, but after 3 years
   showed little evidence of accelerating development of old stand
   characteristics. We concluded that SAFE natural dynamics-based
   silviculture better recreated the range of variability of naturally
   disturbed aspen plant communities than conventional clear-cutting.
   Improvements, including alternative burn prescriptions and snag or green
   tree retention in clearcuts, are nontheless warranted.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are the principal disturbance in the boreal forest, and their
   size and frequency are increasing as the climate warms. Impacts of fires
   on boreal wildlife are largely unknown, especially for the tens of
   millions of waterfowl that breed in the region. This knowledge gap
   creates significant barriers to the integrative management of fires and
   waterfowl, leading to fire policies that largely disregard waterfowl.
   Waterfowl populations across the western boreal forest of North America
   have been monitored annually since 1955 by the Waterfowl Breeding
   Population and Habitat Survey (BPOP), widely considered the most
   extensive wildlife survey in the world. Using these data, we examined
   impacts of forest fires on abundance of two waterfowl guilds - dabblers
   and divers. We modelled waterfowl abundance in relation to fire extent
   (i.e. amount of survey transect burned) and time since fire, examining
   both immediate and lagged fire impacts. From 1955 to 2014, >1100 fires
   in the western boreal forest intersected BPOP survey transects, and many
   transects burned multiple times. Nonetheless, fires had no detectable
   impact on waterfowl abundance; annual transect counts of dabbler and
   diver pairs remained stable from the pre- to post-fire period. The
   absence of fire impacts on waterfowl abundance extended from the years
   immediately following the fire to those more than a decade afterwards.
   Likewise, the amount of transect burned did not influence waterfowl
   abundance, with similar pair counts from the pre- to post-fire period
   for small (1-20\% burned), medium (21-60\%) and large (>60\%)
   burns.Policy implications. Waterfowl populations appear largely
   resilient to forest fires, providing initial evidence that current
   policies of limited fire suppression, which predominate throughout much
   of the boreal forest, have not been detrimental to waterfowl
   populations. Likewise, fire-related management actions, such as
   prescribed burning or targeted suppression, seem to have limited impacts
   on waterfowl abundance and productivity. For waterfowl managers, our
   results suggest that adaptive models of waterfowl harvest, which
   annually guide hunting quotas, do not need to emphasize fires when
   integrating climate change effects.

Abstract = {{Temperate grassy woodlands were once widespread and dominant in many
   agricultural regions of southeastern Australia. Most are now highly
   degraded and fragmented and exist within a context of broadscale
   landscape degradation. Greater understanding of natural processes in
   these woodlands is needed to benchmark management and restoration
   efforts that are now critical for their ongoing survival. We studied
   physical and chemical properties of topsoils from rare, little-grazed
   remnants of grassy Eucalyptus albens Benth. and E. melliodora Cunn. ex
   Schauer woodlands in central New South Wales and examined natural
   patterns in topsoil properties and understorey flora in relation to
   trees and canopy gaps. Topsoils were generally low in available
   macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur), but were favourable
   for plant growth in most other measured characteristics. Topsoils
   beneath trees were notably more fertile than in open areas, particularly
   in total carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, available
   potassium and salinity. Higher nutrient concentrations, particularly of
   available phosphorus, may have contributed to patterns in understorey
   dominants, with Themeda australis (R. Br.) Stapf predominating in open
   areas and Poa sieberiana Spreng. beneath trees. Trees were also
   associated with a higher native-plant richness, possibly resulting from
   their influence on the competitive dynamics of the dominant grasses. We
   discuss the implications of these interactions for the use of burning,
   grazing and slashing in woodland management and re-establishment of
   native grasses and trees in restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The world's forests are highly fragmented by linear disturbances, and
   many forests have failed to recover decades after abandonment. Lack of
   recovery is common in unproductive forests, such as treed peatlands,
   because of conditions that limit tree growth, including simplification
   of microtopography (loss of microsites). The persistence of these
   features affects biodiversity, but of particular concern in Canada is
   the detrimental effects on threatened woodland caribou. Although natural
   regeneration of trees in peatlands occurs in some places, it is not an
   effective recovery strategy for restoring the habitat of woodland
   caribou. This has led to restoration activities with costs exceeding
   CAD\$12 500/km. However, current restoration does not consider
   wildfires, which can destroy planted trees but also initiate early seral
   conditions that favor natural regeneration. Here we compared tree
   regeneration on seismic lines and adjacent forest controls for burnt (75
   sites) and unburnt (68 sites) treed peatlands in northeast Alberta,
   Canada. Tree regeneration (stems with a DBH < 1 cm/ha) varied from 28
   500 in burnt lines, 11 440 in unburnt lines, and 18 210 in burnt forest,
   to 9520 in unburnt forest. Wildfires promoted denser regeneration in
   sites with a greater proportion of serotinous species and water table
   depth. Microtopography and terrain wetness explained regeneration on
   burnt lines, but not unburnt lines. In burnt and unburnt lines,
   sunlight, microtopography, and depth of water table most affected tree
   regeneration patterns.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed plant community succession following prescribed fire on
   ungrazed Wyoming big sagebrush steppe, eastern Oregon. Treatments were
   burned (Burn; September and October, 2002) and unburned (Control)
   sagebrush steppe. Herbaceous yield, vegetation canopy cover and density
   were compared between treatments after fire (2003-18). Herbaceous yield
   in the Burn treatment was about double the Control for most of the study
   period. Prior to fire, native perennials comprised 90-95\% of herbaceous
   yield. After fire, native perennials represented 78\% (range 67-93\%)
   and exotic annuals 22\% (range 7-33\%) of total yield. Exotic annuals
   increased after fire and responded in two stages. In the first 8 years
   after fire, desert alyssum dominated the annual plant composition. In
   the last half of the study, cheatgrass co-dominated the annual component
   with alyssum. Sagebrush recovery was slow and we estimated sagebrush
   cover would return to pre-burn levels, at the earliest, in 115 years.
   Burning Wyoming big sagebrush steppe would be detrimental to
   sagebrush-obligate wildlife for an extended time period, because of lost
   cover and structure provided by sagebrush. The additional forage
   provided on burned areas may give livestock manager's greater
   flexibility to rest or defer unburned habitat for wildlife species of

   Stomach analyses indicated that invertebrate consumption increased after

   Calomys expulsus, consumed more invertebrates in the burned areas than
   Necromys lasiurus or Cerradomys scotti. These Calomys rodents were also

Abstract = {{In this study we document a post-fire erosion response to a short-lived,
   intense rainstorm occurred on 6 September 2012 in the Sant'Angelo creek
   watershed, Sarno Mountains, Southern Italy. The rainstorm occurred one
   month after a wildfire that burned about 11 ha of the steep watershed
   (55 ha), almost entirely mantled by volcaniclastic deposits. The
   research was based on fieldwork and laboratory analysis addressed to the
   understanding of the geomorphic effects of the wildfire and their impact
   on erosional and depositional processes triggered by subsequent
   rainstorms. Field evidence indicates that a series of overland flows
   caused significant runoff and sediment yields along the hillslope and
   accumulation of hyperconcentrated flow deposits in a concrete channel
   occluded by a sealed culvert at the outlet of the watershed. The results
   of geomorphological and sedimentological analysis suggest that the
   occurrence of volcaniclastic covers mantling the slopes likely favored
   accelerated soil erosion, especially where vegetation and litter had
   been removed by the fire. Chemical analysis on sediment samples,
   revealed the occurrence of iron oxides that enhanced soil water
   repellency conditions over wide areas of the burned watershed compared
   to the unburned areas. Quantitative analysis of sediment budgets showed
   that the rainfall-induced erosion response at Sant'Angelo creek
   watershed resulted in a soil loss of 19.8-33.1 tons ha(-1) over bumed
   areas. Post-fire erosion response following severe rainstorms needs to
   be considered in the spectrum of natural hazards associated with the
   geomorphological evolution of mountainous landscapes mantled by
   volcaniclastic deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Fire suppression has altered the uplands of northern Mississippi
   (U.S.A.). Once blanketed by open oak woodlands, this region is now
   experiencing mesophytic tree invasion, canopy closure, reduced oak
   regeneration, and herbaceous understory loss. In an attempt to
   reestablish historical conditions, experimental restoration was
   initiated through thinning and burning treatments. Our study, part of a
   comprehensive monitoring effort, is the first to examine the impact of
   oak woodland restoration on the spider community and associated habitat
   structure. Samples measuring a variety of environmental variables and
   utilizing an array of spider collecting techniques were taken within
   four habitats located at the restoration site: fire-suppressed forest,
   moderately treated forest, intensely treated forest, and old field. Two
   main conclusions resulted from this study. (1) Open-habitat specialists
   responded positively to increased canopy openness regardless of the
   availability of herbaceous vegetation. (2) Woodland restoration
   increased spider diversity, perhaps through the formation of diverse
   habitat structure and/or by altering species dominance patterns. A rise
   in open-habitat specialist diversity was observed as treatment intensity
   increased, with no compensatory reduction in the diversity of forest
   specialists. What remains to be seen is whether the continued transition
   to open woodland habitat will result in losses of forest specialist
   species. More aggressive overstory tree thinning is currently being
   administered to encourage the growth of herbaceous grasses and forbs,
   which will permit future tests of a hypothesized decline in forest
   specialists.}},

Abstract = {{Population age structure and succession were investigated in subalpine
   forests in the Colorado Front Range dominated by Pinus flexilis (limber
   pine).  Age, size, and spatial data were collected from three recent
   burns (< 100 yr old), six ca. 240 year-old post-fire stands, and two
   old-growth stands (individuals > 400 yr old).  The sequence of
   colonization of now extant trees on these post-fire sites appeared to be
   consistent:  first Pinus flexilis, then Picea engelmannii (Engelmann
   spruce), and later Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir) with a delay between
   the first Pinus flexilis and Abies of as long as 140 yr.  The advantage
   of Pinus flexilis on post-burn sites can be attributed to avian seed
   dispersal and the exceptional drought tolerance of its seedlings.  The
   three recent burns were not extensive, and the delay in establishment of
   Picea and Abies appeared to be limited by harsh site conditions rather
   than lack of seed dispersal.
   Spatial analysis indicated a consistent, although sometimes weak,
   attraction between Pinus flexilis and Picea and Pinus flexilis and Abies
   at a scale of 1-4 m, suggesting that Pinus flexilis may facilitate
   establishment of Picea and Abies seedlings by providing shade or
   protection from wind.  On xeric to slightly xeric sites, Pinus flexilis
   appeared to form broadly even-aged, non-regenerating populations that
   were gradually being replaced by Picea and Abies.  Replacement is
   proceeding at a faster rate on the least xeric sites (north aspects,
   valley bottoms) compared to the most xeric sites (south aspects).  On
   the most extreme sites, Pinus flexilis formed all-aged, self-maintaining
   populations with no evidence of replacement by Picea and Abies.  In
   these old-growth forests with occasional trees aged at > 1300 yr,
   recruitment is continuous or episodic.}},

Abstract = {{Erica australis heathlands in Leon province (NW Spain) have high
   resilience to disturbances and their post-fire recovery is very fast.
   The risk of soil erosion is high in the first few months after fire. The
   aim of this study is to investigate the effects on post-fire succession
   of sowing grass (Agrostis capillaris and Festuca rubra) and legume
   (Lotus corniculatus) seeds in a heathland burned by a summer wildfire,
   and to determine the most suitable native herbaceous species combination
   for protecting the soil in the first few phases of recovery. Fifteen
   permanent 4 m(2) plots are established in the burned area; four
   treatments and a control (unsown) are applied, each with three
   replicates. Three similar unburned plots are also considered (unburned
   control). Total cover is significantly higher in the sown plots in
   relation to the control in the first few months after sowing. but there
   are no differences after 18 months. Lotus corniculatus appears only in
   the first year and has no effect on the total cover. E rubra appears
   earlier than Agrostis capillaris, but decreases significantly in cover
   after 18 months. Shrub species have the highest cover in the control
   plots and the lowest in the Agrostis plots. The correspondence analysis
   shows that the trend for vegetation in all plots reaches similar species
   composition by the time of final sampling. The last sampling of sown
   plots shows greater similarity to the control plots than the sampling of
   these plots within the first year. The fast initial growth of F rubra,
   together with its decrease and subsequent low cover from the second
   year, make it more preferable than Agrostis capillaris for purposes of
   soil protection. However, additional research, both species- and
   site-specific, is necessary, as different responses due to different
   post-fire conditions and pre-fire species composition can have important
   implications on community dynamics. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used throughout fire-prone landscapes to conserve
   biodiversity. Current best practice in managing savanna systems
   advocates methods based on the assumption that increased fire-mediated
   landscape heterogeneity (pyrodiversity) will promote biodiversity.
   However, considerable knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of how
   savanna wildlife responds to the composition and configuration of
   pyrodiverse landscapes. The effects of pyrodiversity on functional
   diversity have rarely been quantified and assessing this relationship at
   a landscape scale that is commensurate with fire management is important
   for understanding mechanisms underlying ecosystem resilience. Here, we
   assess the impact of spatiotemporal variation in a long-term fire regime
   on avian diversity in North West Province, South Africa. We examined the
   relationship between (1) species richness, (2) three indices of
   functional diversity (i.e., functional richness, functional evenness,
   and functional dispersion) and four measures of pyrodiversity, the
   spatial extents of fire age classes, and habitat type at the landscape
   scale. We then used null models to assess differences between observed
   and expected functional diversity. We found that the proportion of newly
   burned (<1-yr post-fire), old, unburned (>= 10 yr post-fire), and
   woodland habitat on the landscape predicted species and functional
   richness. Species richness also increased with the degree of edge
   contrast between patches of varying fire age, while functional
   dispersion increased with the degree of patch shape complexity. Lower
   than expected levels of functional richness suggest that habitat
   filtering is occurring, resulting in functional redundancy across our
   study sites. We demonstrate that evaluating functional diversity and
   redundancy is an important component of conservation planning as they
   may contribute to previously reported fire resilience. Our findings
   suggest that it is the type and configuration, rather than the
   diversity, of fire patches on the landscape that promote avian diversity
   and conserve ecological functions. A management approach is needed that
   includes significant coverage of adjacent newly burned and older,
   unburned savanna habitat; the latter, in particular, is inadequately
   represented under current burning practices.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In 1998, a restoration field trial was initiated in a catchment near
   Wellington (Western Cape, South Africa) to determine whether fynbos
   riparian scrub vegetation cleared of woody invasive alien trees require
   post-clearance restoration actions to accelerate indigenous vegetation
   recovery. The aim was to assess the relative effectiveness of three
   sowing treatments for restoring indigenous vegetation cover after the
   widely used ``Fell \& Burn{''} method of clearing invasive alien trees.
   Sowing treatments included non-invasive alien grasses to determine
   whether they have a negative effect on recovering native vegetation. A
   summer fire, eight years after trial initiation, provided an opportunity
   to determine how resilient restoration treatments are to alien
   re-invasion and fire. Restoring the site after alien clearing by sowing
   indigenous seeds increased both diversity, by improving species presence
   and abundance. However, a census done 8 years later (in 2006) revealed
   that seedlings of woody invasive alien plants dominated all plots, and
   had also survived the burn by resprouting, indicating the importance of
   follow-up control to justify initial clearing and restoration costs.
   Indigenous grass density was significantly reduced in plots where alien
   grasses were sown, while in the control and fynbos sowing treatment,
   indigenous grass density increased. By 2006, alien grass density was
   negligible in all treatments, indicating that the two grass species sown
   are not persistent or invasive. Active restoration of riparian areas
   after alien plant clearing has potential to facilitate vegetation
   recovery, but must be coupled with a long-term plan for adequate
   follow-up removal of post-clearance and post-fire alien recruits. (c)

Abstract = {{Contrasting evidence in the degree of post-fire conifer invasion
   reported for different regions of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) raises
   questions about the role of fire as a presumed driver of invasion. We
   studied the influence of fire on invasion responses (assessing
   `serotiny' and `time' as key factors to determine invasion) based on a
   review of case studies performed in natural habitats of the SH. Our work
   showed that burned environments have no lag time with respect to
   invasion and are more susceptible to serotinous pine invasion than are
   unburned environments. Also, serotinous pines reached extremely high
   densities in burned habitats, exceeding records for the same species in
   unburned habitats, as well as for non-serotinous pines in any habitat
   condition. Therefore, burned environments are impacted by conifer
   invasion earlier and more intensively than unburned ones. Overall, our
   work indicates that fire is a leading driver of invasion, but only for
   serotinous pines. This highlights the importance of considering life
   history traits of introduced species to determine the probability and
   extent of invasion in relation to disturbance. We discuss the
   implications of introducing serotinous species in regions of the SH
   where serotiny is absent from native flora. Lastly, we provide
   suggestions for prioritizing management and further study.}},

Abstract = {{The actual mechanism which causes plant death after having been burned
   has been poorly studied. One possibility is that fire causes direct, or
   indirect, fatal damage to plant hydraulic systems. If true, this
   suggests that burned plants ultimately die of drought. This hypothesis
   was tested on the post-fire response of a ``fire-resister{''} species of
   the Cape Proteaceae, as well as by analysing its morphology.
   Fire-resisters are plants which are incapable of resprouting, but
   nevertheless survive some fires. Mortality of the studied fire-resister
   appears to be compatible with a hydraulic death hypothesis because i)
   most post-fire mortality occurred within days, ii) it occurred from the
   base-upwards and iii) correlated negatively with stem diameter rather
   than plant height. Higher levels of survival of the fire-resister is
   probably due to absolutely thicker bark than co-occurring re-seeder
   species of the same age. Since this bark has not evolved to protect
   buds, it has probably evolved to protect stem hydraulic systems. (C)

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Background Pacific Northwest USA oak woodlands and savannas are
   fire-resilient communities dependent on frequent, low-severity fire to
   maintain their structure and understory species diversity, and to
   prevent encroachment by fire-sensitive competitors. The re-introduction
   of fire into degraded ecosystems is viewed as essential to their
   restoration, yet can be fraught with unintended negative consequences.
   We examined the response of mature Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana
   Douglas ex Hook.; Garry oak) to ``first entry{''} woodland restoration
   burns following long fire-free periods. Results Thirteen to twenty-five
   months post burn, topkill of oaks was minimal (3\%) and mortality was
   rare in three prescribed burns, despite high levels (mean = 92\%) of
   crown scorching, and irrespective of proportional duff consumption
   around oak bases (mean = 21\%). Percentage of crown scorch volume was
   the strongest predictor of oak crown dieback, but response was highly
   variable, especially when canopy scorch was >= 80\%. Comparison of our
   results with FOFEM (First Order Fire Effects Model), a common fire
   effects model, revealed high model inaccuracy, likely due to lack of a
   species-specific equation for prediction of Oregon white oak mortality.
   Conclusions The results of this study indicate that Oregon white oak is
   highly resistant to mortality in restoration burns, even following long
   fire-free intervals. Prescribed fire is not contraindicated in areas
   with extant mature oaks, and may promote oak regeneration via basal
   sprouting.}},

   Seven swales received 1 of 4 combinations of logging and contour

   high-severity fire, control first-year sediment yields averaged 2.8 to
   27 times greater than treated swales. Sediment yield was highly
   negatively correlated with increasing ground disturbance (R-2 = 0.87),
   including subsoiling and feller buncher tractor treads. Similar ground
   disturbance relationships were found for rill erosion measures: volume,
   surface area, and cross-sectional area at sediment fences. Control
   second-year sediment yields declined to 63\% of first-year values but
   were twice that of all treated swales. Treated swales without subsoiling

Abstract = {{Fire is the primary form of terrestrial ecosystem disturbance on a
   global scale. It affects the net carbon balance of terrestrial
   ecosystems by emitting carbon directly and immediately into the
   atmosphere from biomass burning (the fire direct effect), and by
   changing net ecosystem productivity and land-use carbon loss in
   post-fire regions due to biomass burning and fire-induced vegetation
   mortality ( the fire indirect effect). Here, we provide the first
   quantitative assessment of the impact of fire on the net carbon balance
   of global terrestrial ecosystems during the 20th century, and
   investigate the roles of fire's direct and indirect effects. This is
   done by quantifying the difference between the 20th century fire-on and
   fire-off simulations with the NCAR Community Land Model CLM4.5
   (prescribed vegetation cover and uncoupled from the atmospheric model)
   as a model platform. Results show that fire decreases the net carbon
   gain of global terrestrial ecosystems by 1.0 Pg Cyr(-1) averaged across
   the 20th century, as a result of the fire direct effect (1.9 Pg Cyr(-1))
   partly offset by the indirect effect (-0.9 Pg Cyr(-1)). Post-fire
   regions generally experience decreased carbon gains, which is
   significant over tropical savannas and some North American and East
   Asian forests. This decrease is due to the direct effect usually
   exceeding the indirect effect, while they have similar spatial patterns
   and opposite sign. The effect of fire on the net carbon balance
   significantly declines until similar to 1970 with a trend of 8 Tg
   Cyr(-1) due to an increasing indirect effect, and increases subsequently
   with a trend of 18 Tg Cyr(-1) due to an increasing direct effect. These
   results help constrain the global-scale dynamics of fire and the
   terrestrial carbon cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires coupled with logging have now become one of the most
   extensive causes of forest degradation, affecting the balance between
   carbon emissions and sequestration in lowland tropical forests in
   Southeast Asia. Being transient pools of disturbance-killed trees,
   coarse woody debris (CWD) stocks play a key role in the carbon budget of
   such disturbed forests. Here, we investigated for the first time how
   logging affects the CWD input during and following a fire and,
   consequently, post-fire CWD stocks. Measurements were made at a
   permanent site in Bukit Soeharto Education Forest (BSEF) in East
   Kalimantan, Indonesia. This site consisted of plots that had been
   subjected to three different logging intensities (HF: heavily felled,
   trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 30 cm were felled; LF:
   lightly felled, trees with DBH >= 50 cm were felled; UF: unfelled), all
   of which were burned by a fire that occurred during a drought associated
   with the El Nino Southern Oscillation in 1998, shortly after logging.
   CWD mass were measured in 2012, following 14 years of monitoring the CWD
   inputs. The average CWD mass across the three logging treatments was 89
   Mg ha(-1), which is higher than the reported values for undisturbed
   forests but within the recorded range for recently disturbed forests.
   The amount of CWD inputs due to tree death during the fire was similar
   among the three treatments. However, there was a large difference in the
   CWD input in the post-fire period. In UF plots, large CWD inputs lasted
   for 2 years following the fire due to delayed tree death, whereas in HF
   and LF plots, where the above-ground biomass had greatly reduced by
   selective logging, no further large CWD inputs occurred after the fire.
   Consequently, the CWD stocks in the HF and LF plots were 50-60\% lower
   than those in the UF plots. A simulation predicted that these CWD inputs
   during and shortly after the fire still constitute a large proportion of
   the CWD stocks in 2012, suggesting that the CWD pool is a rather durable
   carbon store in BSEF. In the HF and LF plots, there was few large
   diameter CWD pieces, reflecting the selective logging of large diameter
   trees, whereas, in the UF plots, there were large standing dead and
   uprooted trees. Since the larger diameter CWD pieces are persist in the
   forest for a longer time continuing to store carbon and to provide
   habitats for diverse wild life, selective logging could have large
   impacts on forest ecology and function not only by decreasing the total
   CWD inputs and stocks but also by decreasing the large diameter CWD
   pieces. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study concerned the mid-term regeneration of the woody understory
   vegetation of pure and mixed stands of Pinus pinaster Ait. and
   Eucalyptus globulus Labill. in northern and central Portugal following
   wildfires in 2005 and 2006. Pine and eucalypt stands are the most
   widespread and most fire-prone forest types in Portugal. The main aim
   was to investigate the importance of biogeography, topography, forest
   type and post-fire management operations in explaining the patterns in
   shrub diversity (species richness) and abundance (cover). To this end,
   284 study sites in four distinct biogeographic regions were sampled 5 to
   7 years following the last wildfire. At each site, the presence and
   cover of individual shrub species were estimated using 4 sub-plot of
   approximately 10 m(2) each. The entire data set was analyzed by means of
   GLM using a total of seven explanatory variables: biogeographic region,
   forest type, three types post-fire management operations (soil tillage,
   tree harvesting, and shrub clearance), and two topographic variables
   (slope angle and elevation). The GLM analysis was also done for the
   individual biogeographic regions.
   Biogeographic region and slope steepness were key factors explaining
   shrub species richness, albeit the role of slope angle was possibly
   linked to the intensity of past land use.
   Biogeographic region equally played a significant role in explaining the
   cover of all shrubs together as well as of the shrubs of Leguminosae and
   Cistaceae. All three types of post-fire management operations appeared
   to hamper the recovery of resprouters and Leguminosae, whereas just-tree
   harvesting and shrub clearance (but not soil tillage) negatively
   affected the cover of seeder species. These impacts of post-fire
   management operations had a noticeable region-specific component, being
   more relevant in the less productive biogeographic regions.
   Also the role of forest type depended strongly on biogeographic region.
   It was only significant in the South Mediterranean region, where pine
   plantations had a higher total shrub cover as well as higher covers of
   seeders and Cistaceae. Possibly, however, this significant role of
   forest type could be due to the lower incidence of shrub clearance in
   the pine stands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire refugia are forest patches that are minimally-impacted by fire
   and provide critical habitats for fire-sensitive species and seed
   sources for post-fire forest regeneration. Wildfire refugia are
   relatively understudied, particularly concerning the impacts of
   subsequent fires on existing refugia. We opportunistically re-visited
   122 sites classified in 1994 for a prior fire refugia study, which were
   burned by two wildfires in 2012 in the Cascade mountains of central
   Washington, USA. We evaluated the fire effects for historically
   persistent fire refugia and compared them to the surrounding
   non-refugial forest matrix. Of 122 total refugial (43 plots) and
   non-refugial (79 plots) sites sampled following the 2012 wildfires, one
   refugial and five non-refugial plots did not burn in 2012. Refugial
   sites burned more severely and experienced higher tree mortality than
   non-refugial plots, potentially due to the greater amount of time since
   the last fire, producing higher fuel accumulation. Although most sites
   maintained the pre-fire development stage, 19 percent of sites
   transitioned to Early development and 31 percent of sites converted from
   Closed to Open canopy. These structural transitions may contribute to
   forest restoration in fire-adapted forests where fire has been excluded
   for over a century, but this requires further analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities and climate change are increasing the size and severity
   of wildfires globally, creating a need for research that links changes
   in fire regimes with community-level responses. The objective of this
   study was to understand how variability in fire regimes influences
   forest regeneration and recruitment patterns and wildlife activity at
   large temporal and spatial scales. Across 25 fires in five National
   Forests (Uinta-Wasatch-Cache NF, Ashley NF, Fishlake NF, Dixie NF, and
   Manti-La Sal NF) in the state of Utah, we examined aspen regeneration
   and recruitment levels, and wildlife and livestock fecal group counts
   along belt transects that spanned gradients of fire size and severity.
   Forest cover change was assessed by comparing pre-fire and post-fire
   satellite images. The fires dated from 1992 to 2002 and were at least 10
   years old when this study was conducted. Fire size and severity were
   positively related to aspen regeneration (density of saplings) and
   recruitment (saplings >2 m in height). There was a significant fire size
   and severity interaction effect on aspen regeneration, such that the
   positive influence of fire size increased with greater fire severity
   (R-2 = 0.40, P < 0.001). Change in the extent of aspen cover was not
   correlated with fire size. Deer and cattle became more dispersed with
   increasing fire size and severity, but elk activity showed no
   difference. Deer preferred low severity burn patches in smaller fires,
   but appeared to avoid low severity patches as fires became larger. Our
   results suggest that fire size and severity are important ecological
   filters that can interact to affect forest development and the
   distribution and abundance of large herbivores. Effective management of
   forest systems in response to altered fire regimes will require an
   understanding of the legacy effects of fire size and severity at the

Abstract = {{Our objective was to model the radial growth response of individual
   ponderosa pines to prescribed burning in northern Arizona. We sampled
   188 trees from two study areas, which were burned in 1976. Within each
   study area, control and burned trees were of similar age, vigor, height,
   and competition index. At Chimney Spring, trees were older, less
   vigorous, and taller and had a higher competition index than at
   Brannigan. For each tree, periodic basal area increment (PBAI) was
   calculated for the years 1974-1984. To determine which variable would
   best model growth, post-fire growth (1977-1984) was correlated with the
   3 year average of previous growth, crown ratio, competition index, and
   diameter.
   Post-fire growth response was modeled using stepwise multiple linear
   regression as a function of previous growth and indicator variables for
   treatment, treatment-site interaction, climatic variation, and
   treatment-year interaction. Independent variables of the final model
   included previous growth, climatic variation, and treatment-year

   growth significantly and negatively for 2 years, and then burned trees
   grew similarly to control trees. Differences in management history at

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{1. Variations in disturbance regime strongly influence ecosystem
   structure and function. A prominent form of such variation is when
   multiple high-severity wildfires occur in rapid succession (i.e.
   short-interval (SI) severe fires, or `re-burns'). These events have been
   proposed as key mechanisms altering successional rates and pathways.
   2. We utilized a natural experiment afforded by two overlapping
   wildfires occurring within a 15-year interval in forests of the
   Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon (USA). We tested for unique effects
   of a SI fire (15-year interval before 2002 fire) by comparing vegetation
   communities 2 years post-fire to those following a long-interval (LI)
   fire (> 100-year interval before 2002 fire) and in mature/old-growth
   (M/OG) stands (no high-severity fire in > 100-year).
   3. Nearly all species found in M/OG stands were present at similar
   relative abundance in both the LI and SI burns, indicating high
   community persistence through multiple high-severity fires. However, the
   SI burn had the highest species richness and total plant cover with
   additions of disturbance-associated forbs and low shrubs, likely due to
   a propagule bank of early seral species that developed between fires.
   Persistence of flora was driven by vegetative sprouting, on-site seed
   banks, and dispersal from off-site seed sources. Several broadly
   generalizable plant functional traits (e.g. rapid maturation, long-lived
   seed banks) were strongly associated with the SI burn.
   4. Sprouting capacity of hardwoods and shrubs was unaltered by recurrent
   fire, but hardwood/shrub biomass was lower in the SI burn because
   individuals were smaller before the second fire. Conifer regeneration
   densities were high in both the SI and LI burns (range = 298-6086 and
   406-2349 trees ha(-1), respectively), reflecting similar availability of
   seed source and germination substrates.
   5. Synthesis. SI severe fires are typically expected to be deleterious
   to forest flora and development; however, these results indicate that in
   systems characterized by highly variable natural disturbances (e.g.
   mixed-severity fire regime), native biota possess functional traits
   lending resilience to recurrent severe fire. Compound disturbance
   resulted in a distinct early seral assemblage (i.e. interval-dependent
   fire effects), thus contributing to the landscape heterogeneity inherent
   to mixed-severity fire regimes. Process-oriented ecosystem management
   incorporating variable natural disturbances, including `extreme' events
   such as SI severe fires, would likely perpetuate a diversity of habitats
   and successional pathways on the landscape.}},

   succession and untreated control plot, which was located beyond the

   methods of renewal of the fire site, the soils have not undergone full
   microbiological regeneration. The soils at the fire site were mainly
   colonised by heterotrophic eubacteria. The population of these
   microorganisms, which were usually found in fresh litter and in the
   strict rhizosphere, was greater than in the soil of the control plot. On
   the other hand, there were low populations of actinobacteria, which
   regenerated poorly, especially at the accumulation and humus levels of
   the post-fire soils. The population of fungi was also lower than in the
   control soil. The applied methods of the fire site renewal have not had
   significant influence on the microbiological state of the soils under

Abstract = {{In the Patagonian Andean forests, wildfires principally have an

   They lead to severe losses of soil fertility and vegetation;
   particularly compromising the regeneration of native vegetation. Organic
   amendments can facilitate the regeneration of vegetation, enhancing
   principally soil fertility conditions. Our objective was to evaluate the
   effects of biosolids compost application as a tool for recovering soil
   fertility and regenerating vegetation in burnt areas of a Nothofagus
   pumilio forest along two growing seasons. Considering the National Park
   status of the study area, low rates (2 kg m(-2)) of biosolids compost
   application were used to minimize the polluting effect of this

   litter accumulation, in order to test whether biosolids application had
   a differential effect related to microsite type. Soil properties,
   composition and cover vegetation were evaluated. We concluded that
   biosolids compost application improved some of the physical-chemical,
   chemical and biological soil properties but did not contribute, over a
   period of almost two growing seasons, to vegetation recovery. These
   results confirm that organic amendment application may be used as an
   initial restoration strategy at microsite level in burnt N. pumilio
   forests related principally to a beneficial effect on soil fertility.
   The creation of fertility islands can be a valid restoration strategy,
   but mechanisms to increase the reinstallation of native vegetation

Abstract = {{The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires has led to growing
   attention to the effects of fire disturbance on soil microbial
   communities and biogeochemical cycling. While many studies have examined
   fire impacts on plant communities, and a growing body of research is
   detailing the effects of fire on soil microbial communities, little
   attention has been paid to the interaction between plant recolonization
   and shifts in soil properties and microbial community structure and
   function. In this study, we examined the effect of a common post-fire
   colonizer plant species, Corydalis aurea, on soil chemistry, microbial
   biomass, soil enzyme activity and bacterial community structure one year
   after a major forest wildfire in Colorado, USA, in severely burned and
   lightly burned soils. Consistent with past research, we find significant
   differences in soil edaphic and biotic properties between severe and
   light burn soils. Further, our work suggests an important interaction
   between fire severity and plant effects by demonstrating that the
   recolonization of soils by C. aurea plants only has a significant effect

Abstract = {{Following the Cedar Fire (one of seven large wildfires that burned in
   southern California during the autumn of 2003), aerial hydromulch was
   applied at 50 and 100\% cover to reduce hillslope erosion in chaparral
   shrublands. Our objectives were to determine the effectiveness of
   hydromulch in preventing erosion, and to see if plant recovery was
   hindered by treatment. We installed 54 silt fences to measure sediment
   production. Five 1-m(2) grids were placed behind each fence to measure
   plant recovery. Hydromulch was effective in reducing erosion immediately
   after the fire; however, its benefits appeared to be limited to the
   first 2-4 months following fire, raising doubts as to its overall
   cost-effectiveness. The rapid breakdown of the hydromulch during the
   first 6 months after the wildfire provided little hillslope protection
   during the above-average October 2004 storm events. During the October
   events, both rainfall amount and storm intensity played a role in the
   magnitude of sediment production. Hydromulch did not affect post-fire
   plant recovery, with plant cover measuring>60\% at all sites less than 2
   years following the wildfire. Accelerated growth of chamise and forbs
   was likely due to hydromulch prolonging soil moisture retention. Large
   accumulations of dead litter following die-off of the herbaceous species
   could increase dry fuels, thus promoting wildfire and therefore
   shortening the fire return interval.}},

Abstract = {{The severity of the 2000 Samcheok forest fire was classified by using

   results from fire severity estimation, of the 10,600 ha forest stands,
   28\% was severely damaged by crown fires, 38\% was moderately damaged,
   and the remaining 34\% was damaged slightly by surface fires. The
   overall accuracy of the fire severity classification was 83\% (Kappa
   coefficient = 0.76). The results of chi(2)-tests showed that fire
   severity differed significantly with the vegetation and topographic
   conditions as follows. The coniferous stands, compared with the mixed
   and broad-leaved, were more vulnerable to fire damage; the higher the
   slope of fire sites, the greater the fire damage; the south was the most
   vulnerable aspect; fire severity of coniferous forest stands increased

Abstract = {{Encroachment of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) shrublands by pinyon (Pinus
   spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) conifers (woodland encroachment)
   induces a shift from biotic-controlled resource retention to
   abiotic-driven loss of soil resources. This shift is driven by a
   coarsening of the vegetation structure with increasing dominance of site
   resources by trees. Competition between the encroaching trees and
   understory vegetation for limited soil and water resources facilitates
   extensive bare intercanopy area between trees and concomitant increases
   in run-off and erosion that, over time, propagate persistence of the
   shrubland-to-woodland conversion. We evaluated whether tree removal by
   burning can decrease late-succession woodland ecohydrologic resilience
   by increasing vegetation and ground cover over a 9-year period after
   fire and whether the soil erosion feedback on late-succession woodlands
   is reversible by burning. To address these questions, we employed a
   suite of vegetation and soil measurements and rainfall simulation and
   concentrated overland flow experiments across multiple plot scales on
   unburned and burned areas at two sagebrush sites in the later stages of
   woodland succession. Prior to burning, tree cover was approximately 28\%
   at the sites, and more than 70\% of the area at the sites was
   intercanopy with depauperate understory vegetation and extensive bare
   ground (52-60\% bare soil and rock). Burning initially increased bare
   ground across fine (<1m(2)) to patch (tens of metres) scales, resulting
   in enhanced sediment availability at the fine scale, sustained high
   run-off and erosion within degraded intercanopies, amplified run-off and
   erosion from tree canopy areas, and amplified sediment delivery across
   fine to patch scales. However, fire-induced increases in grass cover
   over nine growing seasons improved infiltration, limited run-off and
   sediment delivery from the fine scale, and reduced intercanopy run-off
   and erosion at the patch scale. These changes reflect a switch in
   vegetation structure, triggered by burning and subsequent vegetation
   re-establishment, and a shift to biotic control on run-off and erosion
   across spatial scales. The responses and persistence over the 9-year
   period postfire at the two sites demonstrate that fire can decrease
   woodland ecohydrologic resilience by altering plant community
   physiognomy and thereby can reverse the soil erosion feedback on
   sagebrush shrublands in the later stages of woodland encroachment.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important tool for fuel reduction, the control of
   competing vegetation, and forest restoration. The accumulated fuels
   associated with historical fire exclusion can cause undesirably high
   tree mortality rates following prescribed fires and wildfires. This is
   especially true for sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas), which is
   already negatively affected by the introduced pathogen white pine
   blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Rabenh). We tested the
   efficacy of raking away fuels around the base of sugar pine to reduce
   mortality following prescribed fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national
   parks, California, USA. This study was conducted in three prescribed
   fires and included 457 trees, half of which had the fuels around their
   bases raked away to mineral soil to 0.5 m away from the stem. Fire
   effects were assessed and tree mortality was recorded for three years
   after prescribed fires. Overall, raking had no detectable effect on
   mortality: raked trees averaged 30\% mortality compared to 36\% for
   unraked trees. There was a significant effect, however, between the
   interaction of raking and average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth:
   the predicted probability of survival of a 50 cm dbh tree was 0.94 vs.
   0.96 when average pre-treatment fuel depth was 0 cm for a raked and
   unraked tree, respectively. When average pre-treatment forest floor fuel
   depth was 30 cm, the predicted probability of survival for a raked 50 cm
   dbh tree was 0.60 compared to only 0.07 for an unraked tree. Raking did
   not affect mortality when fire intensity, measured as percent crown
   volume scorched, was very low (0\% scorch) or very high (>80\% scorch),
   but the raking treatment significantly increased the proportion of trees
   that survived by 9.6\% for trees that burned under moderate fire
   intensity (1\% to 80\% scorch). Raking significantly reduced the
   likelihood of bole charring and bark beetle activity three years post
   fire. Fuel depth and anticipated fire intensity need to be accounted for
   to maximize the effectiveness of the treatments. Raking is an important
   management option to reduce tree mortality from prescribed fire, but is
   most effective under specific fuel and burning conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of the endangered Leadbeater's Possum, Gymnobelideus
   leadbeateri is one of the most contentious forestry issues in Australia.
   The challenge is to identify strategies to conserve the species in the
   significant portion of its range in the central highlands of Victoria
   (southeastern Australia) where timber harvesting occurs. We used ALEX, a
   simulation program for population viability analysis to explore the
   effectiveness of potential forest management strategies to enhance the
   Persistence of G. leadbeateti in areas of wood production. Our study
   focused on the relationship between the risk of metapopulation
   extinction and (1) the number and spatial arrangement of 50-ha logging
   areas that could be reserved from timber harvesting and (2) the impacts
   of postfire salvage logging in reserved areas We modeled complex patch
   structures within two forest blocks (Murrindindi and Steavenson) that
   were based on maps of both existing patches of suitable habitat for G.
   leadbeateri and the location of potential logging areas We recorded high
   values for the probability of extinction of metapopulations of G.
   leadbeateri when existing strategies for the conservation of the species
   within the Murrindindi and Steavenson Forest Blocks were modeled
   Exclusion of salvage logging operations from burned, old-growth forests
   significantly improved the species' prospects of survival in both the
   short and long term. Withdrawal of timber harvesting from some proposed
   logging coupes made a significant, positive long-term contribution to
   metapopulation persistence. But there will be a delay of at least 150
   years until areas set aside note maize a significant contribution to
   metapopulation persistence. This is the time required for existing
   stands of regrowth to develop old-growth characteristics that are an
   essential habitat component for G. leadbeateri We examined the
   effectiveness of different designs for setting aside a total reserved
   area of 300 ha. These ranged from a single 300 ha reserve to 12, 25-ha
   reserves Populations in smaller reserves were vulnerable to extinction
   front demographic stochasticity and environmental variability.
   Conversely, a small number of larger reserves were susceptible to
   destruction in a single, catastrophic wildfire, highlighting the need
   for several dispersed reserves. Analyses of the sensitivity of various
   management options to variations in fire frequency and extent, movement
   capability and a wide range of other factors indicated that the
   conservation strategy that gave the best relative outcome for G.
   leadbeateri was both to set aside several 50 to 100-ha reserves in every
   forest block and to preclude post-fire salvage logging operations from
   these areas if they burned in a wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Reestablishing historical fire regimes is a high priority for North
   American coniferous forests, particularly ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) ecosystems. These forests are also used extensively for
   cattle (Bos spp.) grazing. Prescribed fires are being applied on or
   planned for millions of hectares of these forests to reduce fuel loads,
   alter forest structure, and maintain and enhance the productivity of
   native plant communities. However, cattle grazing is ubiquitous in
   ponderosa pine forests and the consequences of post-fire cattle grazing
   on plant communities are not well understood. We evaluated cattle
   grazing effects (grazing, no grazing) on upland bunchgrass and Carex
   geyeri dominated ponderosa pine plant communities over five growing
   seasons after prescribed fires (spring reburn, fall reburn, no burn).
   Vegetation was measured prior to a 5-year interval reburn and the
   subsequent exclusion of cattle, and in the second and fifth growing
   seasons thereafter. We found no interactions between reburning and
   grazing for the understory response variables. For all reburn
   treatments, including unburned areas, five growing seasons of cattle
   grazing exclusion significantly increased: (1) total vegetative cover,
   (2) native perennial forb cover, (3) grass stature, (4) grass flowering
   stem density, and (5) the cover of some shrub species and functional
   groups. Grazing exclusion did not strongly affect plant compositional
   patterns, although differences were detected. Compared to unburned
   areas, neither spring nor fall reburning increased perennial native
   species cover or richness, and reburning reduced sedge cover. Fall
   reburning increased cover of native colonizers, and exotic species cover
   and richness (largely Bromus tectorum and Cirsium vulgare), although
   overall exotic cover remains low (<1\%). We document several potentially
   chronic impacts of cattle grazing in both burned and unburned areas, and
   show that the understory release from a long history of cattle grazing
   caused a greater degree of change than the initial reintroduction of
   fire. If a goal of ecological restoration in these forests is increased
   cover of native perennial plants, and the potential for increased native
   perennial grass reproduction, then cattle grazing exclusion, or a change
   in cattle management, could provide critically important options in
   restoration plans.}},

   bird response to repeated fuel reduction treatments by mechanical
   understory reduction (twice; Mechanical-only), prescribed burning (four
   times; Burn-only), or mechanical understory reduction plus burning (then
   three subsequent burns; Mechanical + Burn). Initial burns were hotter in
   Mechanical + Burn than Burn-only resulting in heavy tree mortality,
   canopy openness, thick shrub density, and abundant snags lasting several
   years. Relative density and species richness of birds increased in
   Mechanical + Burn within three breeding seasons of high severity burns,
   and remained greater throughout subsequent burn. Increases were due to
   an influx of species associated with young forest conditions, with
   little change in most mature forest species. Repeated burning in
   Mechanical + Burn likely impeded forest maturation, allowing many
   scrub-shrub bird species to persist. Species richness in Burn-only did
   not differ from any treatment, but modest increases over time were
   apparent as structural heterogeneity increased with delayed tree
   mortality. Cavity-nester density was highest in Mechanical + Burn, but
   remained high even as snags fell to pretreatment levels. Ground-nester
   density was lower in Mechanical + Burn than Control and Mechanical-only,
   but ground-nesting species responded differently. Open woodlands were
   not created by any treatment due to persistent re-sprouting of

   respond similarly to high-severity burns and silvicultural treatments
   with heavy canopy reduction, offering possible alternatives in managing
   upland hardwood forests for diverse breeding bird communities.}},

   Northwest Patagonia, Argentina.
   We studied the effect of fire on S. bracteolatus recruitment and density
   by comparing these variables between burned and unburned grasslands. In
   burned areas, we compared abiotic characteristics and seedling
   establishment under the canopy of grasses (S. speciosa) and in gaps
   (inter-tussock areas). Post-fire interactions between S. bracteolatus
   seedlings and S. speciosa were studied using field and greenhouse
   experiments.
   Density of S. bracteolatus was higher in burned than in unburned areas.
   In burned sites, seedlings were more abundant under tussock grasses,
   whereas juveniles were more abundant in gaps. Tussocks generated more
   attenuated micro-environmental conditions than gaps during stressful
   summers. Gaps were more abundant in burned sites, while ``under
   tussock{''} microsites were more frequent in unburned sites. In burned
   areas, tussocks allowed higher establishment of seedlings
   (facilitation), but gaps allowed more seedling growth and higher
   persistence of juveniles.
   Fire promoted S. bracteolatus recruitment in Patagonian grasslands by
   increasing the availability of favourable gap microsites. Grass
   protection for shrub seedlings became negative with time, probably due
   to competition with grasses. Gaps led to better performance and
   persistence of shrub plants. Six years after fire, higher shrub
   recruitment and adult density (observed as a trend) in burned grassland
   provides an opportunity for potential S. bracteolatus invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are inherently dynamic systems having developed with frequent
   disturbance from fire and grazing that varies in space and time to
   create heterogeneity. Today, many management practices emphasize the
   even use of grasslands by grazers and either no fire or uniform fires,
   resulting in grasslands that lack the variability in plant structure and
   composition to support the entire suite of grassland biodiversity.
   Previous research has suggested that the reintroduction of variable
   disturbance may be among the best conservation strategies for grassland
   birds, as these practices promote diversity and abundance of many
   species. However, the reintroduction of heterogeneity is taking place in
   the context of the continued development of grasslands for energy
   production, and the utility of heterogeneity based management practices
   may decline in fragmented landscapes. We investigated how fragmentation
   from oil and gas may constrain management efforts to promote
   biodiversity by evaluating changes in bird abundance with distance from
   roads and conventional oil wells across a gradient of times since fire.
   We found that time since fire was the primary driver of grassland bird
   distribution, with dickcissels, eastern meadowlark and grasshopper
   sparrows occurring in all vegetation patches, while Henslow's sparrows
   primarily occurred in patches that were greater than 13 months post-fire
   and upland sandpipers were mostly detected in recent burns. Further,
   Henslow's sparrows avoided oil wells for considerable distances, while
   eastern meadowlark was more abundant in areas close to oil wells in
   vegetation patches that were one-year post-fire. Grasshopper sparrows
   avoided roads in recent burns and dickcissels, and eastern meadowlarks
   were attracted to roads in patches that were recently burned and
   one-year post-fire, respectively. The restoration of heterogeneous fire
   regimes will benefit bird communities by creating variable vegetation
   structure that can support multiple grassland bird species; however,
   energy development has the potential to fragment grasslands for some
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Representation of precipitation is one of the most difficult aspects of
   modelling post-fire runoff and erosion and also one of the most
   sensitive input parameters to rainfall-runoff models. The impact of
   post-fire convective rainstorms, especially in semiarid watersheds,
   depends on the overlap between locations of high-intensity rainfall and
   areas of high-severity burns. One of the most useful applications of
   models in post-fire situations is risk assessment to quantify peak flow
   and identify areas at high risk of flooding and erosion. This study used
   the KINEROS2/AGWA model to compare several spatial and temporal rainfall
   representations of post-fire rainfall-runoff events to determine the
   effect of differing representations on modelled peak flow and determine
   at-risk locations within a watershed. Post-fire rainfall-runoff events
   at Zion National Park in Utah and Bandelier National Monument in New
   Mexico were modelled. Representations considered included both uniform
   and Soil Conservation Service Type II hyetographs, applying rain over
   the entire watershed and applying rain only on the burned area, and
   varying rainfall both temporally and spatially according to radar data.
   Results showed that rainfall representation greatly affected modelled
   peak flow, but did not significantly alter the model's predictions for
   high-risk locations. This has important implications for post-fire
   assessments before a flood-inducing rainfall event, or for post-storm
   assessments in areas with low-gauge density or lack of radar data due to
   mountain beam blockage.}},

   phenological stages {[}vegetative (early-season defoliation) and
   internode elongation (late-season defoliation)] on growth of
   Piptochaetium napostaense and Poa ligularis, two very important

   did not affect the number of green leaves on tillers of P napostaense.
   Early-season post-fire defoliation generally reduced the number of green
   leaves on tillers of P ligularis in comparison to those in control
   plants. Late-season defoliation, however, usually increased the number
   of green leaves on tillers of P ligularis. Nevertheless, very few
   significant (p<0.05) differences were detected within either one or the
   other phenological stage. Height and total green length (leaves + stem +
   sheaths) of tillers on plants of P napostaense and P ligularis exposed
   to defoliation were lower (p<0.05) or similar (p>0.05) than values on
   non-defoliated plants, respectively. Immediately after early- and
   late-season defoliation treatments, relative growth rates for tiller

Abstract = {{1. Fire-prone woodlands and savannas world-wide face management
   challenges resulting from fire exclusion and subsequent encroachment of
   fire sensitivetrees. In the Pacific Northwest (USA), Quercus garryana
   oak woodlands and savannas are threatened by encroachment from the
   native conifer Pseudotsuga menziesii in the absence of fire.
   2. In the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park (California, USA),
   prescribed fire and conifer removal have been used to restore encroached
   woodlands. We examined the effects of encroachment and restoration on
   understorey vegetation, comparing four treatments: prescribed fire,
   prescribed fire and conifer removal, conifer removal, and encroached
   (control).
   3. Treatments including prescribed fire had the greatest native species
   richness. These two treatments also had the greatest non-native species
   richness, at both the site level and the treatment level. Woodlands
   treated with conifer removal and no prescribed lire were intermediate in
   species richness and diversity compared to burned treatments and
   encroached woodlands. Encroached woodlands had diminished richness and
   diversity compared to all restoration treatments. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination demonstrated that conifer
   basal area, conifer litter and fine wood were associated with low
   species richness and diversity and that elevation and thatch were
   associated with higher species richness and diversity. Indicator species
   analysis identified that most native species and non-native species were
   associated with burned woodlands that were never encroached.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both prescribed
   fire and conifer removal have benefits for understorey plant
   communities, increasing species richness, diversity and cover in oak
   woodlands and shifting understorey communities from forest-associated
   species to more woodland-associated species. Restoration of remnant
   Quercus garryana oak woodlands is complicated by the persistence and
   abundance of non-native herbaceous plants.}},

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands are an
   important vegetation type in the Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, and
   southwestern desert regions of the western US that is undergoing
   substantial changes associated with land management, altered disturbance
   regimes, and climate change. We synthesized literature on the
   ecohydrologic impacts of pinyon and juniper tree reductions across plot
   to watershed scales, short- and long-term periods, and regional climatic
   gradients. We found that the initial plot- to hillslope-scale
   ecohydrologic and erosion impacts of tree reduction on pinyon and
   juniper woodlands by fire, mechanical tree removal, or drought depend
   largely on: (1) the degree to which these perturbations alter vegetation
   and ground cover structure, (2) initial conditions, and (3) inherent
   site attributes. Fire commonly imparts an initial increased risk for
   hillslope runoff and erosion that degrades over time with vegetation and
   ground cover recovery whereas tree reductions by mechanical means pose
   fewer initial negative ecohydrologic impacts. Tree reduction by either
   approach can enhance understory vegetation and improve site-level
   ecohydrologic function over time, particularly on sites with an
   initially favorable cover of native herbaceous vegetation and a
   cool-season precipitation regime. Understory vegetation and ground cover
   enhancements appear to increase ecohydrologic resilience of some
   woodland communities to disturbances such as drought, fire, and insect
   infestations. In contrast, intensive land use, prolonged drought or
   repeated burning associated with invasions of fire-prone grasses can
   propagate long-term site degradation through persistent elevated runoff
   and erosion rates. Our synthesis suggests the annual precipitation
   requirement for increases in plot- to hillslope-scale soil water
   availability for herbaceous enhancement through tree removal likely
   ranges from 200-400 mm for sites in the Great Basin and northern
   Colorado Plateau (cool-season precipitation regimes), and, although
   suggested with great uncertainty, likely exceeds 400 mm for woodlands
   with rain-dominated precipitation regimes in the southwestern US.
   Overall, literature is inconclusive regarding tree reduction impacts on
   watershed-scale changes in groundwater and streamflow. To date, there is
   little evidence that drought-related changes to vegetation in pinyon and
   juniper woodlands substantially affect watershed-scale water
   availability and streamflow at the annual time scale. Our synthesis
   identifies key knowledge gaps to overcome in improving understanding of
   the ecohydrologic and erosion impacts of broadly occurring pinyon and
   juniper tree reductions in the western US.}},

Abstract = {{Field observations using chronosequences are helpful to study vegetation
   succession. This method allows to establish comparisons based on soil
   composition, stand structure, micro-and macrofossil remains from sites
   of different ages but on similar edaphic and topographic conditions. In
   the boreal forest, post-fire succession through time is triggered by
   climate, disturbance history (insect epidemics, fire and logging),
   latitude and altitude. The main objective of this research is to
   identify the main patterns of early post-fire succession, including
   similarities and differences in vegetation composition and attributes,
   of three contrasted ecosystems distributed along an altitudinal
   gradient. To do so, we have monitored the successional development of
   the alpine, subalpine and boreal lichen-woodland sites during the first
   21 years (1991 to 2011) of post-fire sequence in eastern Canada 1991 to
   2011. Each site was characterized by a different functional group that
   became established following fire. A rapid resurgence of ericaceous
   shrubs and lichens was observed in the lichen woodland and subalpine
   sites. Bryophyte and lichen species were not an important component of
   vegetation communities during the earlier stages of post-fire
   succession. For all three sites monitored, lichens were the last
   functional group to establish in the chronosequences. Herbs and mosses
   characterized the post-fire succession in alpine areas, the latter
   functional group established late in the chronosequence to cover > 25\%
   of the site after 15 years. Post-fire chronosequences in the three
   contrasted environments indicate that plant succession is a repetitive
   process often involving similar resilient plant assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Local ecosystem resilience to fire disturbance can be influenced by
   multiple factors, from topography and climate, to fire history and

   factors affecting post-fire recovery of scrub vegetation in areas under
   Mediterranean climate affected by frequent fires. We hypothesized that,
   under comparable climatic and topographic conditions, geological factors
   (with bedrock type as a proxy) would be at least as important as fire
   history in explaining patterns of post-fire recovery. We surveyed scrub
   vegetation in a mountain study area in Portugal, using a stratified
   random sampling scheme, with fire frequency, time since last fire, and
   bedrock type (granite vs. schist) as stratifying layers. Based on
   vegetation and plant community data from 40 plots, we analyzed total
   species richness and composition, and the relative abundance of
   functional groups defined on the basis of general (non fire-specific)
   life-history traits. We found that, at a local scale, lithology can
   override fire history in determining post-fire recovery. Vegetation
   plots on granite exhibited a considerable development of tall scrubs and
   higher values of total species richness. They also hosted higher numbers
   of animal-dispersed woody species, of trees and tall scrubs, of woody
   deciduous species, and of forest, edge and tall scrub species.
   Differences in the post-fire development of scrub vegetation and in the

Abstract = {{The recent mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak across western North
   America's interior lodgepole pine forests has altered the landscape such
   that the majority of wildfires in the region will now burn through
   MPB-affected stands. Study of plant community response to these combined
   disturbances is critical for our understanding and management of these
   pine forests. Based on data collected from an experimental burn project
   in central interior British Columbia, Canada, we investigate variation
   in understory plant communities along a gradient of disturbance that
   includes MPB-only and red-phase MPB + fire across three levels of fire
   severity. We compare communities pre-fire and five years post-fire using
   three hypotheses that predict community response to disturbance: the
   light hypothesis, the divergence-convergence hypothesis, and the fire
   severity begets pine hypothesis.
   Comparisons of pine and fir tree seedling tallies suggest a divergence
   in composition along the disturbance severity gradient. Pine seedlings
   were mostly absent from the unburned treatment but dominated the burned
   treatments with densities increasing at higher severities. For the
   non-tree understory community, canopy-opening associated with both
   unburned and with low through moderate-high severity burning results in
   a convergence of general plant community structure demonstrated by
   rank-abundance curves, but divergent community membership associated
   with fire severity and fire-adaptive traits. Communities in the unburned
   treatment saw a release due to canopy opening that supported increases
   in the dominant shrubs and understory fir seedlings. In the burned
   treatments, shrubs also increased in dominance and community membership
   was determined by fire-adaptive traits with fire-adapted species being
   most abundant in the highest severity fire treatments. Overall, the
   communities appear to be resilient to the combined effects of MPB
   (red-phase) and low to moderate-high severity burning, but further
   research is required in the grey-phase of beetle-kill to broaden our
   understanding of the landscape legacy of this recent insect outbreak.

Abstract = {{We explored models explaining population cycling in the annual Warea

   an annual time step for two populations, including four stages,
   (recently produced seeds, seeds in the seed bank, seedlings, and adults)
   and five vital rates, summarized in seven transitions. Fluctuations of
   both observed and modeled populations were evaluated using power
   spectra, autocorrelation, amplitude, and damping. Observed populations
   had two point cycling. Observed amplitude was higher in frequently
   burned populations, reached its maximum 1 year after fire, and then
   dampened. Asymptotic transition and vital rate elasticities showed that
   seedling survival was the most important factor for long-term population
   growth, but transient elasticities showed that recruitment from the seed
   bank was important during the first years post-fire. Deterministic
   modeling and elasticity analyses indicated that delayed germination (for
   1 year) may explain biennial population cycling. Stochastic models
   created similar cycling with slower damping than deterministic models,
   but still had lower amplitudes (especially 1-3 years post-fire) than
   observed populations. The biennial cycle in W. carteri is likely caused
   by the delay in seed germination, which creates two overlapping cohorts
   of plants, much like a strict biennial. Fire initiates the cycle by
   killing aboveground individuals and promoting seedling recruitment in
   the first post-fire year.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Post-fire regeneration is a key process in
   Mediterranean shrubland dynamics, strongly determining the functional
   properties of the community. In this study, a test is carried out to
   deteremine whether there is co-variation between species regenerative
   types and functional attributes related to water use.
   Methods An analysis was made of the seasonal variations in leaf relative
   water content (RWC), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf moisture (LM)
   and live fine fuel moisture (LFFM) in 30 woody species of a coastal
   shrubland, with different post-fire regenerative strategies (seeding,
   resprouting or both).
   Key Results RWC results suggest that the studied resprouters have more
   efficient mechanisms to reduce water losses and maintain water supply
   between seasons. In contrast, seeders are more drought tolerant. LDMC is
   higher in resprouters over the course of the year, suggesting a more
   efficient conservation of nutrients. The weight of the phylogenetic
   constraint to understand differences between regenerative strategies
   tends to be important for LDMC, while it is not the case for variables
   such as RWC.
   Conclusions Groups of species with different post-fire regenerative
   strategies (seeders and resprouters) have different functional traits
   related to water use. In addition to the role of phylogenetical
   constraints, these differences are also likely to be related to the
   respective life history characteristics. Therefore, the presence and
   abundance of species with different post-fire regenerative responses
   influence the functional properties of the communities.}},

   Mammals were captured in similar Cerrado sites that differed in time
   since the last burn ( 1 to 26 yr). We sampled six sites in the wet
   season of 1997 ( phase 1) and, three years later, six sites in the wet
   and dry seasons ( phase 2). Six rodent species and four marsupials were
   captured. Community composition changed drastically as a function of
   time since fire. The diversity and abundance of small mammals reached
   maximum values in the early successional stages. The rodent Calomys
   tener was present only in early seral stages. The rodent Bolomys
   lasiurus was more frequent in mid-successional stages and decreased in
   later seral stages, and the rodent Oryzomys subflavus occupied all
   successional stages. The marsupial Gracilinanus agilis was dominant in
   the area that did not burn for at least 23 yr. Changes in composition of
   the community of small mammals were more accelerated in early
   successional stages, when there are more drastic vegetational changes.
   The ability of small mammals to cope with Cerrado fires and the great

   However, do post-harvest and post-fire patches maintain the same
   structural complexity? This study compares post-harvest and post-fire
   residual patches and proposes retention modalities that can maintain the
   same structural complexity as in natural forests, here considering both
   continuous forest stands and post-fire residual patches. In boreal black
   spruce forests, 41 post-fire residual patches, and 45 post-harvest
   retention patches of varying size and ages (exposure time to disturbed
   matrix) and 37 continuous forest stands were classified into six
   diameter structure types. Types 1 (inverted-J) and 2 (trunked-unimodal)
   characterized stands dominated by small trees. The abundance of small
   trees decreased and the abundance of large trees increased from Type 1
   to Type 6. Type 6 had the most irregular structure with a wide range of
   diameters. This study indicates that: (1) old post-harvest residual
   retentions maintained the range of structural complexity found in
   natural stands; (2) Types 1 and 2 were generally associated with young
   post-fire patches and post-harvest retention clumps; (3) the structure
   of residual patches containing only small trees was usually younger (in
   terms of the age of the original forest from which residual patches were
   formed) than those with larger trees. To avoid the risk of simplifying
   the structure, retention patches should be intentionally oriented
   towards Types 3-6, dominated by intermediate and large trees.}},

Abstract = {{The Blue Mountains water skink (Eulamprus leuraensis; Scincidae) is
   restricted to less than 40 fragmented swamp sites, all within the Blue
   Mountains and Newnes Plateau areas of New South Wales, Australia.
   Climate change is expected to increase fire frequency in the area,
   potentially degrading habitat quality for this endangered reptile. We
   quantified lizard abundances in 12 swamps using standardized surveys,
   and constructed a Global Information System (GIS) database to determine
   fire-histories for each swamp since 1967. The abundance of Blue
   Mountains water skinks was negatively correlated with fire frequency,
   but not with time since fire. Indirect impacts of fire (mediated via
   shifts in vegetation density, moisture levels, prey availability and
   post-fire predation) may be more important than direct effects in these
   cool, moist habitats. Although lizards were less common in swamps close
   to urban areas, and less common in frequently burnt areas, viable
   populations of this endangered reptile still persist even in
   anthropogenically disturbed swamps and in swamps that have experienced
   up to four fires in 20 years. Future research could usefully extend
   these analyses to other swamps in the locality, and explore the broader

Abstract = {{Carbon budget of Siberian boreal forests is one of the largest
   uncertainties in the global carbon cycle under changing environment and
   then climate prediction. A coupled carbon cycle and fire regime model,
   which is applicable to simulate carbon budget of a fire-prone boreal
   forest in eastern Siberia, was developed in this paper. The carbon model
   consists of 10 pools and represents carbon dynamics including biomass
   burning, on the basis of an ecophysiological carbon cycle model
   (Sim-CYCLE). The fire model simulates fire behavior (ignition,
   expansion, and extinction) at a landscape scale with a spatially
   explicit cellular automaton, in a stochastic manner. Fire spread and
   burning intensity are parameterized as functions of temperature,
   moisture, and fuel availability, and ground fire and crown fire are
   dealt with separately. Interactions between the carbon cycle and fire
   behavior models are included, such that the carbon model simulates fuel
   dynamics and post-fire vegetation growth and the fire model simulates
   biomass burning (carbon dioxide emission, detritus production, and
   charcoal formation). The model was calibrated at a deciduous
   needle-leaved (larch) forest near Yakutsk, Russia (62 degrees N, 130
   degrees E), in which Japanese researchers conducted surveys of carbon
   dynamics. The long-term simulation (1200 years) indicated that the mean
   fire interval of the larch forest was as short as 64 years, and most
   fires (94\% of burnt area) occurred as ground fires. Although crown
   fires were less frequent (6\% of burnt area), they exerted more severe
   impacts on carbon storage than ground fires. On average, the biomass
   burning released about 12\% of carbon fixed by plant photosynthesis
   directly and resulted in acceleration of carbon cycling of the boreal
   forest. Young post-fire forests exhibited higher photosynthetic activity
   and compensated for the loss of old stands. Sensitivity of the model
   simulation to variation in parameter values and environmental conditions
   was examined. Finally, the simulation analysis confirmed that the fire
   regime is an important ecosystem attribute, and that a coupled carbon
   and fire model is useful to investigate the carbon budget of boreal
   forest in eastern Siberia. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) is one of the warmest parts of the
   Arctic tundra biome and tundra fires are common in its upland areas.
   Here, we combine field measurements, Landsat observations, and
   quantitative cover maps for tundra plant functional types (PFTs) to
   characterize multi-decadal succession and landscape change after fire in
   lichen-dominated upland tundra of the YKD, where extensive wildfires
   occurred in 1971-1972, 1985, 2006-2007, and 2015. Unburned tundra was
   characterized by abundant lichens, and low lichen cover was consistently
   associated with historical fire. While we observed some successional
   patterns that were consistent with earlier work in Alaskan tussock
   tundra, other patterns were not. In the landscape we studied, a large
   proportion of pre-fire moss cover and surface peat tended to survive
   fire, which favors survival of existing vascular plants and limits
   opportunities for seed recruitment. Although shrub cover was much higher
   in 1985 and 1971-1972 burns than in unburned tundra, tall shrubs (>0.5 m
   height) were rare and the PFT maps indicate high landscape-scale
   variability in the degree and persistence of shrub increase after fire.
   Fire has induced persistent changes in species composition and structure
   of upland tundra on the YKD, but the lichen-dominated fuels and thick
   surface peat appear to have limited the potential for severe fire and
   accompanying edaphic changes. Soil thaw depths were about 10 cm deeper
   in 2006-2007 burns than in unburned tundra, but were similar to unburned
   tundra in 1985 and 1971-1972 burns. Historically, repeat fire has been
   rare on the YKD, and the functional diversity of vegetation has
   recovered within several decades post-fire. Our findings provide a basis
   for predicting and monitoring post-fire tundra succession on the YKD and
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Fire severity maps are an important tool for understanding fire effects
   on a landscape. The relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR)
   is a commonly used severity index in California forests, and is
   typically divided into four categories: unchanged, low, moderate, and
   high. RdNBR is often calculated twice. from images collected the year of
   the fire (initial assessment) and during the summer of the year after
   the fire (extended assessment). Both collection times have been
   calibrated to field measurements, but field data with both pre-fire and
   post-fire observations of matched plots are typically not available.
   This study uses a large network of field plots (n = 175) that was
   surveyed the year of and one year after a large wildfire in the central
   Sierra Nevada, USA, to quantify forest structure, mortality, and fire
   effects within fire severity categories from both the initial and
   extended RdNBR assessments. Most plots were classified in the same
   severity category in both assessments, particularly when mortality was
   high. Comparing initial and extended assessments, plots with lower
   pre-fire basal area were more likely to be classified at lower severity
   in the extended assessment, while plots with greater tree density were
   more likely to be classified at higher severity. High-severity plots had
   significantly greater pre-fire density of small trees. The high-severity
   category clearly captured stand-replacing fire effects (>95 \% basal
   area mortality, >99 \% tree density mortality), with typically all trees
   exhibiting high levels of crown consumption and scorching. In other
   severity categories, most large-sized and intermediate-sized trees
   survived, and moderate-severity fire favored survival of
   shade-intolerant species. Results suggest that both the initial and
   extended RdNBR assessments give an accurate representation of forest
   structural change in mixed-conifer forests following fire, particularly
   those of high severity.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic shrubs are significant invaders of the tropical woodlands of

Journal = {{ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Wind erosion of soils burned by wildfire contributes substantial
   particulate matter (PM) in the form of dust to the atmosphere, but the
   magnitude of this dust source is largely unknown. It is important to
   accurately quantify dust emissions because they can impact human health,
   degrade visibility, exacerbate dust-on-snow issues (including snowmelt
   timing, snow chemistry, and avalanche danger), and affect ecological and
   biogeochemical cycles, precipitation regimes, and the Earth's radiation
   budget. We used a novel modeling approach in which local-scale winds
   were used to drive a high-resolution dust emission model parameterized
   for burned soils to provide a first estimate of post-fire PM emissions.
   The dust emission model was parameterized with dust flux measurements
   from a 2010 fire scar. Here we present a case study to demonstrate the
   ability of the modeling framework to capture the onset and dynamics of a
   post-fire dust event and then use the modeling framework to estimate PM
   emissions from burn scars left by wildfires in U.S. western sagebrush
   landscapes during 2012. Modeled emissions from 1.2 million ha of burned
   soil totaled 32.1 Tg (11.7-352 Tg) of dust as PM10 and 12.8 Tg (4.68-141
   Tg) as PM2.5. Despite the relatively large uncertainties in these
   estimates and a number of underlying assumptions, these first estimates
   of annual post-fire dust emissions suggest that post-fire PM emissions
   could substantially increase current annual PM estimates in the U.S.
   National Emissions Inventory during high fire activity years. Given the
   potential for post-fire scars to be a large source of PM, further
   on-site PM flux measurements are needed to improve emission
   parameterizations and constrain these first estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Global biodiversity is threatened by invasive plant species. Without a
   thorough understanding of effective management strategies, minimizing
   their impacts while improving native species diversity will be
   challenging. Burning in fire-prone landscapes has been successful for
   managing invasive species and increasing native biodiversity, but it is
   unclear how specific fire regimes improve restoration practices in novel
   ecosystems where invasive plants have a similar growth phenology to
   native plants. We investigated fire as a restoration practice in the
   Northern Great Plains to decrease the cover of Kentucky bluegrass Poa
   pratensis (bluegrass), a perennial cool-season invasive grass
   phenologically similar to dominant native cool-season grasses, by 1)
   evaluating season of burn (early-growing season, late-growing season,
   and dormant season) in a field experiment to test differences in plant
   community composition and 2) manipulating fine fuels (3000-5000 kg
   ha(-1)) in an experimental approach to determine the effects of fire on
   plant survivability of selected native grasses and bluegrass. Bluegrass
   cover decreased 27\% on all field burned plots the first year post-fire.
   Three years post-fire, late-growing season and dormant season treatments
   had 35\% less bluegrass, whereas the early-growing season treatment was
   not significantly different from the control. Overall, fire altered the
   native plant community, with native plants more associated with burned
   plots. However, native plant community changes were only evident three
   years post-fire in late-growing season and dormant season burn
   treatments. In the experimental approach, native grasses and bluegrass
   experienced high rates of mortality (40-50\%) at fuel loads above 4000
   kg ha(-1) and heat dosages above 30,000 degrees C.sec, features commonly
   associated with early-growing season burns. Therefore, early-growing
   season burns meant to reduce bluegrass may also impact native plants
   dominant in the region. Invasive species management is complicated in
   novel ecosystems when invasive plants have similar growth phenologies to
   native species. Control efforts should consider how different management
   strategies impact invasive and native plants alike. We found that
   late-growing season and dormant season burns, along with higher fuel
   loads, decreased bluegrass cover. Determining mechanisms of control in
   fire-prone landscapes is a crucial step to improving invasive plant
   control and increasing native biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are a dominant disturbance to boreal forests, and in North
   America, they typically cause widespread tree mortality. Forest fire
   burn severity is often measured at a plot scale using the Composite Burn
   Index (CBI), which was originally developed as a means of assigning
   severity levels to the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) computed from Landsat
   satellite imagery. Our study investigated the potential to map
   biophysical indicators of burn severity (residual green vegetation and
   charred organic surface) at very high (3 cm) resolution, using color
   orthomosaics and vegetation height models derived from UAV-based
   photographic surveys and Structure from Motion methods. These indicators
   were scaled to 30 m resolution Landsat pixel footprints and compared to
   the post-burn NBR (post-NBR) and differenced NBR (dNBR) ratios computed
   from pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery. The post-NBR showed the
   strongest relationship to both the fraction of charred surface
   (exponential R-2 = 0.79) and the fraction of green crown vegetation
   above 5 m (exponential R-2 = 0.81), while the dNBR was more closely
   related to the total green vegetation fraction (exponential R-2 = 0.69).
   Additionally, the UAV green fraction and Landsat indices could
   individually explain more than 50\% of the variance in the overall CBI
   measured in 39 plots. These results provide a proof-of-concept for using
   low-cost UAV photogrammetric mapping to quantify key measures of boreal
   burn severity at landscape scales, which could be used to calibrate and
   assign a biophysical meaning to Landsat spectral indices for mapping
   severity at regional scales.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of an experimental low-intensity fire on the soil seed bank

   produce a population decline of hard-seeded species by the elimination
   of established plants and the lack of a seed germination promotion
   effect was investigated. Consecutive pre- and post-burning soil
   samplings revealed extremely low impact of fire on seed banks. In
   contrast, some specific seed banks increased with fire, probably due to
   a seed rain from fire-opening of capsule fruits. Fire neither promoted
   germination of hard-coated seeds nor affected their viability. Both the
   length of the seed-unproductive juvenile phase and post-fire habitat
   conditions were revealed as critical in determining the recovery of
   hard-seeded species after a low-intensity fire. Species with a short
   life cycle produced seeds in the year subsequent to the disturbance,
   ensuring a progressive moderate recovery from the few individuals which
   emerged after fire. This was particularly true in the southern exposure,
   where other seed-softening factors not exclusively related to fire may
   operate in a more intense way, compensating the null effect on
   germination of the low-fire intensity. For Cistus clusii, with a
   relatively long juvenile-phase span (3 years), low post-fire germination
   coincided with a long seed-unproductive period, which finally overlapped
   with a dramatic seed bank viability depletion (63-68\%). In the northern
   exposure, fire resulted in a complete extinction of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The Land surface Processes and eXchanges (LPX) model is a fire-enabled

   problems representing fire regimes and vegetative mix in savannas. Here

   ignitions, we introduced a treatment of lightning that allows the
   fraction of ground strikes to vary spatially and seasonally,
   realistically partitions strike distribution between wet and dry days,
   and varies the number of dry days with strikes. Fuel availability and
   moisture content were improved by implementing decomposition rates
   specific to individual plant functional types and litter classes, and
   litter drying rates driven by atmospheric water content. To improve
   water extraction by grasses, we use realistic plant-specific treatments
   of deep roots. To improve fire responses, we introduced adaptive bark
   thickness and post-fire resprouting for tropical and temperate broadleaf
   trees. All improvements are based on extensive analyses of relevant
   observational data sets. We test model performance for Australia, first
   evaluating parameterisations separately and then measuring overall
   behaviour against standard benchmarks. Changes to the lightning
   parameterisation produce a more realistic simulation of fires in
   southeastern and central Australia. Implementation of PFT-specific
   decomposition rates enhances performance in central Australia. Changes
   in fuel drying improve fire in northern Australia, while changes in
   rooting depth produce a more realistic simulation of fuel availability
   and structure in central and northern Australia. The introduction of
   adaptive bark thickness and resprouting produces more realistic fire
   regimes in Australian savannas. We also show that the model simulates
   biomass recovery rates consistent with observations from several
   different regions of the world characterised by resprouting vegetation.

Abstract = {{The effects of drought on soil dynamics after fire are poorly known,
   particularly its long-term (i.e., years) legacy effects once rainfall
   returns to normal. Understanding this is particularly important for
   nutrient-poor soils in semi-arid regions affected by fire, in which
   rainfall is projected to decrease with climate change. Here, we studied
   the effects of post-fire drought and its legacy on soil microbial
   community structure and functionality in a Cistus-Erica shrubland
   (Spain). Rainfall total and patterns were experimentally modified to
   produce an unburned control (natural rainfall) and four burned
   treatments: control (natural rainfall), historical control (long-term
   average rainfall), moderate drought (percentile 8 historical rainfall, 5
   months of drought per year), and severe drought (percentile 2, 7 months
   of drought). Soil nutrients and microbial community composition
   (ester-linked fatty acid approach) and functionality (enzyme activities
   and C mineralization rate) were monitored during the first 4 years after
   fire under rainfall treatments, plus two additional ones without them
   (six post-fire years). We found that the recovery of burned soils was
   lower under drought. Post-fire drought increased nitrate in the short
   term and reduced available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, soil
   organic matter, enzyme activities, and carbon mineralization rate.
   Moreover, drought decreased soil total microbial biomass and fungi, with
   bacteria becoming relatively more abundant. Two years after
   discontinuing the drought treatments, the drought legacy was significant
   for available phosphorus and enzyme activities. Although microbial
   biomass did not show any drought legacy effect, the proportion of fungi
   and bacteria (mainly gram-positive) did, being lower and higher,
   respectively, in former drought-treated plots. We show that drought has
   an important impact on soil processes, and that some of its effects
   persist for at least 2 years after the drought ended. Therefore, drought
   and its legacy effects can be important for modeling biogeochemical
   processes in burned soils under future climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how alternative vegetation types co-exist in a landscape
   is important in managing for biodiversity within an ecosystem. In
   California, mixed conifer forest is often interrupted by stands of
   shrubs known as montane chaparral. The development of chaparral stands
   following recent high severity or stand-replacing wildfires in mixed
   conifer forests has been well documented. Fire has been excluded from
   mixed conifer forests for over a century, and fuel loads are at
   historically high levels across much of this landscape. Despite
   contemporary post-fire research on mixed conifer forest, little is known
   about montane chaparral fire regimes or forest-chaparral dynamics in an
   ecosystem with a functioning fire regime. This study quantifies fire
   regimes in chaparral and adjacent forest and determines how chaparral
   responded to fire before fire exclusion in Lassen Volcanic National
   Park, California, a park that was never logged. Chaparral stems
   regenerated immediately after high severity fires in the 19th and early
   20th century, and stem recruitment continued until the present. Fire
   return intervals in chaparral were longer than in adjacent forest (25
   years vs. 11 years), and chaparral fires occurred during drier,
   potentially more extreme conditions. The apparent maintenance of stands
   of chaparral by less frequent, more severe fires suggests chaparral
   represents a self-reinforcing alternative stable state to forest.
   Following fire exclusion, chaparral stands gradually converted to forest
   as trees progressively invaded chaparral from the forest edge. Forest
   developing in chaparral is denser and more fir-enriched than the
   adjacent forest, similar to the understory that develops beneath a pine
   overstory following fire exclusion. Replacement of chaparral by forest
   reduces mixed conifer forest landscape diversity. However, the mixture
   of shrubs and trees in long unburned former chaparral is likely to burn
   with high severity effects in a subsequent fire. Since chaparral is also
   establishing in recent, very large high severity burn patches, chaparral
   extent may be expanding in the new configuration. If the decades needed
   for trees to invade from forest at the edge of severe burns exceed the
   fire return interval, chaparral may emerge as an alternative stable
   state to forest. Consequently, developing management strategies to
   increase resilience of mixed conifer forests to altered fire regimes is
   a pressing management challenge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Questions: Does post-fire plant succession in boreal bogs vary
   microtopographically and are successional patterns reproducible among
   similar microtopographic features? Does succession preserve
   microtopography post-fire?
   Location: Boreal bog peatlands near Sinkhole Lake and Athabasca,
   Alberta, Canada.
   Methods: We assessed microtopographic variation in post-fire plant
   community succession through stratigraphic macrofossil analysis of bog
   soil cores collected from high (hummock) and low (hollow) positions. We
   conducted vegetation surveys and collected soil cores from ten hummocks
   and hollows in each bog. Pre-fire microtopographic status was inferred
   based on floral composition and compared to current microtopography.
   Results: Hollow vegetation was more variable than hummocks, both in
   present composition and post-fire succession. The successional
   trajectory of current hummocks was relatively uniform, showing
   relatively rapid shifts to Sphagnum fuscum dominance, but varied greatly
   in hollows. Hollows, although compositionally variable, were typically
   perpetuated following fire, while hummocks had an approximately equal
   chance of being perpetuated or becoming hollows.
   Conclusions: Greater compositional variability at lower microtopographic
   positions, both spatially and temporally, is most likely due to the
   ability of hollows to support a wider range of species and greater
   susceptibility to severe disturbance. Likewise, spatial variability in
   fire severity appears to be responsible for perpetuation or change in
   microtopographic status. favouring the creation of hollows over

Abstract = {{Tree mortality is an important outcome of many forest fires. Extensive
   tree injuries from fire may lead directly to mortality, but
   environmental and biological stressors may also contribute to tree
   death. However, there is little evidence showing how the combined
   effects of two common stressors, drought and competition, influence
   post-fire mortality. Geographically broad observations of three common
   western coniferous trees subjected to prescribed fire showed the
   likelihood of post-fire mortality was related to intermediate-term (10
   yr) pre-fire average radial growth, an important component of tree
   vigor. Path analysis showed that indices of competition and drought
   stress prior to fire can be described in terms of joint effects on
   growth, indirectly affecting post-fire mortality. Our results suggest
   that the conditions that govern the relationship between growth and
   mortality in unburned stands may also apply to post-fire environments.
   Thus, biotic and abiotic changes that affect growth negatively (e.g.,
   drought stress) or positively (e.g., growth releases following thinning
   treatments) prior to fire may influence expressed fire severity,
   independent of fire intensity (e.g., heat flux, residence time). These
   relationships suggest that tree mortality may increase under stressful
   climatic or stand conditions even if fire behavior remains constant.}},

Title = {{Fire characteristics and environmental conditions shape plant
   communities via regeneration strategy}},
Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is altering disturbance regimes outside historical norms,
   which can impact biodiversity by selecting for plants with particular
   traits. The relative impact of disturbance characteristics on plant
   traits and community structure may be mediated by environmental
   gradients. We aimed to understand how wildfire impacted understory plant
   communities and plant regeneration strategies along gradients of
   environmental conditions and wildfire characteristics in boreal forests.
   We established 207 plots (60 m(2)) in recently burned stands and 133
   plots in mature stands with no recent fire history in comparable
   gradients of stand type, site moisture (drainage) and soil organic layer
   (SOL) depth in two ecozones in Canada's Northwest Territories. At each
   plot, we recorded all vascular plant taxa in the understory and measured
   the regeneration strategy (seeder, resprouter, survivor) in burned
   plots, along with seedbed conditions (mineral soil and bryophyte cover).
   Dispersal, longevity and growth form traits were determined for each
   taxon. Fire characteristics measured included proportion of pre-fire SOL
   combusted (fire severity), date of burn (fire seasonality) and pre-fire
   stand age (time following fire). Results showed understory community
   composition was altered by fire. However, burned and mature stands had
   similar plant communities in wet sites with deep SOL. In the burned
   plots, regeneration strategies were determined by fire severity,
   drainage and pre- and post-fire SOL depth. Resprouters were more common
   in wet sites with deeper SOL and lower fire severity, while seeders were
   associated with drier sites with thinner SOL and greater fire severity.
   This led to drier burned stands being compositionally different from
   their mature counterparts and seedbed conditions were important. Our
   study highlights the importance of environment-wildfire interactions in
   shaping plant regeneration strategies and patterns of understory plant
   community structure across landscapes, and the overriding importance of
   SOL depth and site drainage in mediating fire severity, plant
   regeneration and community structure.}},

Abstract = {{Very high-severity fires are a component of many fire-prone ecosystems,

   such systems are likely to have adapted to persist under a fire regime
   that includes high-severity fires. We examined how fire severity affects
   post-fire recruitment and residual seed banks of Acacia species and
   whether severity may affect plant responses to fire intervals. Nine
   sites of either high or low burn severity were identified after a
   large-scale mixed-severity fire in Warrumbungle National Park,
   south-eastern Australia. Transects were used to sample above-ground
   woody plant density. Seed bank size was surveyed by soil extraction from
   two depths and manual searching for seeds. Residual soil seed bank and
   recruitment were compared across the two burn severities. Acacia
   seedling density was higher in areas burnt at high severity, indicating
   that increased severity triggers increased germination from the seed
   bank. Size of residual seed bank was smaller after high-severity fire,
   but varied between species, with few Acacia cheelii seeds remaining
   despite high above-ground abundance. In contrast, A. penninervis
   retained a small residual seed bank. There was little evidence of
   negative effects on populations of Acacia species after high-severity
   burns. However, we found that high fire severity may impact on the
   ability of a species to persist in response to a subsequent short fire
   interval. Fire management for maintaining biodiversity needs to consider
   other key aspects of the fire regime, including severity and season,
   rather than focusing solely on fire frequency.}},

Title = {{The diversity of post-fire regeneration strategies in the cerrado ground
   layer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Disentangling species strategies that confer resilience to natural
   disturbances is key to conserving and restoring savanna ecosystems. Fire
   is a recurrent disturbance in savannas, and savanna vegetation is highly
   adapted to and often dependent on fire. However, although the woody
   component of tropical savannas is well studied, we still do not
   understand how ground-layer plant communities respond to fire, limiting
   conservation and management actions. We investigated the effects of
   prescribed fire on community structure and composition, and evaluated
   which traits are involved in plant community regeneration after fire in
   the cerrado ground layer. We assessed traits related to species
   persistence and colonization capacity after fire, including resprouter
   type, underground structure, fire-induced flowering, regeneration
   strategy and growth form. We searched for functional groups related to
   response to fire, to shed light on the main strategies of post-fire
   recovery among species in the ground layer. Fire changed ground-layer
   community structure and composition in the short term, leading to
   greater plant species richness, population densities and increasing bare
   soil, compared with unburned communities. Eight months after fire,
   species abundance did not differ from pre-disturbance values for 86\% of
   the species, demonstrating the resilience of this layer to fire. Only
   one ruderal species was disadvantaged by fire and 13\% of the species
   benefited. Rapid recovery of soil cover by native vegetation in burned
   areas was driven by species with high capacity to resprout and spread
   vegetatively. Recovery of the savanna ground-layer community, as a
   whole, resulted from a combination of different species traits. We
   summarized these traits into five large groups, encompassing key
   strategies involved in ground-layer regeneration after fire. Synthesis.
   Fire dramatically changes the ground layer of savanna vegetation in the
   short term, but the system is highly resilient, quickly recovering the
   pre-fire state. Recovery involves different strategies, which we
   categorized into five functional groups of plant
   species:grasses,seeders,bloomers,undergroundersandresprouters. Knowledge
   of these diverse strategies should be used as a tool to assess
   conservation and restoration status of fire-resilient ecosystems in the

   Pennell (Fabaceae) up to two years post-fire. C. keyensis is an endemic
   understory plant of pine rockland, a fire-dependent ecosystem of the

   We found fire intensity had significant effects on reproduction in the

Abstract = {{Stand-replacing fires influence soil nitrogen availability and microbial
   community composition, which may in turn mediate post-fire successional
   dynamics and nutrient cycling. However, fires create patchiness at both
   local and landscape scales and do not result in consistent patterns of

   the spatial structure of microbial communities in forest stands recently
   affected by stand-replacing fire and (2) determine whether microbial
   variables aid predictions of in situ net nitrogen mineralization rates
   in recently burned stands. The study was conducted in lodgepole pine
   (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir
   (Picea engelmannii/Abies lasiocarpa) forest stands that burned during
   summer 2000 in Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA). Using a fully
   probabilistic spatial process model and Bayesian kriging, the spatial
   structure of microbial lipid abundance and fungi-to-bacteria ratios were
   found to be spatially structured within plots two years following fire
   (for most plots, autocorrelation range varied from 1.5 to 10.5 m).
   Congruence of spatial patterns among microbial variables, in situ net N
   mineralization, and cover variables was evident. Stepwise regression
   resulted in significant models of in situ net N mineralization and
   included variables describing fungal and bacterial abundance, although
   explained variance was low (R-2<,0.29). Unraveling complex spatial

Title = {{Trust, acceptance, and citizen-agency interactions after large fires:
   influences on planning processes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{137-147}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires have increased in number and size in recent years, making
   post-fire forest management an increasingly important topic.
   Citizen-agency interactions, citizen trust, and citizen acceptance of
   management strategies are central to successful planning and
   decision-making in these settings. In this study, citizen opinions from
   the attentive public are evaluated in two locations near recent fires in
   Oregon: the 2003 Bear and Booth Complex Fires and the 2002 Biscuit Fire.
   Results suggest an agency's commitment to long-term interactions with
   citizens influences citizen trust in the agencies and acceptance of
   post-fire management strategies. There is broad acceptance for several
   post-fire management strategies (i.e. erosion control, replanting,
   reseeding). However, acceptance is highly dependent on trustworthy
   relations. Further, results suggest it is not enough to simply offer
   opportunities for public engagement; citizens need to feel that these
   activities were meaningful opportunities to participate. Although
   results differed between locations, overall the majority of respondents
   did not agree with how the local Forest Service and Bureau of Land
   Management handled forest planning after recent fires. Findings from
   this research indicate that positive citizen-agency relations need to be
   long-term and developed well before a fire occurs if post-fire actions
   are to be supported by communities.}},

Abstract = {{We report a landscape-scale study investigating the responses of small

   Vertebrates were surveyed on 26 study grids aged from 0 to >25 years

   assemblages showed markedly different responses to each other with
   respect to post-fire vegetation succession. Lizard community composition
   could be arrayed along a single continuum of vegetation structure and
   conformed to a directional model for post-fire succession. In contrast,
   small mammal assemblages could not be arrayed along a continuum of
   post-fire vegetation succession. Geographical locality, rainfall,
   seedbank density and cattle grazing were prominent correlates of mammal
   assemblage structure. We propose a non-equilibrium state-and-transition
   model to describe small mammal community dynamics. This model has four
   temporal or geographical states that are characterized by different
   abundances of small mammals, and eight transitions that prompt shifts
   from one state to another. The model can be used to describe assemblage
   composition and identify areas or time periods when management

Abstract = {{Changes in land management and reductions in fire frequency have enabled
   woody species to increase in grasslands worldwide. Nevertheless, fire is
   rarely eliminated from grasslands, and for shrubs to survive, they must
   be able cope with fire and replace aboveground structures. Because new
   shoots may have more available solar radiation, greater root : shoot
   ratios, and thus more resources available belowground after fire
   compared to undisturbed shrub communities, we hypothesized that carbon.
   nutrient. and water relations may be enhanced in sterns compared to
   those in an undisturbed grassland. However, this same post-fire resource
   Pulse stimulates the grasses and may intensify competitive interactions
   between shrubs and grasses. To test these predictions, we measured
   seasonal patterns in net photosynthesis (A), predawn xylem pressure
   potentials (XPP), leaf nitrogen (N) content, and productivity of Cornus
   drummondii shoots from shrub patches (islands) of different sizes in
   mesic grasslands burned annually, burned infrequently. and protected
   from fire. Seasonal average A was 20\% higher (P = 0.016) in burned than
   in unburned shrubs, regardless of island size. Shrubs in burned sites
   also produced shoots with higher leaf N than unburned shrubs, and N
   content was higher in leaves from small islands compared to large
   islands (P < 0.0001). Burning caused a decrease in late summer predawn
   XPP in small islands (-3.1 MPa). whereas burned large islands did not
   differ from unburned shrubs. Post-fire productivity of new shoots was
   significantly greater compared to shoots in unburned sites. These
   results indicate that a transient period of high resource availability
   after fire allows for increased growth and rapid recovery of grassland
   Shrubs. Thus, although fire has a negative effect on aboveground biomass
   of shrubs. the post-fire increases in resource availability, which
   enhance growth in the dominant grasses, are also important for recovery
   of woody species.}},

Abstract = {{In Andean Patagonia, Argentina, severe wildfires produce high mortality
   in Austrocedrus chilensis forests. Owing to its high timber quality, A.
   chilensis trees are generally salvage logged right after wildfires.
   Post-logged areas result in open, denuded stands with low herbaceous or
   shrub cover, which precludes natural A. chilensis regeneration. In
   severely burned A. chilensis stands, we determined how different site
   conditions (salvage logging, SL, and without logging, WL), and the
   combination of different methods of control of above- and belowground
   competition and micro-environmental factors (incident radiation, soil
   temperature and soil moisture) affected survival, growth and hydric
   status of planted A seedlings. Two growing seasons after plantation,
   seedling survival was lower than 10\% at SL sites, whereas it was near
   90\% at WL sites. Four seasons after establishment, and regardless of
   competition treatments, no seedlings survived at SL sites, whereas over
   75\% survived at WL sites. Radiation attenuation by canopy of WL sites
   benefitted A. chilensis seedling survival, and no additional control of
   early successional herbaceous species should be necessary to attain high
   seedling survival 4 years after restoration. Selective logging, by
   leaving similar to 50\% of burned snags, and active restoration
   practices, may help reconcile economic needs of society and ecological
   requirements of A. chilensis for recovering former structure and

Abstract = {{At Lamto, little is known about animal community responses to habitat
   variability resulting from fires and the mosaic pattern of the
   vegetation in general and in particular about that of termites which
   play key roles in this ecosystem. With a standardized method, data were
   collected on termites from four habitats differing in their vegetation
   cover and fire-history: annually burned savanna, savanna woodland,
   forest island and gallery forest. A range of environmental variables was
   measured and correlated with species abundances. The number of termite
   species collected in the savanna woodland was very close to that found
   in the gallery forest while the forest island was the richest habitat.
   The species richness of the savanna woodland and forest island seemed
   partly due to their heterogeneous and transitional vegetation structures
   and variable food resources. With regard to the fire-history of
   habitats, Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis offers an
   explanation for differences in the patterns of habitat-specific species
   richness. Variation in species abundances was significantly correlated
   with only two environmental variables (soil pH and woody plant species
   richness). The pH appeared as the most influential factor for
   fungus-growers while tree invasion in the savanna strongly reduces the
   abundance of grass-feeding species (e.g. Trinervitermes geminatus).
   Although not significantly correlated with species abundances, soil
   carbon showed a positive correlation with the dominant soil-feeder
   Basidentitermes potens. As for wood-feeders, they were not strongly
   correlated with woody plant species richness; this fact might be linked
   to their use for other sources of nourishment. Overall, it appears that
   habitat variability in the Lamto reserve contributes to the maintenance
   of different subsets of the termite community.}},

Pages = {{147-157}},
Abstract = {{Using Landsat imagery, this study was conducted to evaluate a fire
   disturbance that occurred in Canada's Grasslands National Park on 27
   April 2013. We used spectral indices (e.g. Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR)
   and Mid-infrared Burn Index (MIRBI)) derived from Landsat images to
   evaluate burn severity and to analyse the vegetation recovery process. A
   field survey was conducted to assess burn severity, which we used to
   evaluate the performance of spectral indices. Responses of the
   vegetation community to the fire disturbance were also investigated
   during the field campaign. Results show that the selected spectral
   indices performed differently for evaluating burn severity, but MIRBI
   performed best, likely due to its ability to discriminate post-fire
   residuals. Severely burned areas were distributed along a river where a
   larger amount of senesced biomass had accumulated before the fire. The
   semiarid grasslands showed a strong resilience to fire disturbance, and
   vegetation recovery was likely influenced by burn severity and water
   availability. Different vegetation types (e.g. grass, trees and shrubs)
   had distinct recovery rates and, thus, fire influences plant community
   development. The fire disturbance changed the composition of grass
   species in the burned area and also promoted invasion by non-native

Abstract = {{In the southwestern United States, climate change and climate-fire

   griseus) distribution on the sky island of the San Bernardino Mountains
   (California, USA) and determined post-fire differential use of burn
   severity in a landscape modified by fire. Gray squirrel presence was
   related to habitat features important for this species' ecology and
   behavior, especially those associated with mature forests. The species
   was detected in areas with a high percentage of conifers that provide
   both an important food resource and good branches and cavities for nest
   sites. Gray squirrels occurred in all burn severities but occurred more
   in low and high severity sites than unburned sites. These results

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Models of vegetation dynamics framed as testable hypotheses provide
   powerful tools for predicting vegetation change in response to
   contemporary disturbances or climate change. Synthesizing existing
   information and applying new data, we develop a conceptual model of
   vegetation states and transitions for the previously overlooked
   woodlands dominated by obligate-seeder eucalypts of dry to semi-arid
   south-western Australia. These comprise the largest extant temperate
   woodland globally, are uniquely dominated by a high diversity of
   obligate-seeder eucalypts (55 taxa), but are under threat from wildfire.
   Our conceptual model incorporates four critical ecological processes
   that also distinguish obligate-seeder woodlands from temperate woodlands
   dominated by resprouting eucalypts: (i) a lack of well-protected
   epicormic buds results in major disturbances (prominently fire) being
   stand-replacing. The pre-disturbance tree cohort is killed, followed by
   dense post-disturbance recruitment from seed shed from a serotinous seed
   bank; (ii) competition between saplings leads to self-thinning over a
   multi-century timeframe, with surviving individuals having great
   longevity (regularly >400years); (iii) multiple processes limit
   recruitment in the absence of stand-replacement disturbances, leading to
   frequent single-cohort stands. However, unlike the few other
   obligate-seeder eucalypt communities, trickle recruitment in very
   long-unburnt stands can facilitate indefinite community persistence in
   the absence of stand-replacement disturbances; and (iv) discontinuous
   fuels, relatively low understorey flammability (low grass and often high
   chenopod cover) and topographic barriers to fire (salt lakes) allow
   mature woodlands to persist for centuries without burning. Notably
   though, evidence suggests that flammability peaks at intermediate times
   since fire, establishing a flammability bottleneck' (or landscape fire
   trap) through which regenerating woodlands must pass. Our model provides
   a framework to support management to conserve obligate-seeder eucalypt
   woodlands. Research into reasons for exceptional tree heights relative
   to ecosystem productivity, the evolution of diverse and dominant
   obligate-seeder eucalypts, the paucity of grass, and the recent spatial
   distribution of fires, will further inform conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the characteristics of understorey regeneration on two sites
   with different fire history in a mature Pinus sylvestris forest in
   eastern Finland. The study area was a 4-ha plot, which was divided into
   two parts based on fire history analysis. In one part the last fire
   event was a stand-replacing fire in the early 19(th) century, after
   which the whole stand regenerated, while the other part of the study
   plot was subsequently burnt by a surface fire in 1906. Understorey P.
   sylvestris individuals were much more abundant in the area of the 1906
   burn compared to the old burn. In both areas the size frequency
   distribution of living trees was bimodal, with frequency peaks at the <
   5 cm and 30-150 cm height classes. In the old burn small understorey
   trees were mainly associated with microsites created by treefall
   disturbances while in the 1906 burn most small understorey trees
   occurred on vegetation-covered microsites. This indicates that with
   increasing time since last fire establishment of new understorey trees
   becomes more restricted by the availability of microsites created by
   treefall disturbances. In both areas the proportion of vigorous small
   understorey trees was highest on decayed wood. In the older burn
   uprooted pits and mounds also had a significant proportion of healthy
   small understorey trees, while the majority of trees classified as
   seriously weakened or dying were growing on microhabitats characterized
   by undisturbed vegetation. Ripley's K-function analyses showed that
   spatial distribution of understorey trees was clustered in both areas in
   all microsite types and clustering at small scales was most pronounced
   in understorey trees growing in uprooted spots or in association with
   decayed wood. The bivariate analysis showed a significant repulsion
   effect between large trees and understorey trees at intermediate spatial
   scales, indicating that competition had an effect on understorey tree
   distribution and this effect was more pronounced in the younger burn.
   The analysis suggests that in Pinus sylvestris forests the abundance,
   quality and spatial pattern of understorey tree population may vary
   considerably as a function of disturbance history.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{1375-1381}},
Abstract = {{To fully understand the carbon (C) cycle impacts of forest fires, both C
   emissions during the fire and post-disturbance fluxes need to be
   considered. The latter are dominated by soil surface CO2 flux (F-s),
   which is still subject to large uncertainties. Fire is generally
   regarded as the most important factor influencing succession in the
   boreal forest biome and fire dependant species such as jack pine are
   widespread. In May 2007, we took concurrent F-s and soil temperature
   (T-s) measurements in boreal jack pine fire scars aged between 0 and 59
   years since fire. To allow comparisons between scars, we adjusted F-s
   for T-s (F-s(T)) using a Q(10) of 2. Mean F-s(T) ranged from 0.56 (+/-
   0.30 sd) to 1.94 (+/- 0.74 sd) mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Our results
   indicate a difference in mean F-s(T) between recently burned (4 to 8
   days post fire) and non-burned mature (59 years since fire) forest (P <
   0.001), though no difference was detected between recently burned (4 to
   8 days post fire) and non-burned young (16 years since fire) forest (P =
   0.785). There was a difference in mean F-s(T) between previously young
   (16 years since fire) and intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars
   that were both subject to fire in 2007 (P < 0.001). However, there was
   no difference in mean F-s(T) between mature (59 years since fire) and
   intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars that were both subjected
   to fire in 2007 (P = 0.226). Furthermore, there was no difference in
   mean F-s(T) between mature (59 years since fire) and young scars (16
   years since fire) that were both subjected to fire in 2007 (P = 0.186).
   There was an increase in F-s(T) with time since fire for the
   chronosequence 0, 16 and 59 years post fire (P < 0.001). Our results
   lead us to hypothesise that the autotrophic:heterotrophic soil
   respiration ratio increases over post-fire successional time in boreal
   jack pine systems, though this should be explored in future research.
   The results of this study contribute to a better quantitative
   understanding of F-s in boreal jack pine fire scars and will facilitate
   meta-analyses of F-s in fire scar chronosequences.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) woodlands are replacing
   low elevation (< 2100 m) quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.)
   stands in the northern Great Basin. Restoring aspen woodlands is
   important because they provide wildlife habitat for many species and
   contain a high diversity of understory shrubs and herbaceous species. We
   measured herbaceous cover, density, and diversity for 15 years following
   two juniper control treatments in aspen woodlands. Treatments included
   cutting one-third of mature juniper trees followed by early fall burning
   (Fall), cutting two-thirds of the juniper followed by early spring
   burning (Spring), and untreated woodlands (Control). Junipers were
   selectivly cut to increase dry surface fuels to carry fire and kill the
   remaining conifers. The Fall treatment resulted in significant initial
   reductions in herbaceous cover and a long-term reduction in perennial
   forb cover and diversity. Herbaceous recovery in the Fall treatment was
   dominated by non-native species which represented about 68\% of total
   herbaceous cover. By the end of the study the main non natives in the
   Fall treatment were Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and cheatgrass
   (Bromus tectorum L.). In contrast, native perennials in Spring and
   Control treatments represented, on average, above 60\% of total
   herbaceous cover. Herbaceous cover in the Spring treatment increased and
   was greater than the Fall treatment and the Control. Perennial forb
   cover in the Spring treatment was 2- and 6-times greater than Control
   and Fall treatments, respectively. Perennial forb density was about 7
   times greater in the Spring than Fall treatment. Because of lower fire
   severity, spring burning resulted in greater recovery of the herbaceous
   layer while maintaining a more diverse native understory than fall
   burning. The severe fire effects from fall burning aspen woodlands
   probably requires reseeding of native perennials to maintain understory

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic understorey fires affect large areas of tropical forest,
   yet their effects on woody plant regeneration post-fire remain poorly
   understood. We examined the effects of repeated experimental fires on
   woody stem (less than 1 cm at base) mortality, recruitment, species
   diversity, community similarity and regeneration mode (seed versus
   sprout) in Mato Grosso, Brazil. From 2004 to 2010, forest plots (50 ha)
   were burned twice (B2) or five times (B5), and compared with an unburned
   control (B0). Stem density recovered within a year after the first burn
   (initial density: 12.4-13.2 stems m(-2)), but after 6 years, increased
   mortality and decreased regeneration-primarily of seedlings-led to a 63
   per cent and 85 per cent reduction in stem density in B2 and B5,
   respectively. Seedlings and sprouts across plots in 2010 displayed
   remarkable community similarity owing to shared abundant species.
   Although the dominant surviving species were similar across plots, a
   major increase in sprouting occurred-almost three-and fourfold greater
   in B2 and B5 than in B0. In B5, 29 species disappeared and were replaced
   by 11 new species often present along fragmented forest edges. By 2010,
   the annual burn regime created substantial divergence between the
   seedling community and the initial adult tree community (greater than or
   equal to 20 cm dbh). Increased droughts and continued anthropogenic
   ignitions associated with frontier land uses may promote high-frequency
   fire regimes that may substantially alter regeneration and therefore
   successional processes.}},

Abstract = {{Tree encroachment is one of the primary conservation issues in
   Calluna-heathlands, a priority habitat in Europe. Improving
   understanding of the ecological factors that trigger transitions to
   woodlands is key to developing strategies for heathlands management. The
   irrational use of fire has been recognized as one of the key factors
   that drives the loss of heathlands of north-west Italy. The effect of
   high frequency pastoral burning on the replacement of heathlands by
   grasslands has been documented by several studies. The relationship
   between fire and tree encroachment is less clear. The paper examines the
   effect of the fire regime on the encroachment of Populus tremula L. and
   Betula pendula Roth. in the heathland. The study was carried out at the
   Managed Nature Reserve of Vauda (7 degrees 41' E, 45 degrees 13' N),
   which includes one of the most valuable heathlands of north-western
   Italy. The experimental design consisted of analysing the age structure,
   dendrometric variables and the species composition of three aspen and
   birch stands, circular-shaped and isolated within the heathland matrix.
   From 1986 to 2009 all stands experienced the same fire regime due to
   pastoral burning. Wildfires of similar behaviour occurred in 1998, 2003
   and 2008 and determined the stand structure observed in 2009. The
   results evidenced that fire acts as a catalyst not only for seedlings
   establishment, as previously documented, but also for woodland expansion
   in the heathland. After initial establishment, stands showed a
   concentric encroachment dynamic, mainly due to aspen root suckering
   after post-fire stem mortality, whose steps of expansion coincided with
   the return interval of wildfires. Moreover, aspen determined the loss of
   heathland characteristic species, whose relative abundances were
   inversely correlated to aspen density along a gradient from the stands
   centre to the surrounding heathland. The regulation of current burning
   practices by prescribed burning, integrated with rational grazing,
   presents the next research questions to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{In boreal forest ecosystems fire, fungi and bacteria, and their

   study we measured enzymatic activities, litter decomposition rates,
   carbon stocks and fungal and microbial biomasses in a boreal subarctic
   coniferous forest on a four age classes of non-stand replacing fire
   chronosequence (2, 42, 60 and 152 years after the fire). The results
   show that microbial activity recovered slowly after fire and the
   decomposition of new litter was affected by the disturbance. The percent
   mass loss of Scots pine litter increased with time from the last fire.
   Slow litter decomposition during the first post-fire years accelerates
   soil organic matter accumulation that is essential for the recovery of
   soil biological activities. Fire reduced the enzymatic activity across
   all the enzyme types measured. Carbon-degrading, chitin-degrading and
   phosphorus-dissolving enzymes showed different responses with the time
   elapsed since the fire disturbance. Microbial and enzymatic activity
   took decades before recovering to the levels observed in old forest

Abstract = {{Fire is a natural disturbance that shapes many ecosystems. In semi-arid
   regions, where high temperatures and low soil moisture limit nutrient
   cycling and plant growth, fire is critical to supply nutrients and drive
   vegetation composition. We examined soil chemical and biological
   properties to assess the short-term impacts of wildfire and prescribed
   fires on soil functioning in semi-arid regions of Texas. Better
   understanding of soil organic matter transformation and nutrient cycling
   processes will aid land managers in predicting ecosystem recovery
   response post-fire. Soil samples were collected following both
   prescribed grassland fires in June of 2009 in Lubbock, TX and the April
   2012 Livermore Ranch Complex Fire located in the Davis Mountains, TX.
   Prescribed fire samples (0-2.5 cm) were collected within six h prior to
   burning and again at 0.5, 24, 48, and 168 h post-fire to experimentally
   examine short-term influences of fire and fire frequency (1x vs. 2x) on
   soil carbon dynamics, inorganic nitrogen, and microbial community
   composition. Wildfire samples (0-5 cm) were collected two and six months
   following the wildfire. We evaluated the effects of three burn severity
   levels and sampled under three tree species (Juniperus deppeana, Pinus
   cembroides, and Quercus grisea). Within 0.5 h of the prescribed fire,
   CO2 flux, NH4+-N concentration and total microbial biomass (as estimated
   by total fatty acid methyl esters) increased. A shift in the microbial
   community from a predominance of fungi to Gram positive bacteria
   occurred immediately following the fire. Chemical shifts were short
   lived (decreased within 24 h), but the biotic shift to a dominance of
   Gram negative bacteria and actinomycetes was measured in samples
   collected after 168 h. Soil pH and NH4+-N concentration increased at two
   and six months following the wildfire. In contrast, soil organic matter
   content decreased at two months post wildfire which, in combination of
   abiotic conditions such as low moisture content (<3.3\%), resulted in
   reduced soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity. Increased soil
   moisture six months post fire created more favorable conditions for
   nitrification resulting in increased NO3--N concentration (0.8 to 36.1
   mg NO3--N kg(-1) soil), particularly following high severity fire.
   Prescribed fire did not have lasting impacts on soil nutrients, but both
   prescribed and wildfire resulted in increased NH4+-N, shifts in
   microbial community structure and decreased in microbial biomass. While
   the increase in nitrogen maybe be beneficial to the plant growth and
   revegetation, the loss of microbial biomass may have far reaching
   implications to the overall sustainability of the soils in these
   systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plant biomass accumulation and productivity are important determinants
   of ecosystem carbon (C) balance during post-fire succession. In boreal
   black spruce (Picea mariana) forests near Delta Junction, Alaska, we
   quantified aboveground plant biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP)
   for 4 years after a 1999 wildfire in a well-drained (dry) site, and also
   across a dry and a moderately well-drained (mesic) chronosequence of
   sites that varied in time since fire (2 to similar to 116 years). Four
   years after fire, total biomass at the 1999 burn site had increased
   exponentially to 160 +/- 21 g m(-2) (mean +/- 1SE) and vascular ANPP had
   recovered to 138 +/- 32 g m(-2) y(-1), which was not different than that
   of a nearby unburned stand (160 +/- 48 g m(-2) y(-1)) that had similar
   pre-fire stand structure and understory composition. Production in the
   young site was dominated by re-sprouting graminoids, whereas production
   in the unburned site was dominated by black spruce. On the dry and mesic
   chronosequences, total biomass pools, including overstory and understory
   vascular and non-vascular plants, and lichens, increased logarithmically
   (dry) or linearly (mesic) with increasing site age, reaching a maximum
   of 2469 +/- 180 (dry) and 4008 +/- 233 g m(-2) (mesic) in mature stands.
   Biomass differences were primarily due to higher tree density in the
   mesic sites because mass per tree was similar between sites. ANPP of
   vascular and non-vascular plants increased linearly over time in the
   mesic chronosequence to 335 +/- 68 g m(-2) y(-1) in the mature site, but
   in the dry chronosequence it peaked at 410 +/- 43 g m(-2) y(-1) in a
   15-year-old stand dominated by deciduous trees and shrubs. Key factors
   regulating biomass accumulation and production in these ecosystems
   appear to be the abundance and composition of re-sprouting species early
   in succession, the abundance of deciduous trees and shrubs in
   intermediate aged stands, and the density of black spruce across all
   stand ages. A better understanding of the controls over these factors
   will help predict how changes in climate and fire regime will affect the
   carbon balance of Interior Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{There is increased interest in the use of summer-season fires to limit

   fires, repeated summer fires, and clipping (to simulate grazing) on
   aboveground total yield, live yield, and percentage of live tissue Of
   C(3) Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha {[}Trin. \& Rupr.] Pohl.),
   and C(4) buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides {[}Nutt.] Engelm.) in 2
   experiments. Monospecific patches of each species were exposed to 1 of 3
   fire treatments (no-fire, 2 winter fires in 3 years, or 2 summer fires
   in 3 years) and 1 of 2 clip treatments (no clip or clip once each
   spring). Experiment I evaluated effects of fire without grazing or
   clipping on late-growing season (late-season) yields. Late-season total
   yield of both species recovered from winter and summer fires within 1 or
   2 growing seasons post-fire. By 3 years post-fire, Texas wintergrass
   late-season total yield was 2 times greater in the summer fire treatment
   than the winter fire or no-fire treatments, and buffalograss late-season
   total yield was 3 times greater in summer and winter fire treatments
   than in the no-fire treatment. Experiment 2 evaluated combined effects
   of fire and clipping the previous spring on spring-season yields.
   Clipping alone or with fire (summer or winter) reduced Texas wintergrass
   yields on more sample dates than occurred with buffalograss. By 3 years
   post-fire, buffalograss spring total yield was greater in all fire and
   fire + clip treatments than in the clip only or untreated controls.
   Results suggest: 1) both species were tolerant of summer fire, 2) fire
   in either season with or without clipping stimulated buffalograss
   production, and 3) buffalograss was more tolerant than Texas wintergrass
   to the combined effects of clipping + fire (either season).}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire has become a major disturbance agent in Mediterranean area,
   with Galicia in the north-west of Spain having the most frequent fires.
   In order to combat soil erosion, different post-fire stabilization
   treatments can be applied, like adding different mulch materials. In a
   laboratory experiment we evaluated the effect of adding plant residues,
   commonly used in post-fire rehabilitation (wheat straw, coconut fibre,
   Eucalyptus bark and wood chips), at two different rates on the microbial
   response (respiration, bacterial and fungal growth, using leucine and
   acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation, and biomass and community structure
   by means of phospholipids fatty acid analysis) in an acid forest soil
   affected by a high intensity wildfire. We expected fungal growth to be
   favoured compared to bacterial growth after adding plant material with
   high C/N content, especially at the higher rate. Compared to unburnt
   soil, burnt soil had higher pH (increasing from 4.4 to 5.8) and more
   extractable (available) C, resulting in a relatively higher increase in
   bacterial compared to fungal growth. Adding Eucalyptus residues to burnt
   soil, especially wood chips, favoured fungal growth, especially at the
   higher rate. Straw addition favoured both fungal and bacterial growth
   and was the substrate most available for decomposition, as indicated by
   the higher soil respiration rates. Coconut fibre contained less
   available C. Adding Eucalyptus residue, at both rates, and coconut
   fibres at the high rate, initially inhibited bacterial growth, resulting
   in at most a 14 day lag period. Aiming at high fungal to bacterial
   growth in order to maximize stabilization of soils through fungi suggest
   Eucalyptus residues to the prime choice for further studies on effective
   mulching agents, although coconut fibres, with low degradation rates,
   may also be a suitable choice. Nevertheless, besides aspects related to
   soil quality, additional information concerning the efficiency of these
   materials to control post-fire soil erosion should also be considered
   before their implementation under field conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire
   may help explain how pyrodiversity promotes biodiversity in fire-adapted
   systems. We built on previous research on avian responses to fire by
   investigating how complex effects of bum severity and time since fire
   influenced avian community composition across the northern Sierra
   Nevada, California. We conducted avian point counts from 2009 to 2015 in
   10 fires that burned between 2000 and 2014, resulting in a
   chronosequence of 1-15 yr post-fire. We estimated the effects of burn
   severity, time since fire, non-linear and interacting effects of fire
   severity and time since fire, pre-fire forest conditions, and several
   physiographic parameters on the density of 44 breeding bird species
   using hierarchical distance sampling models. In addition, we fit
   separate models to observations of each species in unburned forest to
   compare species' densities between burned and unburned forests. At least
   one of the non-linear or interaction fire effects was significant for 27
   (61\%) of the 44 bird species. The quadratic effect of time since fire
   was an important predictor of post-fire densities of 20 species,
   illustrating the dynamic nature of this post-wildfire avian community.
   Greater maximum densities were estimated at some combination of burn
   severity and time since fire than in unburned forest for 13 of the 44
   (30\%) species, only one of which reached maximum density following
   low-severity fire. In contrast, all of the 12 species that were more

Abstract = {{After forest fires on the east coast of Korea in 2000, some burnt areas
   were left untreated. Although 80\% of the area was reasonably
   revegetated within 3 months, about 20\% of the area was partially
   vegetated, mainly due to a low density of sprouters and poor growing
   conditions (eroded soil and steep slopes). Three years after the fires,
   the effect of soil conservation measures, such as mulching with wood
   chips, seeding with native plant species and log erosion barriers
   (LEBs), on runoff and soil erosion were examined using runoff plots.
   Wood chip mulching greatly reduced runoff and sediment yields and these
   effects were consistent regardless of the volume of rainfall. Neither
   seeding nor LEBs reduced runoff and sediment yields. No positive or
   negative effects of mulching, seeding or LEBs on ground vegetation cover
   were observed. The ineffectiveness of seeding and LEBs may have been due
   to the steep slope, the failure of germination and establishment of
   seeded plants, and the small diameter of logs. Treating hill slopes with
   mulch should be considered where post-fire regeneration is slow and
   there is an absence of organic material such as litter. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to study the effects of type of fire,

   effects of type of fire (crown-, or surface-fire), prefire-management
   (thinning out of trees and clearing of brush or no such actions) and
   postfire-management (removal of burned trees one year after the fire or
   no such action) on the postfire vegetation were studied during the first
   three years after the fire. Herbaceous plant abundance, species
   richness, and diversity, as well as abundance, growth and density of the
   dominant shrub species (Cistus ladanifer) were measured during the first
   three years after the fire. Our results show that the effects of the
   type of fire on the vegetation were minimal. Prefire-management effects
   were significant on the abundance of herbaceous species, mainly during
   the second and third year after fire, in particular for the Leguminosae
   species. Prefire managed areas were more diverse in species, and
   produced higher plant biomass than unmanaged areas. Postfire-management
   effects on the shrubs and herbs were minimal, except for the
   Leguminosae, which increased their cover where the trees had been
   removed. Plant dynamics were marked by the interaction between
   prefire-management and fire-type through the dynamics of the shrub
   cover. On most occasions, plots that resulted in lower cover of C.
   ladanifer had greater abundance of herbaceous plants and, in particular,
   of the Leguminosae. In general, our results show that irrespective of

Abstract = {{Recent reviews have brought into question the effectiveness of post-fire

   millions of dollars continue to be spent annually on post-fire seeding

   development and implementation direction regarding post-fire
   rehabilitation treatments rests heavily on national- and regional-level
   natural resource managers. We conducted personal interviews and
   telephone surveys with the population of national- and regional-level
   natural resource managers (N = 6 and N = 17, respectively) involved
   directly in post-fire seeding activities on federally managed lands. We
   found that 71 \% of the respondents felt that information on the
   long-term effects of seeding was not sufficient. Respondents' perception
   about the effectiveness of seeding in curtailing spread of non-native
   species was mixed: 64 \% felt seeding was very or somewhat effective and
   36 \% felt it was not effective at all. Additional monitoring and
   research is needed that utilizes cost-benefit analyses for areas where
   values at risk are high. These analyses include whether or not to seed,
   seeding implementation methods, seed mix composition, and effectiveness
   of seeding in curtailing non-native species spread and reducing soil
   erosion. The majority of information available on seeding comes from
   short-term studies (<= 2 years). Testimonies and recent reviews
   demonstrate the need for review and refinement of current policy that
   includes stronger mandates and adequate funding for dedicated staff to
   conduct long-term monitoring spanning 5 years to 10 years. Land managers
   and scientists agree that there is a need for data on the long-term
   effectiveness of seeding treatments as well as further inquiry regarding
   effectiveness of seeding in mitigating non-native species invasions.
   Stronger communication and collaboration between these two groups would
   allow researchers to develop well-replicated monitoring designs for
   areas that land managers consider to be high priority for intensive
   quantitative long-term research of post-fire treatments.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the relationship between forest succession following fire and
   the composition of bird communities, we investigated the vegetation
   structure, bird population density, foraging behavior and guild
   structure in bamboo grasslands (11 years since the last fire), pine
   savanna (41 years), pine woodland (58 years), old-growth hemlock forest
   (never burned), and old-growth spruce forest (never burned) in the
   Tatachia area of central Taiwan. Canopy height, total foliage cover,
   tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags,
   foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with
   successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate
   successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more
   diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird
   species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in
   early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late
   successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and
   humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human
   activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional
   vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to
   the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time
   to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation.
   Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species
   found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage
   height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird
   species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a
   result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in
   late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in
   Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth
   forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In boreal ecosystems, wildfire severity (i.e., the extent of
   fire-related tree mortality) is affected by environmental conditions and
   fire intensity. A burned area usually includes tree patches that
   partially or entirely escaped fire. There are two types of post-fire
   residual patches: (1) patches that only escaped the last fire; and (2)
   patches with lower fire susceptibility, also called fire refuges, that
   escaped several consecutive fires, likely due to particular site
   characteristics. The main objective of this study was to test if
   particular environmental conditions and stand characteristics could
   explain the presence of fire refuges in the mixedwood boreal forest. The
   FlamMap3 fire behavior model running at the landscape scale was used on
   the present-day Lake Duparquet forest mosaic and on four other
   experimental scenarios. FlamMap3 was first calibrated using BehavePlus
   and realistic rates of fire spread obtained from the Canadian Fire
   Behavior Prediction system. The results, based on thousands of runs,
   exclude the effects of firebreaks, topography, fuel type, and
   microtopography to explain the presence of fire refuges, but rather
   highlight the important role of moisture conditions in the fuel beds.
   Moist conditions are likely attributed to former small depressions
   having been filled with organic matter rather than present-day
   variations in ground surface topography.}},

Abstract = {{In this study of a burned watershed in northwestern Wyoming, USA,
   sedimentation impacts following a moderately-sized fire (Boulder Creek
   burn, 2000) were evaluated against sediment loads estimated for the
   period prior to burning. Early observations of suspended sediment yield
   showed substantially elevated loads (5x) the first year post-fire
   (2001), followed by less elevated loads in 2002 and 2003, signalling a
   return to baseline values by 3 years post-fire. However, more recent
   work (8 years post-fire) has shown elevated suspended sediment yields
   that are more than double those predicted for the pre-burn range of
   flows. We tentatively attribute this increase to channel destabilization
   in the burned area due to the introduction of large wood from burned
   riparian zones and hillslopes. These results provide insight into the
   longer-term geomorphic impacts of wildfire that are associated with
   channel and bank instability in a burned riparian environment due, in
   part, to large wood dynamics.}},

   influence soil fertility: Implications for restoration of imperiled pine
   barrens habitat}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{470}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{In fire-dependent ecosystems, the absence of fire can contribute to a
   positive feedback in which increased vegetation cover leads to increased
   accumulation of soil organic matter and nutrient stocks. These changes
   in turn can influence competitive shifts among plant communities,
   resulting in increased woody plant establishment, canopy closure, and
   ultimately leading toward mesophication. Poor soil conditions may be
   especially important for maintaining the open structure characteristic
   of pine barrens ecosystems, which are imperiled due to loss of key
   ecosystem processes such as fire and land conversion to cropland or pine
   plantations. Our objectives were to determine how soil characteristics
   are related to recent prescribed fire management, and how soils vary
   along gradients of current and historic vegetation cover in a
   barrens-forest mosaic in northern Wisconsin, USA. We sought to
   understand whether management with prescribed fire shifts soils toward
   barrens-type soil conditions, and whether soil conditions typify barrens
   habitat relative to shrub and forest habitat We analyzed organic (i.e.
   forest floor) and mineral soil horizons collected along gradients of
   recent prescribed burn history and current (barrens, pine woodlands,
   brush, and closed-canopy forest) and historic vegetation cover types
   (barrens, pine plantations, deciduous forests) to investigate the
   influence of each on specific components of soil fertility. Using a
   model selection approach, we found forest floor soil properties were
   most frequently associated with differences in current vegetation cover;
   for instance, pine woodland sites had greater organic matter stocks than
   barrens sites, and cation stocks were generally greater at brush sites
   than barrens and pine woodland sites. Some soil properties, including
   pH, however, appeared to be driven by prescribed burn frequency. Using
   ordination techniques to characterize multidimensional characterizations
   of soils, we identified a soil legacy effect related to historic
   vegetation cover and land management; native barrens sites had soil
   characteristics intermediate to restored barrens of pine woodland and
   deciduous forest origin. Our findings suggest restoration of pine
   plantations to barrens could benefit from fire activities that enhance
   consumption of the forest floor, while restoration of deciduous forest
   and brush habitats will likely be more related to the effective control
   of hardwood regeneration, after which soil conditions may return to a
   more archetypical barrens state.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionUnder climate change and increased ignitions by humans, burning
   of forests in which severe fires were naturally infrequent may result in
   environmental changes that increase the probability that they will burn
   again. On the eastern slopes of the northern Patagonian Andes, after
   fire-resistant Nothofagus pumilio forests burn they are typically
   replaced by fire-prone shrublands dominated by resprouting shrubs. We
   examine fuel properties and microclimatic conditions at the community
   level as potential fire feedback mechanisms mediating switches from
   fire-resistant N.pumilio forests to fire-prone shrublands.
   LocationNorthwestern Chubut province, Patagonia, Argentina.
   MethodsWe characterized the volume and vertical distribution of fine
   fuels, understorey woody and semi-woody plant composition, stand
   structure and microclimatic conditions in unburned and burned N.pumilio
   forest and shrublands 14-29yr after severe fire.
   ResultsFuel amount and arrangement in unburned N.pumilio forests are
   unfavourable for fire activity compared with post-fire N.pumilio forests
   and shrublands. Unburned N.pumilio forests presented vertical
   discontinuities in fine fuel distribution and lesser amounts of fine
   fuels near the ground in comparison to fuels in shrublands. Floristic
   understorey composition of unburned and burned shrublands was very
   similar, while composition of unburned and burned N.pumilio forests
   showed clear differences. Additionally, microclimatic conditions
   following burning of N.pumilio forests and shrublands were significantly
   warmer and drier than in the unburned forest, and more frequently
   exceeded thresholds associated with fire activity in this region.
   ConclusionsPositive feedbacks from initial burning of otherwise
   fire-resistant N.pumilio forest will accelerate the rate of fire-induced
   conversion of forests to non-forest assemblages. Once transformed to the
   alternative state of shrublands, return to a forest cover is unlikely
   due to increased probability of burning in shrublands, as well as the
   unfavourable effects of warmer and drier conditions on tree
   establishment.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed to understand the effect of repeated fire on

   Ghats. Tropical dry deciduous forests are prone to forest fire owing to
   high fuel load and long dry season. Fire frequency map of the study area
   was prepared for 15 years from 1999 to 2013 using annual burn maps.
   Study area was stratified as B1 to B6 (one to six times burned) and
   compared to control (B0 - unburned during 1999-2013). Three plots were
   randomly laid in each stratum and seedlings; saplings and trees present
   in each plot were recorded. Species diversity indices showed increase in
   dominance and decrease in diversity with increasing fire frequency.
   Results showed that overall stem density (>1 cm DBH) ranged from 576 (SD
   112.69) (B1) to 236 (SD 20) individual ha(-1) (B6). The basal area
   ranged from 36.8 (SD 2.19) m(2) ha(-1) (B0) to 12.12 (SD 2.69) m(2)
   ha(-1) (B5). Fire promoted seedling density from B0 to B2 and after that
   it started decreasing whereas sapling density was poor in all classes
   and recorded least in B6. Stem density of trees did not vary much up to
   B3 and started decreasing after that. Number of species decreased
   linearly with increasing fire frequency. In the analysis of dominant
   species, Tectona grandis showed a very significant mean difference in
   seedling, sapling and tree population whereas Terminalia cranulata did
   not show significant difference in mean densities of seedling, sapling

Abstract = {{Fire can cause severe nitrogen (N) losses from grassland, chaparral, and
   temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Paradoxically, soil ammonium
   levels are markedly increased by fire, resulting in high rates of
   primary production in re-establishing plant communities. In a
   manipulative experiment, we examined the influence of wild-fire ash
   residues on soil, microbial and plant N pools in a recently burned
   Californian bishop pine (Pinus muricata D. Don) forest. Ash stimulated
   post-fire primary production and ecosystem N retention through direct N
   inputs from ash to soils, as well as indirect ash effects on soil N
   availability to plants. These results suggest that redistribution of
   surface ash after fire by wind or water may cause substantial
   heterogeneity in soil N availability to plants? and could be an
   important mechanism contributing to vegetation patchiness in fire-prone
   ecosystems. In addition, we investigated the impact of fire on ecosystem
   N cycling by comparing N-15 natural abundance values from recently
   burned and nearby unburned P. muricata forest communities. At the burned
   site, N-15 natural abundance in recolonising species was similar to that
   in bulk soil organic matter. By contrast, there was a marked N-15
   depletion in the same species relative to the total soil N pool at the
   unburned site. These results suggest that plant uptake of nitrate (which
   tends to be strongly depleted in N-15 because of fractionation during
   nitrification) is low in recently burned forest communities but could be
   an important component of ecosystem N cycling in mature conifer stands.}},

Abstract = {{In the western United States, overgrazing, weed invasion and wildfire
   have resulted in the conversion of shrub-steppe to annual grasslands,
   with substantial effects on ecosystem function. In these landscapes,
   badgers disturb large areas of soil while foraging for fossorial
   animals. Mounds created by badgers contained the lowest concentrations
   of total carbon, nitrogen and sulphur, mineral nitrogen and
   mineralizable nitrogen, inter-mound soils had the highest
   concentrations, and excavation pits had intermediate levels. Soil C:N
   ratio and pH were greater, and electrical conductivity and soluble Ca2+,
   Mg2+ and K+ were lower on mound soils compared with either pit or
   inter-mound soils. Larger pits generally trapped more litter, and
   increased litter mass equated with greater concentrations of active
   carbon, but only at the burned sites. Older mounds supported more
   vascular plants and cryptogamic crusts. Our results demonstrate reduced
   levels of nutrients and a higher C:N ratio on the mounds compared with
   either the pits or inter-mounds. Alteration to the homogeneous post-fire
   landscape by badgers contributes to patchiness in soils and vegetation,
   which is critical to the functioning of arid systems. Given their effect
   on soil C:N ratios, mounds may be important sites for recovery of
   indigenous shrub-steppe plant species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Colonization of mycorrhizal fungi was studied in a Pinus muricata forest
   on the coast in California, USA, burned by a stand-replacing wildfire in
   October 1995. Naturally established field seedlings of P. muricata were
   harvested 1 yr after the fire. The species composition of the
   mycorrhizal fungi on these field seedlings was dominated by Rhizopogon
   species, Wilcoxina mikolae and Tomentella sublilacina. Bioassays, set up
   with soil collected immediately after the fire, were used to determine
   which mycorrhizal species had colonized the burned area from resistant
   propagules. The P. muricata seedlings in these bioassays were dominated
   by suilloid and ascomycetous fungi, the same fungi which dominated the
   mycorrhizal flora of seedlings in pre-fire bioassays derived from the
   same forest site, suggesting that resistant propagules were the primary
   inoculum source for naturally establishing seedlings. Drying of
   post-fire soil for 1 month raised the number of bioassay seedlings
   associated with Rhizopogon olivaceotinctus, while the number of bioassay
   seedlings associated with Rhizopogon ochraceorubens was reduced. Fire
   appeared to have either stimulated or provided a competitive advantage
   to R. olivaceotinctus, which increased in abundance on the post-fire
   bioassay and field seedlings. Soil collected from the burned area was
   diluted with sterile soil in three different concentrations, and the
   number and frequency of mycorrhizal taxa on bioassay seedlings decreased
   with increased dilution. Although precise quantification was not
   possible, propagules of the Rhizopogon species were much more abundant
   than those of Tomentella or Wilcoxina species. Differences between the
   mycorrhizal associates of bioassay seedlings, naturally regenerated

Abstract = {{The northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis Trovessart) is a
   cavity- roosting species that forages in cluttered upland and riparian
   forests throughout the oak-dominated Appalachian and Central Hardwoods
   regions. Common prior to white-nose syndrome, the population of this bat
   species has declined to functional extirpation in some regions in the
   Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, including portions of the central
   Appalachians. Our long-term research in the central Appalachians has
   shown that maternity colonies of this species form non-random assorting
   networks in patches of suitable trees that result from longand
   short-term forest disturbance processes, and that roost loss can occur
   with these disturbances. Following two consecutive prescribed burns on
   the Fernow Experimental Forest in the central Appalachians, West
   Virginia, USA, in 2007 to 2008, post-fire counts of suitable black
   locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.; the most selected species for roosting)
   slightly decreased by 2012. Conversely, post-fire numbers of suitable
   maple (Acer spp. L.), primarily red maple (Acer rubrum L.), increased by
   a factor of three, thereby ameliorating black locust reduction.
   Maternity colony network metrics such as roost degree (use) and network
   density for two networks in the burned compartment were similar to the
   single network observed in unburned forest. However, roost clustering
   and degree of roost centralization was greater for the networks in the
   burned forest area. Accordingly, the short-term effects of prescribed
   fire are slightly or moderately positive in impact to day-roost habitat
   for the northern long-eared bat in the central Appalachians from a
   social dynamic perspective. Listing of northern long-eared bats as
   federally threatened will bring increased scrutiny of immediate fire
   impacts from direct take as well as indirect impacts from long-term
   changes to roosting and foraging habitat in stands being returned to
   historic fire-return conditions. Unfortunately, definitive impacts will
   remain speculative owing to the species' current rarity and the paucity
   of forest stand data that considers tree condition or that adequately
   tracks snags spatially and temporally.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the Great Basin, U.S. is currently dominated by sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentate ssp. (Rydb.) Boivin) ecosystems. At intermediate
   elevations, sagebrush ecosystems are increasingly influenced by pinyon
   (Pinus monophylla Torr. \& Frem.) and juniper (Juniperus osteospertna
   Torr.) expansion. Some scientists and policy makers believe that
   increasing woodland cover in the intermountain western US will create
   new carbon storage on the landscape; however, little is currently known
   about the distribution of carbon on these landscapes. This is especially
   true of below ground pools. Our objectives were to quantify the spatial
   distribution of soil carbon in expansion woodlands, and to determine
   prescribed fire's effect on soil C and N. We looked at two treatments
   (control and burn), three microsites (undertree, undershrub, and
   interspace), and four soil depths (0-8. 8-23, 23-38, and 38-52 cm). The
   study was conducted over a six year period with one year pre-fire and
   five years post-fire data. Results for both carbon and nitrogen were
   similar, indicating the close relationship between the two elements in
   this ecosystem. Undershrub microsites had higher soil C and N
   concentrations than interspace and undertree microsites: however, under
   tree microsites had higher C:N rat interspace and undershrub microsites.
   Carbon and nitrogen concentration tended to decrease with increasing
   depth at both control and burn sites. Prescribed burning caused
   immediate increases in surface soil C and N concentration, but over
   intermediate to longer periods of time no statistically detectable
   change in soil C or N content occurred from burning. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Boreal forests are an important carbon (C) sink and fire is the main
   natural disturbance, directly affecting the C-cycle via emissions from
   combustion of biomass and organic matter and indirectly through
   long-term changes in C-dynamics including soil respiration. Carbon
   dioxide (CO2) emission from soil (soil respiration) is one of the
   largest fluxes in the global C-cycle. Recovery of vegetation, organic
   matter and soil respiration may be influenced by the intensity of
   post-fire management such as salvage logging. To study the impact of
   forest fire, fire and salvage, and recovery time on soil respiration and
   soil C and N content, we sampled two permanent research areas in
   north-western Estonia that were damaged by fire: Vihterpalu (59 degrees
   13' N 23 degrees 49' E) in 1992 and Nova (59 degrees 10' N 23 degrees
   45' E) in 2008. Three types of sample plots were established: 1)
   unburned control with no harvesting (CO); 2) burned and uncleared (BU);
   and 3) burned and cleared (BC). Measurements were made in 2013, 21 years
   after wildfire in Vihterpalu and 5 years after wildfire in NOva. Soil
   respiration ranged from 0.00 to 1.38 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1). Soil respiration
   in the burned and cleared areas (BC) was not reduced compared to burned
   and uncleared (BU) areas but the average soil respiration in unburned
   control areas was more than twice the value in burned areas (average
   soil respiration in CO areas was 0.34 CO2 m(-2) h(-1), versus 0.16 CO2
   m(-2) h(-1), the average soil respiration of BC and BU combined).
   Recovery over 20 years was mixed; respiration was insignificantly lower
   on younger than older burned sites (when BC and BU values were combined,
   the average values were 0.15 vs. 0.17 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively);
   soil-C was greater in the older burned plots than the younger (when BC
   and BU values were combined, the average values were 9.71 vs. 5.99 kg
   m(-2), respectively); but root biomass in older and recently burned
   areas was essentially the same (average 2.23 and 2.11 kg m(-2),
   respectively); soil-N was highest on burned areas 20 years after fire.
   Twenty years post-fire may be insufficient time for carbon dynamics to
   fully recover on these low productivity sandy sites.}},

Abstract = {{Fire in shrub-dominated portions of the Great Basin. largely fueled by
   non-native annuals such as Bromus tectorum, has become an important
   structuring force altering vegetation composition and soil
   characteristics. The extent to which fire affects native species in
   drier portions of the Great Basin, termed salt desert, is poorly
   documented. We conducted a survey of grazed salt desert habitat in
   northwestern Nevada 5 years after wildfires burned 650,000 ha, with the
   goal of investigating community response to fire and factors correlating
   with post-fire recovery. We found that recruitment of a dominant shrub,
   Artemisia spinescens, is severely restricted following fire: it occurred
   in only 2 of the 24 burned sites. The co-dominant shrub, Atriplex
   confertifolia, occurred in most burned sites although on average its
   percent cover was one-third lower than adjacent unburned sites. Biotic
   soil crust cover was four times lower, and non-native species cover 5
   times higher, in burned sites compared to unburned. Ordination analyses
   confirmed differences among plant communities in burned versus unburned
   sites, with environmental variables soil conductivity, plant litter,
   soil potassium (K+) and pH explaining 38\% of the variance in community
   composition. However, we found no environmental predictors of recovery
   for native species in burned sites. Future recruitment is likely to be
   further limited, as fire frequency in the salt desert is expected to
   increase with invasion by non-native annual grasses and with global
   climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Determinants of the balance between grass and woody vegetation in
   grasslands and savannas have received considerable attention because of
   the potential for dramatic shifts in ecosystem structure and function as
   one growth form replaces the other. We studied a mesic grassland where
   recently established ``shrub islands{''} are increasing in abundance due
   to fire suppression. Our objective was to assess the role of the direct
   effects of fire vs. indirect alterations in resource availability (N and
   light), as mechanisms that may constrain/facilitate shrub (Cornus
   drummondii) encroachment.
   The direct effects of fire in 2001 and 2002 were 100\% aboveground
   mortality of C. drummondii shoots and removal of the detrital layer.
   Post-fire resprouting resulted in similar to600\% increase in stem
   density compared to a 200\% increase in shrub islands protected from
   fire. In burned shrub islands with an added detrital layer, temperature
   and light penetration to the soil surface were reduced (by 6.5degreesC
   and to <3\% of full sunlight), but stem density still increased by
   similar to400\%. Thus, both the direct effects of fire and the indirect
   effect on the energy environment increased C. drummondii stem densities.
   In contrast, N additions did not influence new stem production or
   aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP; grams per square meter per
   year), suggesting that N availability did not constrain shrub growth
   during this study. While fire did not impact total ANPP, it did shift
   the relative, abundance of growth forms. Grass productivity (360.7 +/-
   20.1 g/m(2) {[}mean +/- 1 SE]) was stimulated (an increase of similar
   to30\%) by the high light conditions of the post-fire environment, while
   C. drummondii ANPP (34.2 +/- 2.4 g/m(2)) was reduced by similar to30\%.
   In shrub islands protected from fire, C. drummondii ANPP was greatest
   (50.4 +/- 2.2 g/m(2)), whereas lower graminoid ANPP (282.5 +/- 19.9
   g/m(2)) was observed. The persistence of woody vegetation, despite two
   successive fires, along with a significant reduction in grass ANPP
   (similar to30\%) suggests that once established, C. drummondii can
   persist and exclude C, grasses. Thus, restoring fire to mesic grasslands
   may prevent further conversion to shrub/woodland, but the abundance of
   shrubs is likely to remain unchanged with community structure
   co-dominated by multiple growth forms.}},

Volume = {{404}},

Abstract = {{Cork oak ecosystems, which are biodiversity hotspots and have great
   socio-economic importance in the western Mediterranean Basin, have been
   experiencing serious decline in the last decades attributed to different
   causes, including wildfires. Besides direct mortality, the surviving
   burned trees become more vulnerable following fire and may be attacked
   by wood boring insects (Coleoptera), which may further affect tree vigor
   and give rise to massive dispersing offspring affecting surrounding
   areas. In the first spring after a wildfire that occurred in July 2013
   in a cork oak stand in central Portugal, we set up different types of
   insect traps (interception, emergence and aggregation pheromone traps),
   and monitored them for up to 16 months. Fire occurrence had a great
   impact on cork oak trees attractiveness to xylophagous insects, which
   increased significantly with increasing fire severity. Living unburned
   trees located close to the fire edge were clearly avoided, while burned
   trees with no regeneration were the most attractive. Four species of
   ambrosia beetles, represented nearly 90\% of all xylophagous insects
   captured in interception and emergence traps, namely Platypus cylindrus
   (Platypodinae), Xyleborus monographus, Xyleborinus saxeseni and
   Xyleborus thyographus (Scolytinae). Therefore, the presence of ambrosia
   beetles in recently burned forests should be carefully assessed, and
   their control should focus on preventing colonization and the spread of
   infestation. Forest management should primarily focus on increasing tree
   vigor, and on reducing the factors that may increase burn severity if a
   fire occurs. In the first years after a wildfire, it is advisable to
   avoid any activities that are likely to increase stress of burned and
   neighbouring unburned trees, such as cork extraction, branch pruning and
   soil ploughing. Additionally, post-fire logging and removal of dead
   trees before the next spring (when first emergences start to occur), and
   the use of pheromone traps, are other possible measures to reduce the
   number of beetles in these situations.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-42}},

Abstract = {{Soil respiration includes soil microbial respiration, soil fauna
   respiration, and plant root respiration, and therefore it reflects the
   biological activity of the soil ecosystems. The Siberian Taiga often
   experiences serious damage from forest fire, due to the very low
   precipitation in spring. We measured the soil respiration in five forest
   soil ecosystems with different histories of forest fire in Yakutsk in
   August 1997. The dominant tree species was Larix cajanderi, and the
   soils were Spodosols with a sandy and loamy texture. We also measured
   the soil respiration in a grassland. At severely burned sites, almost
   all the trees had fallen, litter and vegetation on the forest floor had
   burned, and other forms of vegetation, including bryophytes or herbs,
   had invaded. At less severely burned forest sites, the trees were still
   standing but litter and vegetation on the forest door had disappeared.
   Soil temperature, moisture, pH, and EC all increased after severe forest
   fires, and the A-horizon showed a higher organic carbon content and a
   lower CN ratio. Soil respiration rate ranged from 18 to 397 (10(-6) g
   CO(2) m(-2) s(-1)) in the same order reported so far. Soil respiration
   in severely burned forests was significantly lower than in intact
   forests, and was similar to that of grassland. Furthermore, mildly
   burned forests showed soil respiration values intermediate between those
   of severely burned and intact forests. These findings suggest that tree
   root respiration is considerably higher than root respiration of other
   plants or microbial and fauna respiration in soil. Soil microbial
   respiration was determined by the incubation method under the same
   temperature and soil moisture conditions as those in situ. Multiple
   regression analysis for mineral soils showed that the soil microbial
   respiration increased with the increase of the soil temperature and
   organic carbon content, and that the soil microbial respiration
   decreased with the increase of pH. Whole soil microbial respiration
   within 1 m depth was higher in severely burned forests than in intact
   forests, These findings show that forest fire increased the soil,
   microbial respiration and confirm that the loss of tree root respiration
   was the main reason for the decrease in soil respiration after severe
   forest fire. The contribution of tree root respiration to soil

Title = {{Reconciling wildlife conservation to forest restoration in moist
   mixed-conifer forests of the inland northwest: A synthesis}},

Abstract = {{Moist, mixed conifer (MMC) forests, which encompass more than 11 million
   ha in the Inland Northwest, USA and adjacent Canada, were extensively
   modified after Euro-american occupation by now-outdated forestry
   practices and wildfire suppression. Those activities homogenized tree
   composition and density, modified forest soils, increased risks to
   insect and disease epidemics, and, in combination with longer drought
   periods ultimately increased the prevalence of unusually severe
   wildfires to further homogenize landscapes. Recommendations for
   restoring structure and function include re-establishing natural fire
   regimes and disturbance-patch size distributions across landscapes, as
   well as restoring and maintaining large, old early-seral dominant trees
   (LOEST), large snags and coarse woody debris, while accounting for
   physiographic influences. Implementing such recommendations with
   sensitivity to wildlife conservation requires additional details to
   account for habitat needs at the planning levels of national forests and
   districts. We synthesized silviculture-specific literature for wildlife
   species of greatest conservation concern listed in the strategic
   wildlife conservation plans of Inland Northwest states ({''}strategy{''}
   species), others of social and economic importance ({''}focal{''}
   species), and some others that are either important in the ecologies of
   strategy species or otherwise offer literature having particular
   relevance to MMC silviculture ({''}facilitative{''} species).
   Evaluations of habitat selection behavior and comparisons of species
   specific habitat values to tree-stocking guidelines used by
   silviculturists indicated that most species reviewed are likely to
   respond positively to restoration, and that a wide array of extant
   silvicultural methods can be used, provided that large snags and
   acceptable levels of coarse woody debris are recruited or retained.
   Thinning followed by routine prescribed burning will be problematic for
   some wildlife species. Knowledge of wildlife responses to variation in
   the size distribution of disturbance patches is limited, as is knowledge
   of wildlife population responses to intentional forestry. Coupling new
   wildlife research to forest modeling and manipulative experiments within
   adaptive management and monitoring frameworks will improve predictions
   of wildlife population responses over the long time frames and multiple
   spatial scales associated with strategic planning.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a key ecological force in pine forests worldwide, and faunal
   responses to this disturbance have been a major topic of ecology, yet
   little is known for oceanic island environments. Using line transects we
   surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned
   in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was
   to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that
   influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging
   guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of
   regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed
   results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire
   severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and
   total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and
   moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either
   Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an
   overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of
   Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common
   blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff
   (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees
   was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus
   teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but
   also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major
   canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the
   ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea) were
   influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We
   recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future
   post-fire management plans. Priority post-fire actions should be
   directed toward the protection and conservation of the endemic blue
   chaffinch, a species of conservation concern on the nearby island of
   Gran Canaria.}},

Abstract = {{Fire refugia - the unburned areas within fire perimeters - are important
   to the survival of many taxa through fire events and the revegetation of
   post-fire landscapes. Previous work has shown that species use and
   benefit from small-scale fire refugia (1-1000 m(2)), but our
   understanding of where and how fire refugia form is largely limited to
   the scale of remotely sensed data (i.e., 900 m(2) Landsat pixels). To
   examine the causes and consequences of small fire refugia, we
   field-mapped all unburned patches >= 1 m(2 )within a contiguous 25.6ha
   forest plot that burned at generally low-to-moderate severity in the
   2013 Yosemite Rim Fire, California, USA. Within the Yosemite Forest
   Dynamics Plot (YFDP), there were 685 unburned patches >= 1 m(2),
   covering a total unburned area of 12,597 m(2) (4.9\%). Small refugia
   occurred in all fire severity classifications. Random forest models
   showed that the proportion of unburned area of 100 m(2) grid cells
   corresponded to pre-fire density and basal area of trees, distance to
   the nearest stream, and immediate fire mortality, but the relationships
   were complex and model accuracy was variable. From a pre-fire population
   of 34,061 total trees >= 1 cm diameter at breast height (1.37 m; DBH)
   within the plot (1330 trees ha(-1)), trees of all five of the most
   common species and those DBH < 30 cm had higher immediate survival rates
   if their boles were wholly or partially within an unburned patch (P <=
   0.001). Trees 1 cm <= DBH < 10 cm that survived were located closer to
   the center of the unburned patch than the edge (mean 1.1m versus 0.6 m;
   ANOVA; P <= 0.001). Four-year survival rates for trees 1 cm <= DBH < 10
   cm were 58.8\% within small refugia and 2.7\% in burned areas (P <=
   0.001). Species richness and the Shannon Diversity Index were associated
   with unburned quadrats in NMDS ordinations 3 years post-fire. Bum
   heterogeneity in mixed-conifer forests likely exists at all scales and
   small refugia contribute to diversity of forest species and structures.
   Thus, managers may wish to consider scales from 1-m(2) to the landscape
   when designing fuel reduction prescriptions. The partial predictability
   of refugia location suggests that further work may lead to predictive
   models of refugial presence that have considerable potential to preserve
   ecological function or human habitation in fire-frequent forests.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Early-seral ecosystems make important contributions to regional
   biodiversity by supporting high abundance and diversity of many plant
   and animal species that are otherwise rare or absent from closed-canopy
   forests. Therefore, the period of post-fire tree establishment is a key
   stage in forest stand and ecosystem development that can be viewed in
   the context of competing management interests in diverse early-seral
   ecosystems vs. rapid forest development for ecological or commercial
   objectives. Previous work in Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests of the
   Pacific Northwest suggests stands initiate either with abrupt
   establishment (<20 years) or by protracted establishment with low tree
   density persisting >00 years. To improve understanding of how post-fire
   tree establishment and early cohort development have varied in space and
   over time and elucidate some of the factors contributing to that
   variation, we analyzed forest structure, tree ages, and Douglas-fir
   growth across the central western Cascades of Oregon where cohort ages
   span nearly eight centuries. The number of post-fire cohorts was
   estimated per stand, and establishment trajectories were evaluated by
   cohort. On average, it took 43.5 years to reach establishment of 90\% of
   the trees per cohort. The rate and duration of establishment were
   surprisingly consistent across variation in topography (elevation, slope
   position, and aspect), among cohorts initiated from the late 12th to the
   early 20th century, and regardless of the severity of the
   cohort-initiating fire or the timing of establishment by shade-tolerant
   species. Only 8\% of cohorts completed establishment within 20 years and
   12\% had establishment lasting >80 years. Douglas-fir growth (basal area
   increment) exhibits high plasticity in relation to different competitive
   interactions within uni-specific and multi-species cohorts and between
   cohorts of different age, suggesting wide variation in the structure and
   dynamics of early-seral ecosystems and an ability to tolerate moderate
   competition when young. This study illustrates that post-fire
   establishment in Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests of the central
   western Cascades historically was a multi-decadal process. Limited
   regeneration in a short window did not necessarily lead to persistent
   shrublands. In fact, post-fire forest development appears resilient to
   considerable variation in the fire regime and climatic and biotic
   constraints on tree establishment.}},

   primarily based on the 15 SAR scenes acquired during arctic growing

   progression of the fire, and interferometric coherence images are used
   to qualify burn severity and monitor post-fire recovery. We base our
   analysis of the fire on three test sites, two from within the fire and
   one unburned site. The B346 fire increased backscattered intensity
   values for the two burn study sites by approximately 5-6 dB and
   substantially reduced coherence from background levels of approximately
   0.8 in unburned background forested areas to approximately 0.2 in the

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{268}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Fire has been a natural force modulating the vegetation of the Brazilian
   Cerrado since long before the first humans arrived in this region about
   12 thousand years BP. Cerrado plants are, therefore, adapted to fire and
   some of them depend on fire to maintain their reproduction and survival.
   However, after the use of fire as a tool to destroy vast extents of
   forests in the last centuries, Brazilians in general formed a very
   negative opinion about the use of fire and burning native vegetation was
   prohibited in the country. Although this decision was effective in
   protecting tropical forests, the zero-fire policy has been quite
   negative in the Cerrado. Fire suppression in Cerrado reserves has caused
   a dramatic loss of biodiversity at landscape level (homogenizing the
   vegetation structure), at species level (leading non-tree species to
   local extinction) and likely at population level (sexual reproduction
   impaired). Furthermore, fuel accumulation over several years without
   fire increases the risks of catastrophic firestorms that will inevitably
   occur. Such negative consequences of fire suppression in the Cerrado
   have not been noticed even among ecologists, including myself in early
   career and until recently. The biased tree-and-carbon perspective of
   environmental campaigns and ecological studies have reinforced the
   misunderstanding of fire effects in Cerrado vegetation. Both neglect
   that the absolute majority of Cerrado plant species, as well as
   associated fauna and ecosystem services, depend upon open
   vegetation-structures which are mostly maintained by fire.}},

Abstract = {{After an experimental fire in steep shrubland in a temperate-humid
   region (north-west Spain), the effects of two post-fire stabilisation
   treatments (grass seeding and straw mulching) on the chemical properties
   of eroded sediments, and the amount of nutrients lost with them, were
   evaluated relative to control burnt soil, over a period of 13 months.
   Total C and N concentrations, and delta C-13, indicated that sediments
   were mainly contributed by charred plant and litter material. The
   highest concentrations of extractable base cations in the sediments
   occurred during the first 3 months following fire, especially for Na and
   K. As treatments had little or no effect on nutrient concentration in
   sediments, differences in nutrient losses were due to the 10-fold lower
   sediment production in mulching compared with other treatments. In
   control and seeding treatments, the accumulated amounts of nutrients
   lost with sediments were 989-1028 kg ha(-1) (C), 77 kg ha(-1) (N),

Abstract = {{Fire is a dominant process in boreal forest landscapes and creates a
   spatial patch mosaic with different burn severities and age classes.
   Quantifying effects of vegetation and topography on burn severity
   provides a scientific basis on which forest fire management plans are
   developed to reduce catastrophic fires. However, the relative
   contribution of vegetation and topography to burn severity is highly
   debated especially under extreme weather conditions. In this study, we
   hypothesized that relationships of vegetation and topography to burn
   severity vary with fire size. We examined this hypothesis in a boreal
   forest landscape of northeastern China by computing the burn severity of
   24 fire patches as the difference between the pre- and post-fire
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index obtained from two Landsat TM
   images. The vegetation and topography to burn severity relationships
   were evaluated at three fire-size levels of small (< 100 ha, n = 12),
   moderate (100-1,000 ha, n = 9), and large (> 1,000 ha, n = 3). Our
   results showed that vegetation and topography to burn severity
   relationships were fire-size-dependent. The burn severity of small fires
   was primary controlled by vegetation conditions (e.g., understory
   cover), and the burn severity of large fires was strongly influenced by
   topographic conditions (e.g., elevation). For moderate fires, the
   relationships were complex and indistinguishable. Our results also
   indicated that the pattern trends of relative importance for both
   vegetation and topography factors were not dependent on fire size. Our
   study can help managers to design fire management plans according to
   vegetation characteristics that are found important in controlling burn
   severity and prioritize management locations based on the relative
   importance of vegetation and topography.}},

Abstract = {{Taxonomic impediments require us to know if simpler approaches such as
   using higher taxa or habitat surrogates can help assess the needs of
   invertebrates when managing forests. This study tests whether higher
   taxon (families for species) and habitat (vegetation structure for
   species and families) surrogates might assist in determining the effects
   of prescribed burning on spiders. Spiders were sampled at sites
   representing a chronosequence of increasing ages since burning (0, 3, 6
   and 9 years) by pitfall trapping and vacuuming from understorey
   vegetation in the Southwest Botanical Province of Australia; a global
   biodiversity hotspot. Reassembly followed a similar pattern for both the
   richness of species and families. Immediately following burning, mean
   richness of families and species was low (8.75 and 14.5, respectively).
   By 3 years, however, there were significant increases in familial and
   species richness (13.25 and 23.75, respectively). Thereafter, taxon
   richness remained constant. Multiple regressions suggested habitat
   variables potentially influencing family and species richness were
   litter depth, bare ground (\%), the density of dead vegetation (0-100 cm
   high), and the density of live vegetation (40-140 cm). The first three
   of these variables correlated significantly with time since burning,
   suggesting these components of habitat structure are useful predictors
   of taxon richness for spiders following fire. For assemblage
   composition, the congruence in post-fire response patterns between
   taxonomic ranks was highly significant, although the amount of variation
   explained was low (Rho < 0.55). In the first 9 years post-fire, there
   was a significant shift in the taxonomic composition of spiders at
   family, but not specific, rank. Family composition at recently burnt
   sites differed significantly from that at sites burnt 9 years
   previously. Correlated with assemblage composition were litter depth,
   bare ground, and the density of live vegetation (0-40 cm above the
   ground). However, the best correlation obtained by any combination of
   habitat variables with assemblage composition (Rho < 0.317) was less
   than that obtained by using family level data. We conclude, therefore,
   that where resources are limited and there is a need to determine the
   effects of forest management practices on invertebrates using
   surrogates, identifying spiders to higher taxa is better than relying on
   habitat structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, objectives for forests with moderate- or mixed-severity
   fire regimes are to restore successionally diverse landscapes that are
   resistant and resilient to current and future stressors. Maintaining
   native species and characteristic processes requires this successional
   diversity, but methods to achieve it are poorly explained in the
   literature. In the Inland Pacific US, large, old, early seral trees were
   a key historical feature of many young and old forest successional
   patches, especially where fires frequently occurred. Large, old trees
   are naturally fire-tolerant, but today are often threatened by dense
   understory cohorts that create fuel ladders that alter likely post-fire
   successional pathways. Reducing these understories can contribute to
   resistance by creating conditions where canopy trees will survive
   disturbances and climatic stressors; these survivors are important seed
   sources, soil protectors, and critical habitat elements. Historical
   timber harvesting has skewed tree size and age class distributions,
   created hard edges, and altered native patch sizes. Manipulating these
   altered forests to promote development of larger patches of older,
   larger, and more widely-spaced trees with diverse understories will
   increase landscape resistance to severe fires, and enhance wildlife
   habitat for underrepresented conditions.
   Closed-canopy, multi-layered patches that develop in hot, dry summer
   environments are vulnerable to droughts, and they increase landscape
   vulnerability to insect outbreaks and severe wildfires. These same
   patches provide habitat for species such as the northern spotted owl,
   which has benefited from increased habitat area. Regional and local
   planning will be critical for gauging risks, evaluating trade-offs, and
   restoring dynamics that can support these and other species. The goal
   will be to manage for heterogeneous landscapes that include
   variably-sized patches of (1) young, middle-aged, and old, closed canopy
   forests growing in upper montane, northerly aspect, and valley bottom
   settings, (2) a similar diversity of open-canopy, fire-tolerant patches
   growing on ridgetops, southerly aspects, and lower montane settings, and
   (3) significant montane chaparral and grassland areas. Tools to achieve
   this goal include managed wildfire, prescribed burning, and variable
   density thinning at small to large scales. Specifics on ``how much and
   where?{''} will vary according to physiographic, topographic and
   historical templates, and regulatory requirements, and be determined by
   means of a socio-ecological process. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping fire severity is determinant to understand landscape evolution
   after a wildfire and provides useful information for decision making
   during post fire management. Quantitative fire severity mapping from
   relative changes in Normalized Burn Ratio index (RdNBR) is not actually
   being incorporated into decision making processes, being more useful the
   categorization in severity levels (high, moderate and low). However, the
   most common mapping severity methodologies based on the definition of
   RdNBR thresholds from field information are not always possible due to
   lack of field data or because the published thresholds are
   unsatisfactory in new regions. The boom in the use of UAVs (Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicle) has raised these platforms as potential tools for
   validation of remote sensing data. This paper presents the potential of
   UAVs as ground truth information in forest fires. From the
   photointerpretation of high resolution RGB images, the Aerial Severity
   Proportion Index (ASPI) has been created. Non-linear regression models
   between RdNBR and ASPI allows to delimitate of thresholds for the
   classification of Landsat images and to obtain qualitative severity
   maps. Validation with random points presents a kappa index of 0,5 and a
   relative accuracy of 70,8\%. Therefore, UAV images become a very useful
   tool for wildfire severity mapping and for fill the gap between remote
   sensing information and expensive field ground campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale disturbances, notably fire and grazing, structure grass and

   establishment of a `phantom' community comprised of fugitive species.
   Although transient. these species increase diversity and recharge the
   seed bank before the next disturbance; (2) regeneration of the original
   community by persistence of resprouter species and by auto-replacement;,
   (3) early stages of invasion by seedlings of the shrub Fabiana

   patches. Weed invasion vas principally due to the ruderal exotic species
   Verbascum thapsus from the nearby road verge and by rapid increase of
   Rumex acetosella cover. another exotic species present before the fire.
   Although post-fire climatic conditions are particularly important in
   semi-arid environments, Succession depends greatly on the regeneration
   strategies and dispersal abilities of the species present in the burned
   area. The phantom community occurs only at the first stage of succession
   when there is little competition for resources. We could call this

   competition for resources becomes progressively more important, could be
   called `the effort to maintain space'.}},

Abstract = {{Young mixed hardwood forest communities that colonized abandoned
   croplands during the late 19th century in northern Florida were
   typically winter burned annually after pine saplings could survive fire.
   Hardwood trees persisted as coppice that grew from root crowns within
   grassy undergrowth. This plant community changed little thereafter,
   except for the continued growth of pine trees. An 8.64-ha tract of this
   community was inventoried in 1966, from which fire was permanently
   excluded thereafter. This tract, called NB66, was reinventoried in 2010
   to document maturation of the plant community and to identify the
   contributing causes that controlled ecological development. Hardwood
   coppice that was released from fire grew to form a nearly continuous
   canopy averaging 19.7 m high after 44 years. Many older pines died and
   disintegrated without causing canopy gaps. Prior to 19th century
   plantation agriculture, the original vegetation consisted of shortleaf
   pine-oak-hickory (SPOH) woodland, which intergraded with longleaf pine
   savanna on sandier soils. These species occur at NB66 but the forest
   remains dominated by native offsite species, which are aggressively
   reproducing. These offsite species formerly occurred in less elevated
   landscape positions in association with magnolia-beech and bottomland
   hardwood forests. Frequently burned old-field pineland adjacent to NB66
   has remained stable indicating that no factors other than fire exclusion
   caused release of hardwoods from their ``fire trap.{''} There was no
   trend toward recovery of the original SPOH community, and forest
   development is postulated on the basis of mesophication processes.
   Recruitment of new species-both woody and herbaceous-since 1966 was
   modest; most remain uncommon.}},

   Adjacent burned areas of Bandelier National Monument were not seeded,

   plots, foliar cover of ryegrass declined from 1997 to 1998 due to
   self-inhibition and/or reduced precipitation from 1997 to 1998. Foliar
   cover and diversity of native forbs were greater in 1997 than 1998,
   probably due to a wet growing season in 1997. Cover, species richness,
   and diversity of native forbs were highest in non-seeded areas of
   moderate- and high-burn intensities. Regeneration and survivorship of
   conifer seedlings decreased as ryegrass cover increased, particularly in

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Water repellency (WR) and aggregate stability (AS) are two soil
   properties generally modified after burning which show several
   hydrological and soil functioning consequences and may be used as
   indices for assessing burn severity. Both properties are strongly
   related and have major impacts on soil functioning and post-fire
   hydrologic and geomorphological processes. In many cases, the impact of
   fire on these properties has been analyzed in the short term. However,
   it is also necessary to investigate the magnitude of these changes and
   their implications for longer periods under specific conditions. In this
   work, we have investigated {[}1] the fire-induced changes on soil WR and
   AS in the medium term (6-year period after burning) and its distribution
   within aggregate size fractions (1-2, 0.5-1 and 0.25-0.5 mm), {[}2] the
   relations between post-fire AS and WR, and {[}3] the interactions
   between AS. WR and different factors (site, time since burning,
   lithology and vegetation type) in Mediterranean calcareous soils. Five
   areas burned during the summer 2006 in southern Spain were selected for
   this study. The study sites were characterized by wettable or slightly
   water-repellent calcareous soils with loam to clayey texture under
   herbaceous vegetation and shrubs. Soils were characterized chemically
   and physically, while the WR and AS of the fine earth and aggregate
   sieve fractions were determined annually between 2006 and 2011. Results
   show that soil WR was induced in previously wettable or enhanced in
   slightly or moderately water-repellent calcareous soils after moderate
   severity burning. Severity of WR from finer aggregates (0.5-1 and
   0.25-0.5 mm) varied or remained stable but did not contribute to general
   soil WR assessed in the fine earth fraction. AS was slightly increased
   in some cases, and both properties returned progressively to pre-fire
   conditions during the study period. Soil resilience to low-moderate
   severity burning in the study area was very high. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning has become more common for the management of eastern
   forests in North America, so understanding if and how foraging bats
   respond to structural changes generated by fire is of increasing
   importance. Our objective was to investigate the effects of post-fire
   landscape conditions on the occurrence of foraging bats in mixed forests
   of the Cumberland Plateau physiographic region. We deployed Anabat II
   bat detectors in 164 paired burned and unburned forest sites for >= 2
   nights from mid-May through August 2014 and 2015 to monitor bat foraging
   and commuting habitat use. We conducted vegetation surveys to quantify
   site-specific structural characteristics, which indicated that measures
   of structure were significantly lower in burned sites than unburned
   sites. We used Program Presence to test a priori hypotheses of
   species-specific probability of detection and site occupancy related to
   weather, burn history (Le., site burned within the past 10 years or
   unburned), and site and landscape characteristics. Bats were detected at
   94\% of burned sites and 83\% of unburned sites. Probability of
   detection was affected by weather conditions, vegetative structure, and
   burn history for most species. Occupancy for all species/species groups
   examined was positively associated with burning and generally associated
   with lower vegetative structure. Although burn severity did not affect
   most species groups, occupancy of Myotis species and tri-colored bats
   (Perimyotis subflavus) was lower in sites that received moderate
   severity burns than in sites that received low severity burns.
   Therefore, while prescribed fire may provide vegetative structure
   conducive to efficient foraging for all bats of the Cumberland Plateau,
   our results demonstrate that retaining some unburned forests while
   creating mosaics of lower and higher severity burns across the landscape
   will result in favorable foraging conditions for all resident bat
   species.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires could have a strong impact on tundra environment by combusting
   surface vegetation and soil organic matter. For surface vegetation, many
   years are required to recover to pre-fire level. In this paper, by using
   C-band (VV/HV polarization) and L-band (HH polarization) synthetic
   aperture radar (SAR) images acquired before and after fire from 2002 to
   2016, we investigated vegetation change affected by the Anaktuvuk River
   Fire in Arctic tundra environment. Compared to the unburned areas, C-
   and L-band SAR backscatter coefficients increased by up to 5.5 and 4.4
   dB in the severely burned areas after the fire. Then past 5 years
   following the fire, the C-band SAR backscatter differences decreased to
   pre-fire level between the burned and unburned areas, suggesting that
   vegetation coverage in burned sites had recovered to the unburned level.
   This duration is longer than the 3-year recovery suggested by
   optical-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
   observations. While for the L-band SAR backscatter after 10-year
   recovery, about 2 dB higher was still found in the severely burned area,
   compared to the unburned area. The increased roughness of the surface is
   probably the reason for such sustained differences. Our analysis implies
   that long records of space-borne SAR backscatter can monitor post-fire
   vegetation recovery in Arctic tundra environment and complement optical
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsWe aimed to analyse the effect of fire on flowering in
   subtropical grasslands, by addressing the following questions: will fire
   history affect flowering? If yes, do fire feedbacks influence flowering
   or is it just the removal of above-ground biomass? Are there differences
   in burned and mowed plots?
   LocationSubtropical grasslands in Southern Brazil (30 degrees 03S, 51
   degrees 07W).
   MethodsWe established plots in areas with different fire histories: 30d
   (30 plots: five replicates), 1yr (14 replicates), 3yr (30 plots: five
   replicates) since the last fire, in experimentally burned and mowed
   plots (14 replicates each). We counted the number of flowering species,
   as well as the number of flowering stalks.
   ResultsGraminoid species flowered in highest numbers 1yr after fire,
   whilst forbs had more species flowering just after fire, indicating
   different reproductive strategies in post-fire environments. Mowing was
   not as efficient as fire in stimulating flowering. Finally, the
   different functional groups showed different flowering responses to time
   since last fire and to the different types of management.
   ConclusionsOur results show fire stimulated flowering. Although mowing
   can be a good alternative for maintaining plant diversity, our study
   showed that this practice is not as efficient as fire in stimulating
   flowering. However, fire season should be noted as a limiting factor to
   the recovery of C-3 grasses in these subtropical grasslands, and annual
   burns may be harmful to C-4 grasses, since they delay their flowering to
   the next post-fire growing season.}},

   the burned area in 1999; 25\% of the plots were resampled in 2001 to
   ensure that differences between sites were consistent and persistent,

   differed significantly between unburned and burned sites; eight species
   were identified as indicators of the unburned site and thirteen as
   indicators of the burned site. Plant cover was nearly twice as great in
   the burned site than in the unburned site in the first years of
   measurement and was 4.6 times greater in the burned site in 2001.
   Average and total species richness was greater in the burned site,
   explained mostly by higher numbers of native annual and biennial forbs.
   Overstory canopy cover and duff depth were significantly lower in the
   burned site, and there were significant inverse relationships between
   these variables and plant species richness and plant cover. Greater than
   95\% of the species in the post-fire community were native and exotic
   plant cover never exceeded 1\%, in contrast with other northern Arizona
   forests that were dominated by exotic species following high-severity
   fires. This difference is attributed to the minimal anthropogenic
   disturbance history (no logging, minimal grazing) of forests in the
   national park, and suggests that park managers may have more options
   than non-park managers to use intense fire as a tool for forest
   conservation and restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important driver of land cover change throughout the world,
   affecting processes such as deforestation, forest recovery and
   vegetation transition. Little attention has been given to the role of
   fire in shaping the temporal and spatial land cover changes among
   continents. This study has integrated two MODIS products (MCD64A1:
   Burned area and MCD12Q1: Land cover) over Africa and South America from
   2001-2013 to explore the vegetation dynamics after fires. The results
   indicated that while Africa suffered from repeated fires, more than 50\%
   of the total burned area in South America experienced only one fire. The
   vegetation dynamics of the high-density vegetated regions in the 10
   years after a fire showed that the forest losses in the first year after
   a fire in Africa were slightly larger than that in South America
   (Africa: 17.2\% vs. South America: 14.5\% in the Northern Hemisphere).
   The continental comparison suggested that early successional forests in
   Africa recovered relatively fast (northern part: 10.2 years; southern
   part: 12.8 years) than in South America, which recovered (18.4 years)
   slowly in Northern Hemisphere or ever with no recovery in the Southern
   Hemisphere. No clear information of the recoveries of other vegetation
   types (i.e., shrub, grass and crop) in Africa or South America could be
   identified from the satellite data. In addition, we also analyzed the
   changes of high-density vegetation in non-burned regions in both
   continents. These findings highlighted the impact of the fire regime on
   the vegetation changes in Africa, which appear resilient to fire, but
   there were complex systems in South America related to fires.}},

Abstract = {{Fire has become a frequent tool in nature conservation and hazard
   reduction, but there is still dispute about the responses of many taxa,
   especially concerning invertebrate populations. While the effects of
   fire on plants and animals have been examined intensively in prairies,
   savannahs and coniferous forests, wetlands have rarely been considered
   in this context, yet wetland ecosystems do experience periodic fires.
   This study examines the effects of prescribed burning and wildfires on
   Orthoptera in four Central European peat bogs. All species persisted on
   the burned plots and none experienced a massive decline in abundance
   compared to unburned treatments. Generally, differences in species
   composition and abundance were more distinct between the bogs than
   between the fire treatments or fire season. One threatened species,
   Omocestus rufipes, occurred more often in burned than in unburned
   samples. The abundances of Orthoptera species in the transition zone
   between burned and unburned plots were either uniform or step-like
   rather than gradual in nature, conflicting with a hypothesis of
   post-fire recolonization from unburned plots. This pattern supported by
   non-metric multidimensional scaling suggests that the vegetation
   structure plays a substantial role in habitat choice of these insects.
   Small-scale fires between February and May do not seem to represent a
   threat to Orthoptera species. However, in the longer term, peat bog
   restoration may be affected by negative vegetation responses.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important disturbance process in western North American
   conifer forests. To better understand forest response to fire, we used
   generalized additive models to analyze tree mortality and long-term (1
   to 25 years post-fire) radial growth patterns of trees that survived
   fire across a burn severity gradient in the western Cascades of Oregon.
   We also used species-specific leaf-area models derived from sapwood
   estimates to investigate the linkage between photosynthetic capacity and
   growth response. Larger trees and shade intolerant trees had a higher
   probability of surviving fire. Trees that survived fire tended to
   experience a reduction in growth immediately following fire, with the
   most pronounced growth suppression found in trees within stands burned
   at high severity. Radial growth response to fire over time differed
   markedly as a function of tree size. Smaller trees that survived fire
   generally experienced enhanced radial growth relative to small trees in
   unburned stands. Conversely, larger trees that survived fire experienced
   significant and persistent reductions in growth relative to large trees
   in unburned stands. There was a linear relationship between diameter and
   tree leaf area in stands burned at low severity, but a non-linear
   relationship between diameter and leaf area in stand burned at high
   severity. Generalized additive models are well suited to modeling
   non-linear mortality and growth responses to fire. This research
   provides a better understanding of how fire severity influences
   tree-growth, forest succession, as well as the long-term resilience of
   forests to disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{For four consecutive years, following the fires in November 1993,
   temporal variations in species richness, cover and biomass of component
   plant groups in early post-fire chaparral succession were monitored on
   different aspects at the Stunt Ranch Santa Monica Mountains Reserve,

   strategies. North-facing slopes exhibited higher species richness,
   higher species turnover rate over time and faster vegetation recovery in
   terms of biomass accumulation and return to pre-fire species
   composition. This was probably due to higher species richness and
   biomass of nitrogen-fixing species found on north-facing slopes in
   comparison to south-facing slopes. On both north- and south-facing
   slopes, annuals had the highest species turnover rate, followed by
   herbaceous perennials and shrubs. In the first four post-fire years,
   annual species were the largest floristic group, but herbaceous
   perennials and shrubs were the major contributors to community biomass.
   Nitrogen-fixing species and exotics contributed significantly to early

Abstract = {{Pinus pinaster (maritime pine) is widely planted in the Mediterranean
   Basin. Maritime pine forests' carbon stocks are dynamic because of the
   effect of wildfires and timber activities. Management practices offer an
   opportunity to mitigate climate change via increasing carbon storage in
   various ecosystems. In this work, we quantified carbon pools in P.
   pinaster forests in relation to fire occurrence and different post-fire
   salvage logging techniques. For this, we studied an area in northern
   Portugal where different parts had burned zero, one and four times
   during the last three decades. Following the last fire in 2012, two
   salvage logging treatments were carried out: (1) typical logging where
   all logs and tree biomass were removed and (2) conservation logging
   where burned tree branches were left in piles and log extraction was
   restricted to specific extraction trails. We assessed the carbon stocks
   for the aboveground and belowground compartments, taking into account
   their different components (vegetation, litter, roots and soil organic
   carbon). Our main findings were, firstly, that recurrent fires can be
   catastrophic in terms of carbon sequestration if the overstory dominated
   by P. pinaster does not regenerate after fire (2.4 times less).
   Secondly, soil organic carbon constituted an important carbon pool,
   being the most important when pines are eliminated due to recurrent
   fires with short intervals (90-95 \%). Finally, the conservation
   technique applied here, leaving piles of branches on the soil surface,
   would be a suitable measure to increase carbon storage, at least in the
   short term, but might interfere with the recruitment of the pine stand.}},

Abstract = {{High-severity wildfires increasingly influence forests in the western
   United States. Extensive research has identified preventative practices
   including mechanical and prescribed fire treatments to reduce wildfire
   severity in mature stands. Yet limited research has investigated fuel
   management treatments in young stands which can be particularly
   vulnerable to even low intensity fire. To address this gap, we
   investigated how prescribed fire (conducted in both the spring and fall)
   and pre-treatment fuel modifications impacted individual tree damage (or
   injury) and mortality in nine 13-14 year old mixed conifer stands in the
   central Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Prior to burning, randomly
   selected trees were pruned to 1.8 m height above ground. Randomly
   selected trees were also raked to reduce surrounding surface fuel.
   Raking fuel from trees reduced the amount of crown volume scorched for
   all species, but not enough trees died to determine if raking influenced
   probability of survival. Pruning was associated with reductions in crown
   consumption height and percent crown volume consumed (5\% of crown
   volume in pruned versus <1\% of crown volume unpruned, p = 0.02) but was
   not a significant predictor of percent of crown volume scorched brown.
   Pruned trees had only 27\% of the mortality of unpruned trees when less
   than half of the crown was scorched (p = 0.046). However the mortality
   of pruned trees showed no less sensitivity to fire damage at higher
   levels of crown scorch (p = 0.0076); in fact extremely scorched trees
   appeared more likely to die when pruned. Mortality differed strongly by
   species; giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) showed 97\% post-fire
   survival while nearly half of sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana) died.
   Fires occurring in spring months killed seven times as many trees as
   those in autumn months. While the results demonstrate that prescribed
   burns can be feasible in stands as young as 13 years old, the factors of
   post-fire damage and mortality are different compared to mature stands.
   Species composition, pre-fire fuel reduction treatments, and timing of
   prescribed burns are all important considerations for managers wanting
   to develop resilient young stands with prescribed fire. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Question: How does fire affect the aggregation patterns of trees in a
   species-poor oak woodland?
   Location: East-central Minnesota, USA.
   Methods: More than 10000 trees with DBH > 2 cm (comprising more than
   11000 stems) were monitored in a 16-ha grid on an annual basis from
   1995- 2001 in a species-poor temperate woodland. Different portions of
   the grid experienced different frequencies of controlled burns.
   Aggregation indices were calculated for individual species and
   individual size classes within species. A community-wide aggregation
   index was also calculated for different burn units. Spatial data were
   managed. and many of the aggregation indices calculated using a GIS
   ArcInfo (TM) (ESRI).
   Results: Fire initially increased clumping, although repeated fires
   reduced it, a finding that suggests a corollary to the
   intermediate-disturbance hypothesis, the corollary stating that
   intermediate levels of disturbance are expected to maximize
   community-wide patterns of aggregation. Analyses also showed that all
   species are aggregated at small scales, that the degree of aggregation
   of a stem type (species or size) declines with distance from individual
   stems, that the degree of aggregation of large stems is usually less
   than that of small stems, and that rare species are more aggregated than
   common species. Findings from this study are consistent with those from
   similar studies in other temperate and tropical forests, woodlands, and
   savannas.
   Conclusion: The spatial patterns of trees in this woodland are dynamic,
   continually changing in response to the relative strengths of the often
   opposing forces of competition, which tends to reduce clumping, and
   disturbance, which, at low and intermediate frequencies, tends to
   increase it.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fuels in the groundcover of frequently burned south-eastern pine
   savannas include shed leaves of trees. Flammable needles of longleaf
   pine (Pinus palustris) potentially increase maximum fire temperatures
   and durations of heating, negatively affecting other trees within the
   groundcover. Less flammable leaves that accumulate around the bases of
   understorey stems of hardwood trees such as mockernut hickories (Carya
   alba) in the fall potentially depress maximum fire temperatures and
   durations of heating, enhancing post-fire recovery.
   2. We experimentally manipulated amounts of pine and hickory leaves
   beneath understorey hickory stems in a pine savanna, measured
   temperatures during prescribed fires and assessed combustion of fuels
   and survival and regrowth of hickory stems.
   3. Pine needles increased fire temperatures and durations of heating
   relative to herbaceous fuels and increased combustion of hickory leaves.
   Hickory leaves, however, neither increased nor decreased fire
   characteristics relative to herbaceous fuels.
   4. All hickories survived fire by resprouting. When pine needles were
   absent, most hickories resprouted from buds located above-ground along
   the stem at heights inversely related to temperature increase. In
   contrast, resprouting occurred only from underground root crowns when
   pine needles were present. Such differences in locations of resprouts
   influenced sizes of stems at the end of the growing season.
   5. Synthesis. Groundcover fuels containing flammable leaves shed by
   pyrogenic species of savanna trees affect local fire characteristics and
   resprouting of non-pyrogenic understorey trees. Thus, local variation in
   flammable fuels produced by pyrogenic species can engineer landscape
   dynamics of other trees in savannas.}},

   study, Larix occidentalis saplings were subjected to different levels of
   water stress followed by low-intensity surface fires in a controlled

   water-stressed saplings whose foliage had senesced before the fires had
   lower 1-year mortality (14\%) and significantly greater post-fire bud
   densities than moderately stressed saplings that did not senesce (86\%

Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Fires that burn through forests cause changes in wood anatomy and growth
   that can be used to reconstruct fire histories. Fire is important in
   Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl. (coast redwood) forests, but fire
   histories are limited due to difficulties crossdating annual rings of
   this species. Here we investigated three fires (1985, 1999, 2008) in two
   old-growth forests (Montgomery Woods State Natural Reserve and
   Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve, California, USA) to quantify these
   responses via crossdated increment cores from lower trunks of 53 trees,
   including 10 that were climbed and cored at 10 m height intervals.
   Redwoods frequently responded to fire by producing anomalous growth
   during the fire year; 100 of 240 lower trunk cores recorded at least one
   anatomical indicator (i.e., intra-annual density fluctuation, faint
   latewood, resin, or scar). Following fire, radial growth decreased by
   29\% to 43\% compared to the fire year. After accounting for climatic
   influences, radial growth was 27\% to 32\% lower than expected in the
   post-fire year and declined to as low as 46\% after three years. Growth
   suppression persisted for up to seven years after fire, followed by up
   to 40\% higher than expected radial growth. Several of the climbed trees
   expressed disruption of incremental growth along the height gradient
   following fire. The 1985 event consistently generated stronger growth
   and anatomical responses than the 1999 and 2008 events, and showed a
   co-occurrence between faint latewood during the fire year and subsequent
   narrow or missing rings. We used post-fire low growth relative to
   drought combined with anatomical indicators to detect past fires,
   identifying five additional events at Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve
   dating back to 1634. Although other disturbances could have initiated
   these responses, our detection method enhances current capabilities for
   the spatiotemporal resolution of redwood fire histories via non-scar
   indicators on increment cores from living redwoods.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and richness of a plant community and its changes are
   among the factors that can directly or indirectly affect ant fauna
   richness. This work investigated effects of variations in vegetation
   structure and richness on ant population richness during the process of
   forest succession in the Amazonia region. Sampling was performed in the
   state of Acre, at the experimental Preserve of Catuaba (REC) in areas of
   primary forest (mata), secondary forest approximately 16 years old
   (capoeira), secondary forest experimentally deforested, burnt and
   cleared (regeneration) and in a farm area (matrix) composed of a mosaic
   (pastures, roads, construction, and forest borders). The faunistic
   inventory and analyses of 10 variables of vegetation structure were
   performed. Upon evaluation of ant richness in all 10 samplings (temporal
   analysis), it was observed that in areas where the higher number of
   species was collected, there was a tendency for always having the
   greatest richness in all the samplings (Kendall's concordance
   coefficient W = 0.621; p = 0.000; df = 11). Comparison of ant richness
   between the three replications for the four treatments (spatial
   analysis) demonstrated that the values were not significant (Kendall's
   concordance coefficient W = 0.778; p = 0.072; df = 3). The variables
   tree density, basal area, canopy cover, shrub density and tree height
   were predictive for explaining richness of ant fauna, and tree height
   was the best predictive variable. Tree stem density, tree diameter,
   shrub height, bamboo culm density and flora richness were not
   significant. Changes in vegetation structure affected ant species
   richness in the REC. These changes were more noticeable in areas of
   regeneration, and their surrounding areas were more important for the
   re-colonization by the fauna and flora. The definition of the predicting
   variables for richness of ant fauna is an important tool for future
   studies of environmental impact and use and preservation of land in the
   Amazonia region.}},

Abstract = {{Mountainous topography creates fine-scale environmental mosaics that
   vary in precipitation, temperature, insolation, and slope position. This
   mosaic in turn influences fuel accumulation and moisture and forest
   structure. We studied these the effects of varying environmental
   conditions across a 27,104 ha landscape within Yosemite National Park,
   California, USA, on the number of fires and burn severity (measured from
   Landsat data for 1984-2010) and on canopy cover at two heights (>2 m and
   2-8 m) and dominant tree height (measured with airborne LiDAR data). We
   used site water balance (actual evapotranspiration and climatic water
   deficit) and topography (slope position, slope, and insolation) as
   environmental predictors. Random forest modeling showed that
   environmental conditions predicted substantial portions of the
   variations in fire and forest structure: e.g., 85-93\% of the variation
   in whether a location did not burn, burned once, or burned twice; 64\%
   of the variation in the burn severity; and 72\% of the variation in
   canopy cover >2 m for unburned forests, 64\% for once-burned forests,
   and 59\% for twice-burned forests. Environmental conditions also
   predicted a substantial portion of forest structure following one and
   two fires, even though the post-fire forest structures were
   substantially different than pre-fire structures. This suggests a
   feedback mechanism in which local fire regimes and pre-fire forest
   structures are related to local environments, and their interaction
   produces post-fire structures also related to local environments. Among
   environmental predictors, water balance had the greatest explanatory
   power, followed by slope position, and then by slope and insolation.
   Managers could use our methods to help select reference areas that match
   environmental conditions, identify areas at risk for fires that endanger
   critical habitat or other resources, and identify climate analog areas

Abstract = {{Background Fire has historically shaped the dynamics of Araucaria
   araucana-Nothofagus pumilio forests in the Andean region of South
   America. Nevertheless, human disturbances and stronger drought events
   have resulted in increased occurrence and severity of wildfires.
   Regardless of their conservation relevance, the initial response to fire
   of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests has not been well documented. Through
   this research we tested the hypothesis that plant composition of
   Araucaria-Nothofagus forest after fire will initially differ in its
   recovery depending on fire severity, but over time, plant similarity
   will increase among areas with different levels of fire severity. The
   study was carried out in old-growth Araucaria-Nothofagus forests in
   south-central Chile (38 degrees S) that were burned in 2015. We studied
   vegetation response to three levels of fire severity (low (LS), moderate
   (MS) and high (HS) severity), also including an adjacent unburned forest
   (UN), which were assessed one, two and three years after fire. We also
   evaluated the impact of cattle on plant recovery after fire. We measured
   species richness, abundance, plant diversity and origin of all vascular
   plant species. Results Species richness and plant abundance responded
   differently to fire severity. Time-since-fire had a significant effect
   on plant richness and abundance. Plant composition within LS areas was
   similar to UN areas, but MS and HS areas were significantly less diverse
   compared to UN and LS. In absence of other major disturbances,
   similarity in plant composition tended to increase over time across the
   different levels of fire severity, becoming more similar to UN. We also
   found a synergetic effect of cattle and fire on species richness. This
   interaction promotes the establishment of non-native species and limits
   the recovery of native species following fire. Conclusions Fire severity
   had a significant impact on the plant community of old-growth
   Araucaria-Nothofagus forests, especially in areas of high fire severity,
   where the native tree N. pumilio was completely absent. Nevertheless,
   plant communities can recover gradually, depending on fire severity,
   time-since-fire, and the absence of cattle grazing. Management actions
   should include the exclusion of cattle within fire-affected areas and
   afforestation with N. pumilio in areas high fire severity due to its
   unsuccessful recruitment after fire.}},

Pages = {{21-30}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are well-known to increase runoff and erosion during the
   initial stages of the window-of-disturbance, and mulching has been
   widely documented to effectively minimize this impact. However, the
   relationship between the rate of mulch application and erosion reduction
   is poorly studied, in spite of its potential importance for optimizing
   mulching costs and efforts per ha. Therefore, a field experiment was
   carried out in a recently burnt eucalypt plantation in Central Portugal
   that had been burnt by a moderate severity fire during August 2015,
   comparing sediment as well as organic matter losses from three untreated
   2 m x 8 m erosion plots with losses from six plots mulched with eucalypt
   logging residues at two contrasting rates of either 2.6 or 8.0 Mg
   ha(-1). The two mulching treatments resulted in the targeted litter
   covers of 50 and 79\%, and these covers hardly changed over the ensuing
   year. Over this first post-fire year, the mulched plots produced
   significantly less mineral soil as well as organic matter losses than
   the untreated plots. At the same time, the plots with the high mulching
   rate lost consistently less sediments and organic matter than the plots
   with the low mulching rate but the differences were not statistically
   significant over all measurement periods. Total sediment losses over the
   first post-fire year were, on average, 86 and 96\% lower following
   mulching at 2.6 and 8.0 Mg ha(-1), respectively, than without mulching.
   In absolute values, total losses dropped from 8.0 to 1.1 and 0.3 Mg
   ha(-1) y(-1), respectively, or, in other words, similar to and
   well-below the widely-accepted threshold of tolerable soil loss of 1 Mg
   ha(-1) y(-1). If this threshold value is acceptable to land managers,
   they could treat a three times larger area with the same amount of
   mulch.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of fire-killed trees (i.e. post-fire or salvage logging) is
   often conducted in part to reduce woody fuel loads and mitigate
   potential reburn effects. Studies of post-salvage fuel dynamics have
   primarily used chronosequence or modelling approaches, with associated
   limitations; longitudinal studies tracking fuels over time have been
   rare. We resampled a network of post-fire plots, comprising a range of
   logging intensities, 10 years after the 2002 Biscuit Fire (Oregon, USA).
   For surface woody fuels, which started from large treatment differences
   immediately following logging (stepwise increases with harvest
   intensity), we found converging trends among treatments at 10 years,
   with convergence nearly complete for fine fuels but not for coarse
   fuels. Fire-killed snags for the dominant species (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii) decayed while standing at a statistically significant rate
   (single-exponential k=0.011), similar to or only slightly slower than
   down wood, suggesting that not all snag biomass will reach the forest
   floor. Live vegetation (largely resprouting sclerophyllous vegetation)
   is beginning to dominate surface fuel mass and continuity (>100\% cover)
   and likely moderates differences associated with woody fuels. Post-fire
   logging had little effect on live fuels or their change over time,
   suggesting high potential for stand-replacing early-seral fire
   regardless of post-fire harvest treatments.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative analysis of the impacts of prescribed fire on three upland
   forest stands in the Northeastern Atlantic Plain, NJ, USA, was
   conducted. Effects of prescribed fire on water use and gas exchange of
   overstory pines were estimated via sap-flux rates and photosynthetic
   measurements on Pinus rigida Mill. Each study site had two sap-flux
   plots, one experiencing prescribed fire and one control (unburned) plot
   for comparison before and after the fire. We found that photosynthetic
   capacity in terms of Rubisco-limited carboxylation rate and intrinsic
   water-use efficiency was unaffected, while light compensation point and
   dark respiration rate were significantly lower in the burned vs control
   plots post-fire. Furthermore, quantum yield in pines in the pine
   dominated stands was less affected than pines in the mixed oak/pine
   stand, as there was an increase in quantum yield in the oak/pine stand
   post-fire compared with the control (unburned) plot. We attribute this
   to an effect of forest type but not fire per se. Average daily sap-flux
   rates of the pine trees increased compared with control (unburned) plots
   in pine-dominated stands and decreased in the oak/pine stand compared
   with control (unburned) plots, potentially due to differences in fuel
   consumption and pre-fire sap-flux rates. Finally, when reference canopy
   stomatal conductance was analyzed, pines in the pine-dominated stands
   were more sensitive to changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while
   stomatal responses of pines in the oak/pine stand were less affected by
   VPD. Therefore, prescribed fire affects physiological functioning and
   water use of pines, but the effects may be modulated by forest stand
   type and fuel consumption pattern, which suggests that these factors may
   need to be taken into account for forest management in fire-dominated
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Landsat-based fire severity datasets are an invaluable resource for
   monitoring and research purposes. These gridded fire severity datasets
   are generally produced with pre- and post-fire imagery to estimate the
   degree of fire-induced ecological change. Here, we introduce methods to
   produce three Landsat-based fire severity metrics using the Google Earth
   Engine (GEE) platform: The delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR), the
   relativized delta normalized burn ratio (RdNBR), and the relativized
   burn ratio (RBR). Our methods do not rely on time-consuming a priori
   scene selection but instead use a mean compositing approach in which all
   valid pixels (e.g., cloud-free) over a pre-specified date range (pre-
   and post-fire) are stacked and the mean value for each pixel over each
   stack is used to produce the resulting fire severity datasets. This
   approach demonstrates that fire severity datasets can be produced with
   relative ease and speed compared to the standard approach in which one
   pre-fire and one post-fire scene are judiciously identified and used to
   produce fire severity datasets. We also validate the GEE-derived fire
   severity metrics using field-based fire severity plots for 18 fires in
   the western United States. These validations are compared to
   Landsat-based fire severity datasets produced using only one pre- and
   post-fire scene, which has been the standard approach in producing such
   datasets since their inception. Results indicate that the GEE-derived
   fire severity datasets generally show improved validation statistics
   compared to parallel versions in which only one pre-fire and one
   post-fire scene are used, though some of the improvements in some
   validations are more or less negligible. We provide code and a sample
   geospatial fire history layer to produce dNBR, RdNBR, and RBR for the 18
   fires we evaluated. Although our approach requires that a geospatial
   fire history layer (i.e., fire perimeters) be produced independently and
   prior to applying our methods, we suggest that our GEE methodology can
   reasonably be implemented on hundreds to thousands of fires, thereby
   increasing opportunities for fire severity monitoring and research

Abstract = {{Post-fire management practices after wildfires have an important impact
   on soil properties. Nevertheless, little research has been carried out.
   The aim of this study is to examine the impact of different
   post-wildfire forest management practices in a 10-month period
   immediately after a severe wildfire on soil properties. Two months after
   a wildfire, three experimental areas were designed, each one with
   different post-fire management: Cut and Remove (CR) where burned trunks
   were cut after fire and removed manually from the area; No Treatment
   (NT) where no intervention was carried out; and, Cut and Leave (CL)
   where burned trunks were cut and left randomly on topsoil. In each
   treatment, we collected nine samples (0-5 cm deep). In total, we sampled
   27 samples in each sampling date, two and ten months after the wildfire.
   The properties analyzed were aggregate stability (AS), total nitrogen
   (TN), soil organic matter (SOM), inorganic carbon (IC), C/N ratio, pH,
   electrical conductivity (EC), extractable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg),
   sodium(Na) and potassium(K). Soil C/N ratio was significantly higher in
   CR and CL treatments 10 months after fire comparing to 2 months after.
   On the other hand, pH, extractable Ca, Mg and K were significantly
   higher in all the treatments 2 months after fire than 10 months after.
   Aggregate stability, TN and SOM were significantly higher in CR
   comparing to CL, 10 months after the fire. IC was significantly higher
   in CL than in NT treatment, also, 10 months after the fire. Electrical
   conductivity was significantly higher in CR and CL treatments 2 months
   after fire comparing to 10 months after. According to the results, CR
   and CL post-fire management did not differ importantly from the NT
   scenario, showing that manual wood management does not have detrimental
   impacts on soil properties compared to mechanical operations. (c) 2018

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-79}},
Abstract = {{Wildland fire managers are often required to predict tree injury and
   mortality when planning a prescribed burn or when considering wildfire
   management options; and, currently, statistical models based on
   post-fire observations are the only tools available for this purpose.
   Implicit in the derivation of statistical models is the assumption that
   they are strictly applicable only for the species or conditions for
   which they were developed. The result has been a profusion of separate
   models of uncertain generality. A parallel research effort, the process
   approach, has been directed at modeling tree injury and mortality by
   directly simulating the energy-transfer process from the fire to the
   exterior surface of the plant, and thence into roots, stems, and
   foliage. Process models can currently predict stem or tree death if
   certain injury thresholds are reached. We present a brief review of the
   current understanding of the biophysical processes causing fire-induced
   plant injury, and focus on the challenges associated with defining
   boundary conditions, initial conditions, and thermal and physical
   properties required for modeling plant heating and tissue necrosis. We
   argue for integration of statistical and process approaches to
   predicting tree injury and mortality wherein process models provide
   inputs for statistical models. Research gaps that hinder the application
   of process-based tree injury and mortality models include linkage of
   fire effects models with combustion models (especially coupled
   fire-atmosphere models) through the boundary conditions required for
   simulating tissue heating, descriptions of live tree thermal and
   physical characteristics, and better understanding of the physiological
   basis for delayed fire-caused mortality and the interactions between
   fire injury and second-order causes of mortality such as diseases and
   insects.}},

   eucalypts dominated in later stages. Mean avian species richness and
   abundance increased significantly along the chronosequence, with values
   for the oldest rehabilitation plots being very similar to those for the
   off-mine plots. However, analyses of similarity revealed that the bird
   communities of the oldest rehabilitation plots were distinct from those
   of the off-mine plots, indicating that succession in rehabilitation
   areas is not following a direct trajectory toward the native open forest
   surrounding the mine. Several hollow-nesting bird species were scarce or
   absent in the rehabilitation areas, probably reflecting the absence of
   older hollow-bearing trees. Many differences between the rehabilitation
   and the off-mine areas in vegetation structure, woody flora, and
   avifauna appear to be related to the exclusion of fire from the
   minesite. We recommend the initiation of experiments designed to assess
   the effects of fire on the biota but caution against the use of fires
   for the majority of rehabilitation areas.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1998 and 2002, six sites were established immediately after
   large wildfires in the western United States to determine the
   effectiveness of contour-felled log erosion barriers in mitigating
   post-wildfire runoff and erosion. In each pair of matched, burned, and
   small watersheds ( 1-13 ha), one was treated with contour-felled log
   erosion barriers and one was left untreated as a control. For 4 to 6
   post-fire years, runoff and sediment yields were measured and correlated
   with rain properties. High-intensity rainfall produced most of the
   measured runoff and sediment yields except in the southern California
   site, where long-duration rain events produced most of the runoff and
   erosion. For small rain events ( less than the 2-year return period for
   the 10-min duration), the runoff, peak flows, and sediment yields were
   lower in the treated watersheds than in the control watersheds, but
   there was no treatment effect for rain events with larger return
   periods. Improper installation and degradation over time reduced the
   effectiveness of contour-felled log erosion barriers. Rainfall
   characteristics and installation procedures should be carefully
   considered before choosing contour-felled log erosion barriers for

Abstract = {{Soil seed bank is an important source of resilience of plant communities

   asked if the fire affected seed abundance, floristic and functional
   composition of the soil seed bank at two different layers (0-5cm and
   5-10cm), and if fire could compromise the role of the soil seed bank as
   a source of resilience for the vegetation. We collected soil samples
   from a burned site and from a control site that had not burned. Samples
   were installed in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. During
   12months, we recorded all germinated seedlings. We compare soil seed
   bank with pre-fire vegetation in terms of floristic and functional
   composition. The high-intensity fire deeply affected the abundance of
   seeds in the soil, but it did not affect its floristic or functional
   composition. Floristic and functional composition of soil seed banks -
   at burned and unburned sites- differed markedly from that of the
   pre-fire vegetation, although a previous study at the same site
   indicated high resilience after fire of this plant community. Our

Journal = {{FORESTS}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In 1992, in Southern Poland, large areas of Silesian forests were
   affected by the country's largest forest fire. Stands introduced in the
   9000-ha post-fire region are currently undergoing early thinning. Due to
   the scope of these treatments, the chance for their timely
   implementation is ensured only by the application of cut-to-length (CTL)
   technologies, i.e., with the use of harvesters and forwarders. The use
   of CTL technologies may, however, be difficult due to the fire history
   of these stands, which could affect the bearing capacity of their soils.
   The objective of this study is to determine the accessibility of stands
   for forest machines in relation to the bearing capacity of the soils and
   changes in soil compaction in the post-fire sites. Soil compaction was
   measured in terms of penetrometer resistance in the stands introduced in
   the post-fire area in question, as well as in control stands growing on
   five different soil types. It was shown that in the topsoil layer-from 8
   to 18 cm thick depending on the soil type-differences in soil compaction
   in the post-fire and control areas were relatively small. The impacts of
   the forest fire-manifested as a significant increase in the compaction
   of the forest soils-were still visible, but only in the deeper layers of
   the soil profile. In all of the compared pairs of forest compartments
   located in the stands regenerated after the fire, significantly higher
   values of cone indexes (CI) were found. The average value of this index
   in the post-fire stands was 2.15 MPa, while in the control stands it was
   1.60 MPa, which indicates that in both groups of stands the bearing
   capacity of the soils should not limit the accessibility for vehicles
   used for timber harvesting and extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Wild fires are a complex and unpredictable phenomenon. Post hoc
   estimation of wild fire intensity is important in understanding the
   ecological impact of fire on ecosystems and their post fire
   regeneration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a novel
   method for fire intensity estimation, based on measurements of post-fire
   ash pH and soil microarthropod community. Estimation of fire intensity
   by the novel method was compared to estimation by the mean minimum
   diameter of burned branch technique (MMDB), described by Moreno \&
   Oechel (1989). The study was carried out in a Pinus halepensis Mill.
   forest on Mt. Carmel that burned in a wildfire in October 1998. The
   intensity of the fire was estimated by measuring thickness and pH of the
   ash layer under the canopy projection of burned trees, as well as by the
   MMDB technique. Variations in arthropod community were monitored in soil
   samples collected under the burned trees. Ash accumulation and increase
   of the ash layer pH were directly related to fire intensity. A positive
   correlation was found between the ash layer pH and minimum diameter of
   burned branches, with increasing fire intensities. A negative
   correlation was found between the size of microarthropod community and
   fire intensity, which also affected the composition of the arthropod
   community. Thus, estimation of fire intensity by integration of two
   factors, pH of the ash layer and composition of the microarthropod
   community, can give a wider understanding of fire impact on ecosystems.
   This integrated method is reliable, quick and inexpensive. Estimation of
   fire intensity can also be important for prediction of recovery time of
   the whole ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Forests sequester carbon from the atmosphere, helping mitigate climate
   change. In fire-prone forests, burn events result in direct and indirect
   emissions of carbon. High fire-induced tree mortality can cause a
   transition from a carbon sink to source, but thinning and prescribed
   burning can reduce fire severity and carbon loss when wildfire occurs.
   However, treatment implementation requires carbon removal and emissions
   to reduce high-severity fire risk. The carbon removed and emitted during
   treatment may be resequestered by subsequent tree growth, although there
   is much uncertainty regarding the length of time required. To assess the
   long-term carbon dynamics of thinning and burning treatments, we
   quantified the 10-year post-treatment carbon stocks and 10-year net
   biome productivity (NBP) from a full-factorial experiment involving
   three levels of thinning and two levels of burning in a mixed-conifer
   forest in California's Sierra Nevada. Our results indicate that (1) the
   understory thin treatment, that retained large trees, quickly recovered
   the initial carbon emissions (NBP = 31.4 +/- 4.2 Mg C ha(-1)), (2) the
   carbon emitted from prescribed fire in the burn-only treatment was
   resequestered within the historical fire return interval (NBP = 32.8 +/-
   3.5 Mg C ha(-1)), and (3) the most effective treatment for reducing fire
   risk, understory thin and burn, had negative NBP (-6.0 +/- 4.5 Mg C
   ha(-1)) because of post-fire large tree mortality. Understory thinning
   and prescribed burning can help stabilize forest carbon and restore
   ecosystem resilience, but this requires additional emissions beyond only
   thinning or only burning. Retaining additional mid-sized trees may
   reduce the carbon impacts of understory thinning and burning.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the environmental effects of the use of wildland
   fire retardant is needed to provide informed decision-making regarding

   public domain. For streams near four major wildfires, we evaluated
   whether these chemicals originated primarily from fire or from retardant
   use. We compared measured concentrations in streams where chemical
   wildland fire retardant was applied with concentrations in streams
   draining areas where retardant was not used. Correlations with calcium
   provided an additional line of evidence, because calcium concentrations
   in ash are much higher than in retardant. Ammonia, phosphorus, and total
   cyanide were found in streams in burned areas where retardant was not
   used, at concentrations similar to those found in areas where retardant
   was applied. Concentrations of weak acid dissociable cyanide were
   generally non-detected or very low, whether or not wildland fire
   retardant was used in the watershed. These results indicate that the
   application of wildland fire retardant had minimal effects on proximate
   surface water quality. Cyanide concentrations in post-fire stormwater

Abstract = {{Salvage harvesting may represent an important additional impact on
   sediment and nutrient transfer in forest environments affected by
   wildfire. However, few studies have examined the effect of this
   management practice on stream water quality and catchment nutrient
   exports. In this paper, we investigate nutrient losses following
   post-wildfire salvage harvesting of a radiata pine plantation catchment
   compared to an adjacent natural eucalypt forest catchment that was also
   burnt but not harvested. The study catchments form part of the long-term
   Cropper Creek Hydrology Project (established in 1975) that is situated
   in south-eastern Australia. Post-fire monitoring(2007-2009) involved
   collection of both weekly and flow proportional water samples that were
   compared with previously reported data from samples collected prior to
   the fire (1997-2003). It was found that median values of total suspended
   solids (TSS) and turbidity returned to pre-fire levels within 3 years in
   both catchments, whereas maximum levels during storm events in the
   harvested pine catchment continued to exceed the eucalypt catchment.
   This reflected a previously reported large increase in post-fire
   sediment exports from the harvested pine catchment that was a minimum
   180 times the eucalypt catchment over the study period. In contrast, the
   impact of harvesting on solute concentrations (nitrate-N, P, S, Cl, Na,
   K, Ca, Mg) was minor and most solutes returned to pre-fire levels within
   2-3 years in both catchments. Nutrient exports from the pine catchment
   exceeded the eucalypt catchment by 102 times for particulate P
   associated with suspended material compared to 1.9-4 times for solutes.
   The post-fire changes in solute concentrations were generally similar
   for both catchments and the increase in solute exports was largely a
   result of greater discharge after the fire and harvesting compared to
   the burnt eucalypt catchment. The post-fire loss of particulate P in
   suspended sediment and bedload from the pine catchment for the study
   period was estimated at a minimum of 11 kg ha(-1) and together with the
   estimated loss of P from burning and the removal of the pines
   represented approximately 6\% of the total Pin surface soil and
   fertilizer applied to the plantation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   SubCs after the wildfire (PostF-1), the salvage logging and the new skid
   trails (PostF-2), and the development of new gullies (PostF-3). Check
   dams reduced connectivity but did not prevent the general trend.
   Afterwards, the incipient (PostF-4 and PostF-5) and future vegetation
   recovery made slightly decrease HC. In the three forestry SubCs with
   check dams and large BA (67\% of the study area), connectivity markedly
   increased (11.4\%, 18.2\% and 22.9\%) during the three first post-fire

   per plot increased in canopy-fire-burned areas, but per plot species
   richness, diversity, and dominance were not affected by fire. Species
   composition varied depending on fire intensity. Some species were
   associated with canopy fire and low vegetation cover. Other species were
   associated with shrub cover and time since fire. Finally, some species
   were not dependent on fire or vegetation cover. Beetle abundance in
   burned areas was independent of time since fire. This lack of
   medium-term convergence between burned and unburned P.nigra forest

   increased with longer fire intervals, i.e. with fuel accumulation and
   potentially higher fire intensity. MFI (accounting for 70\% of the
   explanation), terrain aspect, and MaxFI explained 55\% of plot-level
   variation in CKH using regression tree analysis. MFI <4.2 years
   generated the lowest CKH. For stands with MFI >= 4.2 years, CKH
   increased on slopes facing east or south (drier and warmer) and was
   highest when MaxFI >= 4.8 years. Active crown fire was less likely in
   forest patches stocked at <20 m(2) ha(-1) and <200 ha(-1), which should
   decrease crown fire hazard and limit high-severity fire if combined with
   adequate pruning and surface fuel treatments every 3-5 years. The study
   indicates that patches surviving a first-entry wildfire are likely to
   persist under a frequent fire regime, adding to the understanding of
   Mediterranean pines resilience to fire and providing quantitative
   empirical evidence useful to guide the management of fire-prone forests.

Abstract = {{The number of wildland-urban interface communities affected by wildfire
   is increasing, and both wildfire suppression and losses are costly.
   However, little is known about post-wildfire response by homeowners and
   communities after buildings are lost. Our goal was to characterise
   rebuilding and new development after wildfires across the conterminous
   United States. We analysed all wildfires in the conterminous USA from
   2000 to 2005. We mapped 42 724 buildings, of which 34 836 were present
   before the fire and survived, 3604 were burned, 2403 were post-fire new
   development, and 1881 were burned and rebuilt. Before the fires, 38 440
   buildings were present within fire perimeters (surviving plus burned).
   Within 5 years post-fire, there were 39 120 buildings (surviving,
   rebuilt and new development). Nationally, only 25\% of burned homes were
   rebuilt within 5 years, though rates were higher in the west, the south
   and Kansas. New development rates inside versus outside fire perimeters
   were similar. That the number of buildings inside fire perimeters within
   5 years post-fire was greater than pre-fire indicated that homeowners
   are either willing to face wildfire risks or are unaware of them; or
   that economic incentives to rebuild in the same place outweigh perceived
   risks.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly frequent ``megafires{''} in North America's dry forests
   have prompted proposals to restore historical fire regimes and ecosystem
   resilience. Restoration efforts that reduce tree densities (eg via

   fires remains uncertain. We demonstrate the effects of a 2014 California
   megafire on an iconic old-forest species, the spotted owl (Strix
   occidentalis). The probability of owl site extirpation was seven times
   higher after the fire (0.88) than before the fire (0.12) at severely
   burned sites, contributing to the greatest annual population decline
   observed during our 23-year study. The fire also rendered large areas of
   forest unsuitable for owl foraging one year post-fire. Our study
   suggests that megafires pose a threat to old-forest species, and we
   conclude that restoring historical fire regimes could benefit both
   old-forest species and the dry forest ecosystems they inhabit in this

   artificially seeded after high-intensity fire in a dry Abies grandis
   (Dougl.) Lindl. forest in the northeastern Cascades. Seeding with a mix
   of non-native grasses and a legume significantly reduced the cover of
   native plants and shifted patterns of relative abundance after 2 years.
   Although seeding did not significantly affect total cover or native
   species richness, it reduced overall native plant cover by 47\%. Species
   that recolonize via wind-dispersed seeds (e.g., Epilobium angustifolium
   L., Lactuca serriola L., and Arenaria macrophylla Hook.), species with
   long-lived seeds that germinate after fire (e.g., Ceanothus velutinus
   Dougl.), and species with wide successional amplitudes that resprout
   after fire (e.g., Apocynum androsaemifolium L. and Salix scouleriana
   Barratt) all declined steeply in cover on seeded plots. In addition,
   conifer seedlings were only half as abundant on seeded plots. As seeding
   after fire does not boost total plant cover and limits conifer tree
   establishment on the study area, it appears to do little to reduce the
   risk of soil erosion. It also appears to inhibit native shrub and herb
   re-establishment. These substantial effects on native species appear to
   alter plant communities well beyond the life of the seeded species.}},

Abstract = {{The December 2010 forest fire on Mount Carmel - the largest recorded in
   Israel - burned about 2500 ha of Mediterranean forest. We documented the
   immediate and short-term changes of the vegetation following this fire.
   Relative vegetation cover and plant species richness were sampled in
   five sites in spring 2009 and 2010, prior to the fire, and were
   re-sampled in 2011 and 2012. The number of recurrent fires ( between 0
   and 3) and time intervals between fires were documented for each site.
   We observed a strong decrease in total vegetation cover, associated with
   reduction of relative cover of woody vegetation. In the second year
   after the fire, shrubs and dwarf shrubs became dominant at all sites.
   Time intervals between fires played an important role in determining the
   extent of regeneration of the vegetation cover and plant species
   richness. Plant species richness immediately decreased after the fire in
   sites with a short fire interval, while in sites with a long fire
   interval, plant species richness increased. Relative plant cover was
   associated with the time from the last previous fire, and this
   association differed among different plant groups. These results suggest
   that vegetation and plant community regeneration after recurrent fires
   is accelerated when time intervals between fires are longer, whereas
   high fire frequency may suppress vegetation regeneration. Based on the
   results, we propose that forest regeneration after recurrent fires
   depends largely on time from the previous fire, rather than on the
   number of previous fires. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fire impacts many vegetated ecosystems across the world. The severity of
   a fire is major component in determining post-fire effects, including
   soil erosion, trace gas emissions, and the trajectory of recovery. In
   this study, we used imaging spectroscopy data combined with Multiple
   Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA), a form of spectral mixture
   analysis that accounts for endmember variability, to map fire severity
   of the 2013 Rim Fire. We evaluated four endmember selection approaches:
   Iterative Endmember Selection (IES), count-based within endmember class
   (In-CoB), Endmember Average Root Mean Squared Error (EAR), and Minimum
   Average Spectral Angle (MASA). To reduce the dimensionality of the
   imaging spectroscopy data we used uncorrelated Stable Zone Unmixing
   (uSZU). Fractional cover maps derived from MESMA were validated using
   two approaches: (1) manual interpretation of fine spatial resolution
   WorldView-2 imagery; and (2) ground plots measuring the Geo Composite
   Burn Index (GeoCBI) and the percentage of co-dominant and dominant trees
   with green, brown, and black needles. Comparison to reference data
   demonstrated fairly high correlation for green vegetation and char
   fractions (r(2) values as high as 0.741 for the MESMA ash fractions
   compared to classified WorldView-2 imagery and as high as 0.841 for
   green vegetation fractions). The combination of uSZU band selection and
   In-CoB endmember selection had the best trade-off between accuracy and
   computational efficiency. This study demonstrated that detailed fire
   severity retrievals based on imaging spectroscopy can be optimized using
   techniques that would be viable also in a satellite-based imaging

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important tool in the management of ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests, yet effects on bark beetle
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) activity and tree mortality are
   poorly understood in the southwestern U.S. We compared bark beetle
   attacks and tree mortality between paired prescribed-burned and unburned
   stands at each of four sites in Arizona and New Mexico for three growing
   seasons after burning (2004-2006). Prescribed bums increased bark beetle
   attacks on ponderosa pine over the first three post-fire years from 1.5
   to 13\% of all trees, increased successful, lethal attacks on ponderosa
   pine from 0.4 to 7.6\%, increased mortality of ponderosa pine from all
   causes from 0.6 to 8.4\%, and increased mortality of all tree species
   with diameter at breast height > 13 cm from 0.6 to 9.6\%. On a per year
   basis, prescribed bums increased ponderosa pine mortality from 0.2\% per
   year in unburned stands to 2.8\% per year in burned stands. Mortality of
   ponderosa pine 3 years after burning was best described by a logistic
   regression model with total crown damage (crown scorch + crown
   consumption) and bark beetle attack rating (no, partial, or mass attack
   by bark beetles) as independent variables. Attacks by Dendroctonus spp.
   did not differ significantly over bole heights, whereas attacks by Ips
   spp. were greater on the upper bole compared with the lower bole. Three
   previously published logistic regression models of tree mortality,
   developed from fires in 1995-1996 in northern Arizona, were moderately
   successful in predicting broad patterns of tree mortality in our data.
   The influence of bark beetle attack rating on tree mortality was
   stronger for our data than for data from the 1995-1996 fires. Our
   results highlight canopy damage from fire as a strong and consistent
   predictor of post-fire mortality of ponderosa pine, and bark beetle
   attacks and bole char rating as less consistent predictors because of
   temporal variability in their relationship to mortality. The small
   increase in tree mortality and bark beetle attacks caused by prescribed
   burning should be acceptable to many forest managers and the public
   given the resulting reduction in surface fuel and risk of severe
   wildfire. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Outbreak in Colorado, USA}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{The frequency, magnitude, and size of forest disturbances are increasing
   globally. Much recent research has focused on how the occurrence of one
   disturbance may affect susceptibility to subsequent disturbances. While
   much has been learned about such linked disturbances, the strength of
   the interactions is likely to be contingent on the severity of
   disturbances as well as climatic conditions, both of which can affect
   disturbance intensity and tree resistance to disturbances. Subalpine
   forests in western Colorado were affected by extensive and severe
   wildfires in the late 19th century and an extensive and severe outbreak
   of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) in the 1940s. Previous
   research found that most, but not all, of the stands that burned and
   established following the late 19th century fires were not susceptible
   to the 1940s outbreak as beetles preferentially attack larger trees and
   stands in advanced stages of development. However, previous research
   also left open the possibility that some stands that burned and
   established following the 19th century fires may have been attacked
   during the 1940s outbreak. Understanding how strongly stand structure,
   as shaped by disturbances of varying severity, affected susceptibility
   to past outbreaks is important to provide a baseline for assessing the
   degree to which recent climate change may be relaxing the preferences of
   beetles for larger trees and for stands in latter stages of structural
   development and thereby changing the nature of linked disturbances.
   Here, dendroecological methods were used to study disturbance history
   and tree age of stands in the White River National Forest in Western
   Colorado that were identified in historical documents or remotely-sensed
   images as having burned in the 19th century and having been attacked by
   spruce beetle in the 1940s. Dendroecological reconstructions indicate
   that in young post-fire stands only old remnant trees that survived the
   otherwise stand-replacing fires were killed in the 1940s outbreak. No
   young post-fire trees (< ca. 128 years) were susceptible to the 1940s
   outbreak, implying that under the relatively cool and wet conditions of
   the mid-20th century, susceptibility to and spatial patterns of spruce
   beetle outbreak were most likely controlled by variations in severity of
   prior disturbance by fire. This study provides a baseline for comparing
   linked disturbances under the relatively warmer and drier conditions of
   recent (e.g. post-1990) outbreaks in order to assess how climate
   mitigates the degree to which pre-disturbance history and structure
   affect susceptibility to disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Drying floodplains that were not inundated for more than 10 y were
   investigated to relate plant species and vegetation structure to
   time-since-fire for the southern Okavango Delta wetland in Botswana. The
   aims of the research were to study post-fire succession on savanna
   habitats in the Okavango Delta and to investigate the mechanisms behind
   vegetation changes with time-since-fire. We hypothesize that vegetation
   structure rather than species occurrence is affected by the fixe event
   and that the driving forces of post-fire succession change from
   fire-driven to competition-driven with increasing time-since-fire. A
   total number of 153 study sites were investigated, representing areas of
   2-12 y without a fire. Both woody and herbaceous plant species were
   recorded and cover/abundance values were measured. The vegetation
   changes with time-since-fire could be assigned to three different
   successional stages: (1) the post-fire conditions shortly after fire,
   supporting high species numbers due to open space and little
   competition; (2) the dominance of competitive perennial grass species
   (e.g. Urochloa mosambicensis) after 6-8 y; and (3) the enhanced
   establishment of woody species after about 10 y, creating new habitats
   in their vicinity. High species numbers were found after short and long
   fire-free periods, and different species occurred shortly after the fire
   event and at late stages of the post-fire succession. A variety of
   different inter-fire intervals is therefore expected to be responsible
   for sustaining plant species richness and habitat diversity in the study
   area. Post-fire succession could be described as not only being driven
   by the life history of the species, but also by seedbank dynamics and
   plant mobility in early successional stages and by competition and niche
   differentiation in late-successional stages.}},

   effects on West Texas pinon-juniper woodlands}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{473}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Pinon-juniper (PJ) woodlands comprise an important and extensive
   dry-site forest cover-type that has historically experienced high
   spatiotemporal variation in fire frequency and extent. We re-measured a
   network of permanent monitoring plots in a fire-suppressed PJ site the
   Davis Mountains of West Texas after prescribed fire (Rx) treatments and
   three subsequent wildfires to 1) quantify wildfire effects on PJ
   woodland stand structure and fuel loadings, and 2) evaluate the effects
   of Rx fires followed by wildfire. Although fire weather was extreme
   during the wildfire years, all three wildfires burned as low-severity
   fire events. Simultaneous autoregressive modeling revealed that total
   tree density and basal area declined significantly (P < 0.05) over the
   time-series, while surface fuel loadings increased significantly (P <
   0.05), likely in response to fuel inputs from fire-induced tree
   mortality. However, tree mortality largely occurred in smaller tree
   size-classes (i.e. < 25 cm diameter at breast height). Neither fire
   severity, nor changes in stand structure varied significantly over the
   time-series among recent fire history types (i.e. no fire, Rx fire only,
   Rx fire + wildfire, or wildfire only) indicating that Rx fires had
   little effect on subsequent wildfire effects on forest structure or
   species composition. The low-severity nature of these recent wildfires
   under severe fire weather and in the wake of almost a century of fire
   suppression suggests that just because fires have been absent from a
   site for decades contemporary wildfires will not always result in fire
   regime characteristics that differ from historical fires in PJ-dominated
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major ecological factor altering soil properties that may
   remain for a long time. Little is known about the sensitivity to fire
   and post-fire recovery in soil microbial and biochemical properties in
   the semi-arid woodlands. The main objective of this study was to compare
   the changes in some microbial and biochemical properties in different
   years after fire. This study was conducted across a wildfire
   chronosequence in the semi-arid Zagros oak woodlands. We considered
   three fire treatments including 1, 3, and 10 years after fire. Then the
   soil samples were collected in a completely random design from each of
   the treatments. Soil microbial eco-physiological and enzymatic
   activities were measured for all the treatments and their relevant
   unburned control. The results indicated that soil organic carbon (Corg)
   decreased 1 year after fire (27\%) and still remained lower for 3 years
   after fire (22\%) and even for 10 years after (21\%) compared to the
   controls. Microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) significantly decreased (77\%)
   1 year after the fire, whereas the value of basal respiration (BR)
   remained unchanged. The value of Cmic for the treatments 3 and 10 years
   after fire recovered to the unburned level. 1 year after the fire the
   ratio of BR to Cmic (qCO2) was three times as much as the control.
   Although the value of BR was lower (p < 0.05) for the treatment 3 years
   after the fire, the value of qCO2 was higher (p < 0.05) compared to the
   control. The value of absolute enzyme activities was generally lower (p
   < 0.05) 1 year after the fire. However, it recovered 3 years after the
   fire to the unburned level. In comparison to the absolute enzyme
   activity, the specific enzyme activity showed a different trend and
   generally increased 1 year after the fire. The absolute activity of acid
   phosphatase (ACP) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) 10 years after the
   fire, while the ratio of ACP/Corg was higher (p < 0.05) compared to the
   control. It was concluded that specific activity of enzymes are more
   efficient indicators to reveal the post-fire changes in soil quality in

Abstract = {{Nutrients sorbed onto eroded sediment from small bounded plots installed
   in newly burned and unburned Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus pinaster

   fire on nutrient loss, (ii) the importance of fin-induced losses on soil
   fertility, and (iii) temporal variations in nutrient losses. Fire
   increased losses of total nitrogen, exchangeable potassium and available
   phosphorus by 3-4 orders of magnitude. This is attributed to increased
   erosion and high nutrient concentrations at the soil surface in the
   burned forests, where burning of organic matter and vegetation increased
   nutrient availability. Enhanced rates of loss were sustained for at
   least 3 years, resulting in much greater post-fire nutrient losses than
   reported in drier regions of the Mediterranean. Losses of available P
   had the greatest potential for reductions in soil fertility. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Patterns of past fire disturbance may be an important contributor to
   contemporary vegetation composition and structure in old-growth forests
   of the southern Appalachian Mountains. However, due to a lack of
   information on pre-suppression fire regimes, vegetation pattern in the
   region has been primarily attributed to variability in soils and
   climate. To assess the pre-suppression fire regime's role in shaping
   vegetation pattern, we characterized temporal patterns of tree
   establishment in an old-growth forest that experienced two centuries of
   frequent fire, followed by a century of fire exclusion. Forest plots
   were inventoried and cored to characterize age structure and composition
   in yellow pine, chestnut oak, white pine-oak, and cove forest
   communities on the south-facing slope of an old-growth watershed in
   Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee USA. We compared the
   timing and composition of tree establishment from the following
   disturbance periods: (1) frequent fire 1700-1909; (2) post fire
   1910-1949; and (3) mesophication 1950-2000. Non-metric multidimensional
   scaling characterized successional change between the three age classes.
   Multivariate dispersion, species richness, and beta diversity were
   calculated for establishment in each disturbance period. We found
   distinct peaks in tree establishment in the yellow pine, chestnut oak,
   and white pine-oak stand types that occurred soon (<40 years) after fire
   cessation at the site. Xerophytic fire-tolerant species dominated
   establishment during the period of frequent fire; a mixture of
   xerophytic and mesophytic species established during the period
   immediately following the last major fire; and mesophytic,
   fire-intolerant species dominated establishment during the recent period
   of mesophication. Cohort recruitment was less clearly linked to fire
   suppression in the mesic cove stands; however ``fire protected{''} cove
   stands exhibited different age structure and composition compared to
   cove stands adjacent to the frequently burned south-facing slope. Mean
   plot level species richness was greatest in the tree cohort that
   established soon after the last major fire; while beta diversity and
   multivariate dispersion were highest in the trees that had established
   during the frequent fire period. Tree establishment has generally
   shifted from shade-intolerant, drought-tolerant species to
   shade-tolerant, drought-intolerant species along the entire south-facing
   slope. Successional trajectory indicates a loss of yellow pine and
   chestnut oak communities as the xeric and sub-xeric sites convert to
   white pine and cove forest communities, which were formerly restricted
   to sub-mesic and mesic positions. Declines in beta diversity and
   multivariate dispersion within younger age classes indicate that in the
   absence of fire disturbance, community differentiation is declining
   along the topographic moisture gradient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   work we report the ecological responses of two small mammals to fire.
   During a six-year post-fire period, both species were studied by the
   capture-mark-recapture on a 9 ha quadrate established in a recently
   burned cork oak forest. The white-toothed-shrew, Crocidura russula, was
   the least resistant species to fire, disappearing completely during the
   first two years. Reappearing on the third year, the population
   maintained a low effective with the same fluctuation similar to that
   observed within the control. Although faster than on other studied
   mediterranean ecosystems, its allochthonous ristablishment on the burned
   cork oak forest, seems to be dependent on the litter reconstitution. Due
   to its rupicolous habits, its biotope specialization, highly favored by
   the presence of rocks on the capture quadrate, and some physiological
   apects (hibernation), the dormouse Eliomys quercinus, showed a better
   pre-adaptive response to the post-fire stress. The survival of a nucleus
   of autochtonous individuals insured, from the first year, a slow, but
   progressive recovery of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Dry woodlands frequently experience fire, and the heterogeneous spatial
   patterning of vegetation cover and fire behavior in these systems can
   lead to interspersed burned and unburned patches of different vegetation
   cover types. Biogeochemical processes may differ due to fire and
   vegetation cover influences on biotic and abiotic conditions, but these
   persistent influences of fire in the months or years following fire are
   not as well understood as the immediate impacts of fire. In particular,
   leaf litter decomposition, a process controlling nutrient availability
   and soil organic matter accumulation, is poorly understood in drylands
   but may be sensitive to vegetation cover and fire history. Decomposition
   is responsive to changes in abiotic drivers or interactions between
   abiotic conditions and biotic drivers, suggesting that decomposition
   rates may differ with vegetation cover and fire. The objective of this
   study was to assess the role of vegetation cover and fire on leaf litter
   decomposition in a semi-arid pinyon-juniper woodland in southern New
   Mexico, USA, where prescribed fire is used to combat increasing woody
   cover. A spatially heterogeneous prescribed burn led to closely
   co-located but discrete burned and unburned patches of all three
   dominant vegetation cover types (grass, shrub, tree). Decomposition
   rates of leaf litter from two species were measured in mesh litterbags
   deployed in factorial combination of the three vegetation cover types
   and two fire treatments (burned and unburned patches). For both litter
   types, decomposition was lower for unburned trees than for unburned
   grass or shrubs, perhaps due to greater soil-litter mixing and solar
   radiation away from tree canopies. Fire enhanced litter mass loss under
   trees, making decomposition rates similarly rapid in burned patches of
   all three vegetation cover types. Understanding decomposition dynamics
   in spatially heterogeneous vegetation cover of dry woodlands is critical
   for understanding biogeochemical process responses to fire in these
   systems.}},

   forest types, forest-floor treatments had no effect on community
   diversity or composition during the 2-year experiment. Sorensen
   similarities were as high as 97\% between posttreatment years within
   treatments; and successional vectors also provided little indication
   that treatments may appreciably affect longer-term successional
   trajectories. Lack of response to these fairly drastic treatments is
   surprising given these forests' exceptionally heavy Oi horizons and
   large proportions of conifer litter. Apparently shading, belowground
   competition for water or nutrients, or other tree-associated factors
   more strongly limit understory communities than does leaf litter. Based
   on sparse A-horizon seed banks averaging < 300 seeds . m(-2) and limited
   aboveground vegetation, we hypothesize that seed shortages, particularly
   for native perennials, also partly precluded a treatment response.
   Because extensive unvegetated areas at these restoration sites may be
   colonized by exotics, conservative management strategies could include
   testing the seeding or outplanting of desirable native species as an
   option for filling unoccupied microsites. Reporting of ``no treatment
   effect{''} experiments such as this one is important to avoid biasing
   meta-analyses, as is future research to clarify combinations of factors
   limiting understory communities. Increased understanding of these
   limiting factors may lead to identification of other treatments that

Abstract = {{Alpine treelines are expected to move upward in a warming climate, but

   ecotones extending from Abies lasiocarpa/Picea engelmannii forests at
   lower elevations, through Pinus albicaulis/Larix lyallii parkland, to
   alpine tundra. We estimated the probabilities of burning and transitions
   between states following fire among four canopy-cover (structural)
   classes: non-forest (0\% tree cover), sparse woodland (< 10\% tree
   cover), open forest (10-40\% tree cover), and closed forest (> 40\% tree
   cover). We also evaluated changes in the size structure and composition
   of live overstory trees (>= 1.4 m height) due to mortality following
   fire. The severity and resulting effects of fire varied among structural
   classes: Non-forest was less likely to burn than the landscape as a
   whole; open forest was more likely to remain forest than to change to
   non-forest; and closed forest never changed to non-forest, irrespective
   of burn severity. Higher-severity fires caused greater mortality of
   larger-diameter trees than of smaller-diameter trees. Our results
   suggest that structural components of the alpine treeline will not
   respond unidirectionally to a warming climate nor to an increase in
   fire. Instead, the ecotone will expand bidirectionally and develop
   larger, more heterogeneous patches of vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{During the Bukavu Conference on flora and fauna conservation (26-31
   October 1953), a French delegation submitted a recommendation, which was
   unanimously adopted, calling for an overall policy for nature protection
   in Africa. The 1933 London Convention, which only addressed the
   ``conservation of fauna and flora in their natural state{''}, no longer
   seems adequate: the conservation of a few animal or plant species and
   the creation of national parks and nature reserves only address
   particular areas of nature conservation, which need to be extended to
   protect the whole environment in which African people live. This
   includes spontaneous vegetation, which protects water and soils and
   forms not only forests but also indeterminate ``bush{''}. A specific
   convention for Africa is justified because nature in Africa is different
   and more seriously endangered than elsewhere. It is in danger because of
   the extreme climate, but also from bush fires and slash-and-burn
   agriculture that cannot sustain the undernourished population. Savannah
   encroachment, soil erosion and impoverishment and desertification are
   gaining ground. A common policy for all African territories has become
   essential to ensure their protection, and also to fight epidemics.
   Africa's nature forms a whole that has no boundaries, but natural
   regions that interact climatically. Over and above a Charter for nature
   protection in Africa, the issue is that of protecting Africa's
   populations, but without subjecting them to scientific planning that
   disregards their customary practices.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian vegetation plays an integral role in the ecology of the streams
   it borders, and in many western US forests, is subjected to frequent
   wildfire disturbances. Many questions concerning the role of natural
   fire in the dynamics of riparian zone vegetation remain unanswered. This
   case study explores the relationships between wildfire burn patterns,
   stream channel topography, and the short-term response of riparian
   vegetation to fire along two creeks in the northern Sierra Nevada
   mixed-conifer forest. Post-fire sampling along 60, 3 m wide transects
   across riparian zones was used to document the topography, species
   distribution, sprouting response, and seedling recruitment I year after
   the Lookout fire in the Plumas National Forest, CA. Our results indicate
   that larger riparian zones acted as natural fire breaks, limiting the
   progression of the predominantly backing fire downhill toward the
   stream. On Fourth Water creek's steeper first terraces, where crown
   fires occurred, the percentage of burned plants that sprouted was higher
   than in the less-severely burned and more extensive first terraces of
   Third Water creek (93\% versus 33\%, P < 0.05). Total seedling
   recruitment was higher along Fourth Water creek (69 versus 35 seedlings,
   P < 0.05), while plant regeneration along Third Water creek was
   primarily vegetative. Along Fourth Water creek, the percent of burned
   hardwoods that sprouted increased with proximity to the water's edge
   from 33\% on the slope above the riparian zone to 95\% on the gravel
   bar, suggesting that moisture content plays a role in riparian species
   response to fire. An influx of white fir (Abies concolor Gordon \&
   Glend. (Lindl.)) seedlings on the second terraces of Third Water creek
   may indicate a shift in species composition if future fires are
   suppressed and regeneration trends do not change significantly in the
   next few years. These results contribute to the limited research on
   natural fire in riparian zones, and can inform management strategies

Abstract = {{Direct and indirect human impacts may be causing widespread vegetation
   changes African tropical dry forests (TDFs). This study provides the
   first field-based large-scale assessment of vegetation changes for the
   miombo region, using nation-wide re-measured permanent plots for the
   Republic of Zambia. Using path analysis, a technique used to describe
   and quantify causal relationships, we investigated the drivers of change
   for the 2006-2014 period, under different land-use and productivity
   trajectories. We assessed the change in vegetation metrics representing
   stand structure and tree diversity, identified causal factors for
   species richness, basal area, and productivity and compared the biomass
   change of different species. We assessed carbon emissions and
   absorptions from forestlands and used error propagation and sensitivity
   analysis to quantify uncertainty. Our results suggest that Zambia's TDFs
   are resilient in the face of human activities, with significant biomass
   gains observed in the re-measured plots over the country. However, the
   proximity to roads, fragmentation by other land uses, and to a lesser
   extent fire occurrence were found to negatively affect productivity. We
   found that biomass gains were concentrated in several dominant species,
   mostly belonging to a single subfamily of non-nodulating legumes
   (Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae) characteristic of the region. Our
   results indicate that Zambia's TDFs have been acting as an overall
   carbon sink, despite large carbon emissions from land-cover change.
   Decline in biomass for certain dominant species signal a risk of
   over-exploitation. Wealso identified important differences in plant
   diversity and functional traits between miombo woodlands and other types
   of African savanna vegetation, signaling differences in ecological
   processes at play. These results illustrate the ecological complexity
   and diversity of Africa's vegetation, and caution against over
   generalizations of ecological processes in the context of global change
   and carbon management. Future research should focus on understanding the

Abstract = {{Although fires are common disturbances in North American forests, the
   extent to which soil invertebrate assemblages recover from burning
   remains unclear. Here, we examine long-term (14- to 101-yr) recoveries
   of soil invertebrate communities from common cut and burn treatments
   conducted at 6 to 26-yr intervals since 1911 in a deciduous forest in
   the upper Great Lakes region (USA). We characterize soil surface
   macro-invertebrate communities during both fall and spring across a
   long-term, experimental fire chronosequence to characterize invertebrate
   community recovery at decadal time-scales and community changes between
   seasons. We posited that changes in invertebrate community structure
   might, in turn, impact decomposition process. We sampled active
   organisms at the soil surface using pitfall traps. We described
   understory vegetation, measured soil properties, and conducted a 4-year
   litter bag study with big-toothed aspen leaves (Populus grandidentata).
   Invertebrate community responses followed a habitat accommodation model
   of succession showing that invertebrate succession is dependent on the
   soil surface properties. The fall and spring measures revealed that the
   densities of active invertebrates were highest 101 years after fire. For
   a given pair of stands, a pattern of sharing higher percentage of taxa
   was denoted when stands were of similar age. Some species such as the
   beetle Stelidota octomaculata appeared to be indicator of the
   chronosequence succession stage because it tracks the successional
   increase of Quercus and acorn production at the study site. We also
   found a significant positive correlation between leaf decomposition of
   soil macrofaunal accessible leaves and millipedes density across the
   chronosequence. We show that vegetation cover changes and related shifts
   in habitat structure occurring during post-fire succession are important
   in shaping communities assemblages. This finding highlights the
   importance of simultaneously considering abiotic-biotic factors together
   with above- and belowground measurements to better characterize controls
   on successional community dynamics after disturbance. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multiparasitism is a common ecological phenomenon, being the norm rather
   than the exception, in the wild. This article describes the case of a
   wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, originating from a post-fire
   regeneration area, infected with multiple helminth species and
   remarkable overweight. The mouse analyzed was captured at a post-fire
   regeneration site in the Serra Calderona Natural Park (Comunitat
   Valenciana, Spain). The rodent was captured and marked for the first
   time in the spring of 2011, weighing 22.5 g. When it was recaptured in
   the winter of 2012, it weighed 44.0 g. The mouse was parasitized by a
   total of 31 helminths belonging to seven species, including six Taenia
   parva metacestodes. These tapeworm juveniles reached a weight of 12.0 g,
   more than 25 \% of the host's weight. Therefore, multiple parasitism
   should be considered the real cause of its elevated weight. Although
   only one case of this unusual overweight has been found in this
   post-fire regeneration area, it, nevertheless, supports the theory that
   ecosystem instability can induce unusual situations in the parasite-host
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Sediments were collected from four slow vegetation recovery plots, six
   fast vegetation recovery plots and five unburned plots at a post-fire
   site on a rainfall event basis and sorted for size distribution. The aim
   was to evaluate the effects of vegetation cover, soil aggregate
   stability, slope and rainfall intensity on sediment size distribution,
   transport selectivity and erosion processes between the burned and
   unburned treatment plots. Sediment detachment and transport mechanisms
   and the particle size transport selectivity of the eroded sediment were
   assessed based on enrichment ratios (ER) and mean weighted diameter
   (MWD) methods. The most eroded particle size class in all treatment
   plots was the 125-250 mu m class and, generally, the percentage of
   eroded particle sizes did not increase with slope and rainfall
   intensity. Higher MWD of the eroded sediment was related to a higher
   percentage of bare soil exposed and gravel content associated with high
   soil burn severity and soil disaggregation in the slow vegetation
   recovery plots. The enrichment of finer clay silt particle sizes
   increased with varying maximum 30-min rainfall intensity (I-30) in the
   slow vegetation recovery plots, and reflected increased aggregate
   breakdown and transport selectivity, whereas no good relationship was
   found in the fast vegetation recovery and unburned plots with varying
   I-30. A minimum I-30 of <3.56 mm h(-1) and a maximum of 10.9 mm h(-1)
   were found to be the threshold rainfall intensity values necessary for
   aggregate breakdown and transport of finer particles by both rainsplash
   and rainflow in the slow vegetation recovery plots, whereas the response
   was weak in the fast vegetation recovery and unburned plots following
   varying I-30 dominated only by rainsplash transport closer to the plot
   sediment collector. The results show that higher vegetation cover in the
   fast vegetation recovery and unburned plots reduces erosive rainfall
   energy by 5.6- and 17.7-fold respectively, and runoff energy by 6.3- and
   21.3-fold respectively, limiting aggregate breakdown and transport
   selectivity of finer particles compared with the slow vegetation

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{14-26}},
Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is commonly used for restoration, but the effects of
   reintroducing fire following a century of fire exclusion are unknown in
   many ecosystems. We assessed the effects of three prescribed fires,
   native ungulate browsing, and conifer competition on quaking aspen
   (Populus tremuloides Michx.) regeneration in four small groves (0.5 ha
   to 3.0 ha) in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, USA, over an 11
   yr period. The effects of fire on aspen regeneration density and height
   were variable within and among sites. Post-fire aspen regeneration
   density generally decreased with greater conifer basal area (r(s) =
   -0.73), but there was a wide range of aspen regeneration densities (4000
   to 36 667 stems ha(-1)) at transects with no live conifers post-fire.
   The height of aspen regeneration increased as a function of increasing
   years-since-fire (1 yr to 11 yr), but heavy browsing by mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus Rafinesque) may alter future growth trajectories.
   Median percent of aspen regeneration browsed was high in burned (91 \%)
   and unburned (81 \%) transects. Only 7 \% (282 stems ha(-1) to 333 stems
   ha-1) of post-fire aspen regeneration in 11-year old burns exceeded the
   height necessary to escape mule deer browsing (150 cm). Browsing may
   also be altering aspen growth form, such that multi-stemmed aspen
   regeneration was positively associated with proportion of aspen
   regeneration browsed. These four case studies indicate that the effects
   of prescribed fires on quaking aspen in the southern Cascade Range of
   northern California were highly variable and, when coupled with biotic
   factors (such as deer browsing and competing vegetation) and varying
   fire severity, fire may either benefit or hasten the decline of small
   aspen groves.}},

Abstract = {{Question Fire and flood act as ecological filters on vegetation, either
   separately or combined, and cause morphological and physiological
   changes. Hence, they influence the composition and structure of plant
   communities. Since evidence strongly suggests that they are important
   filters operating in the system, we asked if fire, flood intensity, and
   their interaction could be related to variation in the functional traits
   of studied trees. Study Site Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
   Methods We sampled 14 individuals (totaling 280) of the 20 most
   representative trees in 24 forest patches along the flooding gradient
   and measured functional traits related to allocation of resources and
   protection in response to these filters. We also assessed leaf and soil
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels. Results Along the flooding
   gradient, the studied tree species showed a tendency toward decreasing
   specific leaf area (SLA), as well as leaf nitrogen concentrations,
   whereas leaf thickness and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) increased. In
   burned areas, LDMC and leaf nitrogen exhibited the opposite tendency and
   decreased along the flooding gradient. Leaf thickness (LT) showed less
   increase in burned areas, while SLA had less decrease. Relative Bark
   Thickness (RBT) increased along the flooding gradient only after fire.
   Soil nitrogen decreased along the flooding gradient without an effect of
   fire. Conclusions Since LDMC is a proxy of flammability, the probability
   of burning decreases after each fire event, while the most flooded
   environments become less fire-prone. In burned environments, the
   differences in the allocation of resources (SLA and LT) diminish along
   the flooding gradient, indicating that leaf behavior is almost the same
   post-fire. RBT increases with increased flooding only after a fire,
   contributing to oxygen exchange during floods to protect the bark
   against fire. The interaction between fire and flood causes tree species
   to invest in structures for protection and resistance to fire, as well
   as retain nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{We describe satellite-inferred burn severity patterns of areas that were
   burned and then reburned by wildland fire from 1984 to 2004 within the
   Gila Aldo Leopold Wilderness Complex, New Mexico, USA. Thirteen fires
   have burned 27 000 hectares across multiple vegetation types at
   intervals between fires ranging from 3 yr to 14 yr. Burn severity of
   reburned areas showed sensitivity to the severity of the initial fire.
   The severity of reburned areas also varied by vegetation type and time
   elapsed between fires. Initial fires that burned at low severity tended
   to reburn at low severity, while reburned areas where initial fire was
   severe showed higher probability of reburning at high severity. Our
   analysis also suggests that there may be thresholds in the severity of
   an initial burn above which the severity of the subsequent fire is
   likely to increase. Because the spectral index used primarily reflects
   changes in vegetation relative to pre-burn conditions, a large relative
   change in post-fire vegetation (e. g., shrubs and small trees), as
   inferred from remotely sensed spectral data, is likely at sites that
   previously burned at high severity. Field data are needed to fully
   assess the reburn severity issue, in order to demonstrate that severe
   reburns may be a relatively new phenomenon occurring outside the
   historical norm, with potential long-term ecological significance.}},

   brushwood and woodland) at the same time (toposequence), and the other
   collected twice from the same place at the interval of seven years
   (chronosequence). I stated that the appearance of even a small number of
   ornitochorous seeds and their seedlings can be treated as a signal that
   the bush encroachment will accelerate. Seed number seems to decrease
   during succession in the analysed sequence of plant communities. The
   total number of species in the seed bank did not change in the most
   dynamic plant communities: grassland and brushwood, and it was
   significantly higher there than in the seed bank of woodland. During the

Abstract = {{Post-settlement changes in vegetation and land use were examined in a
   reputedly undisturbed woodland remnant at Ocean Grove, southern
   Victoria, the site of earlier ecological studies. The vegetation has
   passed through at least three structural phases since European
   colonisation: an open grassy woodland dominated by Allocasuarina and
   Eucalyptus species and Banksia marginata Cav. with few shrubs; an open
   scrub of Acacia pycnantha Benth.; and a closed scrub of Allocasuarina
   littoralis (Salisb.) L.A.S.Johnson, which now dominates the reserve.
   Tree and shrub density has progressively increased, from perhaps less
   than 20 trees ha(-1) in the early 1800s, to over 3000 trees ha(-1) in
   1996. Most large Allocasuarina trees established in the late 1930s or
   early 1940s, and Allocasuarina littoralis appears to have invaded
   rapidly thereafter. Surprisingly, A. littoralis was not recorded in an
   1894 plant census, and might have been locally rare last century.
   Vegetation changes over the past 200 years can be attributed to the
   long-term absence of fire. The abundant recruitment of Acacia species in
   the mid- to late-1800s may have been a rapid response to the curtailment
   of Aboriginal burning, and the more recent invasion of A. littoralis a
   longer-term response to fire exclusion. The importance of active
   vegetation management for biodiversity conservation in the future is

Abstract = {{We studied vegetation change of a remnant barrens in southern Illinois
   over twenty-five years. The study area was periodically burned between
   1969 and 1993, but fire was excluded for a 16-year period (1974-1989).
   During the study, the barrens supported a mixture of species whose
   preferred habitats ranged from prairie and open woodlands to closed
   forest communities. The herbaceous vegetation may be on a trajectory
   characterized by increasing dominance of woodland species and declining
   prairie species. Fire management temporarily reversed this trend, but it
   continued once::fire was excluded. Reintroduction of prescribed burning
   in 1990-1993 altered the vegetation trajectory but not back toward a
   species composition comparable to that present on the site before
   cessation of fire management after 1973. Following interruption of
   prescribed burning, tree basal area more than doubled, and density
   showed a 67\% increase between premanagement conditions in 1968 and
   1988. Salix humilis (prairie willow) density had significant negative
   correlations with tree density and basal area. However, there was no

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{1. The influence of fire upon biodiversity has been investigated in many
   ecosystems under a wide range of environmental conditions. However,
   there is no information on how fire affects faunal biodiversity in
   deciduous forest ecosystems prone to winter fires, such as those on the
   southern slopes of the Alps.
   2. The main aim of this study was to analyse the effects of single and
   repeated fires on the structure and species diversity of spider
   communities in chestnut forests in southern Switzerland. A second
   objective was to interpret the ecological response of forest-floor
   habitats to wildfires, using epigeic spiders as bioindicators.
   3. One-hundred and thirty-three spider species were found in pitfall
   trap samples collected between April and September in burnt and control
   sites in chestnut coppices. Species richness and community composition
   were influenced by fire frequency and the time elapsed since the last
   fire. About 19\% of the species were trapped exclusively in sites that
   had been repeatedly burnt, while 11\% occurred only in unburnt coppice.
   Post-fire development of the spider community was chiefly from
   individuals that survived in situ. We found no characteristic pioneer
   species in any of the burnt sites. There were indirect effects of fire
   on the spider community, through interactions between species arising
   from the changing environmental conditions following a fire.
   4. After a single fire, changes in community composition were only
   observable during the first 2 years. At sites that had experienced
   repeated fires, there was a more persistent influence on community
   composition. These sites were characterized by an increase in species
   richness and species diversity. The presence of a wide ecological range
   of species in `repeated fire' sites was probably due to the mosaic
   structure of the environment and the wide range of microclimate
   conditions at the soil surface, with a predominance of xeric conditions.
   5. The spider communities of chestnut forests were resilient to
   disturbance by fire. Both the formerly intensive management of these
   forests (until the 1950s) and a history of frequent fires that goes back
   to the Neolithic period have played an important part in the development
   of the spider community in these forests.}},

Abstract = {{Miombo woodlands are the largest savanna in the world and dominate
   southern Africa. They are strongly influenced by anthropogenic fires and
   support the livelihoods of over 100 million people. Managing the fire
   regime of these flammable systems is difficult, but crucial for
   sustaining biodiversity, ecosystem services, and carbon stocks. Fire
   intensity is more easily manipulated than fire frequency, because
   suppression is expensive and ineffective. However, there are important
   issues relating fire intensity to impacts on woody vegetation that need
   to be understood to inform management approaches. Such impacts include
   the links between fire intensity, tree top-kill, resprouting, and
   regrowth rates. Here we present results from a fire experiment in
   Mozambican miombo; the results of a 50-year fire experiment in
   Zimbabwean miombo; and observations of forest structure at a dry-forest
   site in Mozambique. We synthesize these data with a process-based gap
   model of stem growth, regeneration, and mortality; this model explicitly
   considers the effect of different frequencies and intensities of fire.
   We use the model, tested against the field data, to explore the
   sensitivity of woodland tree populations and biomass to fire intensity
   and frequency.
   The fire experiments show that large (>5 cm dbh) stems are vulnerable to
   fire, with top-kill rates of up to 12\% in intense fires. In contrast to
   idealized physical representations of tree mortality, stems of >10 cm
   dbh did not gain further protection from fire with increasing dbh.
   Resprouting was very common and not obviously linked to fire intensity.
   The modeling showed that miombo tree populations and biomass are very
   sensitive to fire intensity, offering opportunities for effective
   management. At any achievable fire return interval (<5 years),
   low-intensity fires are required to maintain observed biomass. Model
   predictions and field experiments show that no tree biomass can be
   sustained under annual fires.}},

   times 1 yr after the fire. Unexpectedly, the elevated dust fluxes did
   not decrease during the second and third years in burned areas,
   apparently because ongoing drought delayed post-fire recovery. Our
   estimates enable assessment of amplification in contaminant-related
   risks following a major type of disturbance-wildfire, which is expected
   to increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change. More
   generally, our results highlight the importance of considering wind- as
   well as water-driven transport and erosion, particularly following
   disturbance, for ecosystem biogeochemistry in general and human and

Abstract = {{During natural and prescribed fires, combustion of heavy surface fuel
   loads can expose underlying soil to high temperatures causing thermal
   alteration of soil minerals and other changes in soil properties. We
   studied the effect of fire on soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) by
   comparing severely burned soils to nearby unburned soils at five forest
   and woodland sites in California, USA. Combusted logs and heavy fuel
   produced reddened zones of thermally altered soil underlain by blackened
   zones where heat exposure was lower. The cation exchange capacities of
   the reddened soils were 57 to 82\% lower than the unburned soil while
   the blackened soils had 31 to 53\% less CEC than unburned soil. The
   reddened soil experienced the highest burning temperatures resulting in
   the loss of organic carbon (OC), the conversion of goethite to maghemite
   or hematite, the destruction of kaolin, and dehydroxylation and
   permanent collapse of vermiculite and chlorite. Overall, most of the CEC
   loss was due to thermal destruction of soil organic matter (SOM), but
   this CEC will be restored in the post-fire ecosystem succession as
   biomass re-accumulates and rebuilds soil humus. The loss of CEC due to
   mineral alteration is longer lasting, though limited in spatial extent.

Abstract = {{Habitat modification by fire and habitat loss via anthropogenic
   vegetation clearance and fragmentation both impact animal populations.
   Yet, there has been limited investigation as to whether animals that
   decline under one of these types of habitat change also decline under
   the other, and how their cumulative impacts affect the status of species
   and communities. Using a similar to 400-year chronosequence in the
   world's largest extant temperate woodland in south-western Australia, we
   examine how time since fire affects bird community richness, reporting
   rates and composition, and whether taxa grouped on the basis of
   responses to vegetation clearance and fragmentation in an adjoining
   agricultural landscape are associated with either recently-burnt or
   long-unbumt woodlands. Consistent with substantial changes in vegetation
   composition and structure after fire in obligate-seeder eucalypt
   woodlands, woodland bird communities were strongly affected by fire.
   Species richness and total reporting rates increased with time since
   fire, and community composition changed across the entire multi-century
   span of the chronosequence. Woodland birds most negatively impacted by
   vegetation clearance and fragmentation were strongly associated with
   long-unburnt woodlands. in a regional south-western Australian context,
   where extensive vegetation clearance has substantially reduced the range
   and populations of many woodland bird species, the ability of remaining
   unfragmented woodlands to support populations of these species will be
   strongly contingent on appropriate fire management. Specifically, as
   stand-replacement fires have affected 25-30\% of extant woodland over
   recent decades, management to limit the extent of fire in remaining
   long-unburnt woodlands would appear a priority for conservation of
   woodland bird diversity.}},

   centuries, and fires fueled by native vegetation are undocumented in the
   southwestern deserts. We estimated the area damaged by fire using
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index, which are more accurate and reduce subjectivity of
   aerial surveys of perimeters of fires. Assemblages of upland and
   xeroriparian plants lost 91 and 81\% of live cover, respectively, in
   fires. The trees Olneya tesota and Cercidium had high amounts of
   top-kill. King Valley was an important xeroriparian corridor for birds.
   Species richness of birds decreased significantly following the fire.
   Numbers of breeding birds were lower in burned areas of King Valley 3
   years post-fire, compared to numbers in nearby but unburned Alamo Wash.
   Although birds function within a large geographic scale, the extent of
   this burn still influenced the relative abundance of local species of

   of localized burns and slow recovery of vegetation contributes to
   continued lower numbers of birds in the burned sites in King Valley.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires naturally occur worldwide, however the potential disruption to
   ecosystem services from subsequent post-fire flooding and erosion often
   necessitates a response from land managers. The impact of high severity
   wildfire on infiltration and interrill erosion responses was evaluated
   for five years after the 2003 Hot Creek Fire in Idaho, USA. Relative
   infiltration from mini-disk tension infiltrometers (MIDI) was compared
   to rainfall simulation measurements on small burned and control plots.
   Vegetation recovery was slow due to the severity of the fire, with
   median cover of 6-8\% on burned sites after 5 years. Consequently,
   interrill sediment yields remained significantly higher on the burned
   sites (329-1200 g m(-2)) compared to the unburned sites (3-35 g m(-2))
   in year 5. Total infiltration on the burned plots increased during the
   study period, yet were persistently lower compared to the control plots.
   Relative infiltration measurements made at the soil surface, and 1- and
   3-cm depths were significantly correlated to non-steady state total
   infiltration values taken in the first 10 minutes of the hour-long
   rainfall simulations. Significant correlations were found at the 1-cm (p
   = 0.4-0.6) and 3-cm (p = 0.3-0.6) depths (most p-values <0.001), and
   somewhat weaker correlations at the soil surface (p = 0.2-0.4) (p-values
   <0.05 and up). Soil water repellency is often stronger below the soil
   surface after severe wildfire, and likely contributes to the reduced
   infiltration. These results suggest that relative infiltration
   measurements at shallow depths may be useful to estimate potential
   infiltration during a short-duration high-intensity storm and could be
   used as an input for post-fire erosion models.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial and satellite imagery are widely used to assess the severity and

   field assessment. We assessed the accuracy of classifying color-infrared
   imagery in combination with post-fire LiDAR, and with differenced (pre-
   and post-fire) LiDAR, in estimating plot percent mortality in a
   second-growth coast redwood forest near Santa Cruz, CA. Percent
   mortality of trees greater than 25.4 cm DBH in 47 permanent 0.08 ha

   from National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) was 74\% accurate; the
   model using NDVI and post-fire LiDAR was 85\% accurate, while the model
   using NDVI and differenced LiDAR was 83\% accurate. The addition of
   post-fire LiDAR data provided a modest increase in accuracy compared to

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{We have designed a pyrocosm to enable fine-scale dissection of post-fire
   soil microbial communities. Using it we show that the peak soil
   temperature achieved at a given depth occurs hours after the fire is
   out, lingers near this peak for a significant time, and is accurately
   predicted by soil depth and the mass of charcoal burned. Flash fuels
   that produce no large coals were found to have a negligible soil heating
   effect. Coupling this system with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the
   control and post-fire soil we show that we can stimulate a rapid,
   massive response by Pyronema, a well-known genus of pyrophilous fungus,
   within two weeks of a test fire. This specific stimulation occurs in a
   background of many other fungal taxa that do not change noticeably with
   the fire, although there is an overall reduction in richness and
   evenness. We introduce a thermo-chemical gradient model to summarize the
   way that heat, soil depth and altered soil chemistry interact to create
   a predictable, depthstructured habitat for microbes in post-fire soils.
   Coupling this model with the temperature relationships found in the
   pyrocosms, we predict that the width of a survivable ``goldilocks
   zone{''}, which achieves temperatures that select for postfire-adapted
   microbes, will stay relatively constant across a range of fuel loads. In
   addition we predict that a larger necromass zone, containing labile
   carbon and nutrients from recently heat-killed organisms, will increase
   in size rapidly with addition of fuel and then remain nearly constant in
   size over a broad range of fuel loads. The simplicity of this
   experimental system, coupled with the availability of a set of
   sequenced, assembled and annotated genomes of pyrophilous fungi, offers
   a powerful tool for dissecting the ecology of post-fire microbial
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{In permafrost regions, forest fires actively affect physical and
   chemical properties of soils. Many studies have been conducted on the
   effects of forest fires on physical and chemical properties of topsoil,
   while the research on the fire-induced changes in carbon and other
   nutrients of soils has received much less attention, particularly that
   of soils in the active layer and near-surface permafrost. Here, using
   soil samples from two representative areas (Mangui and Alongshan), we
   investigated the effects of fires on soil nutrients of larch forest
   soils in the discontinuous permafrost zone in the northern Da
   Xing'anling (Hinggan) Mountains, Northeast China. The results showed
   that soil pH increased with fire severity due to the burning of soil
   organic matter by more severe fires and leaching of base elements in the
   residual ash into the soil, and; forest fires resulted in a weakly
   acidic post-fire soil environment. Soil total organic carbon, total
   nitrogen, and total phosphorus declined with increasing fire severity. A
   severe burn led to a substantial reduction of soil carbon and nitrogen,
   which were not recovered seven years after fire. However, there was no
   substantial change in the C/N ratio. For the two chosen areas, soil C/N
   ratios decreased with depth. In the first post-fire year, total
   potassium content increased and were similar at the sites affected by
   fires of different severity in the area burned seven years ago. There
   was no significant change in available phosphorus and available
   potassium. These changes were notable in the active layer and/or organic
   layers, but not so in the near-surface permafrost layer. Our results
   suggest that, in permafrost regions, forest fires have important effects
   on the distribution of soil carbon and other nutrients. This study on
   the feedback mechanisms between forest fires and nutrients in
   discontinuous permafrost regions in the northern Da Xing'anling
   Mountains is of importance for understanding the boreal carbon pool and

Abstract = {{Ailanthus altissima ((Mill.) Swingle, tree-of-heaven, Chinese sumac,
   stink tree) is a nonnative invasive tree that is common throughout much
   of the eastern United States. It can invade and expand dramatically when
   forests are disturbed. Anecdotal evidence suggests that fire might
   facilitate its spread, but the relationship between fire and this
   prolific invasive tree is poorly understood. To better understand the
   impacts of fire on Ailanthus, we conducted a study at Tar Hollow State
   Forest in southeastern Ohio, USA where Ailanthus is widely distributed.
   Our objective was to quantify the direct effects of prescribed fire on
   the demography of Ailanthus populations, with and without the pre-burn
   application of the stem-injected herbicide, imazapyr. We quantified
   demographic attributes (survival, density, and sprouting) of Ailanthus
   germinants, seedlings, saplings, and trees in a field experiment with
   four treatment combinations: (1) no fire and no herbicide, (2)
   herbicide, (3) fire, and (4) herbicide plus fire. Ailanthus stems > 3 cm
   dbh were stem-injected with the herbicide, imazapyr in late summer to
   early fall followed by prescribed fire in April. We determined that
   herbicide plus prescribed bum treatment was highly effective in killing
   large saplings and trees, with no resprouting evident after four growing
   seasons. In the season immediately after the burn with and without
   herbicide treatment, small Ailanthus sapling and seedling abundance
   increased, but did not persist. Over time, Ailanthus germinants and
   sprouts from top-killed stems were poor competitors with faster-growing
   post-fire woody regeneration as forest floor shading increased. In
   addition, the late growing season application of imazapyr was highly
   effective in killing Ailanthus and subsequent sprouts. This study, the
   first to quantify the direct effects of fire on Ailanthus, demonstrates
   that prescribed fire alone does not appear to facilitate the spread of
   Ailanthus.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires can greatly increase runoff and surface erosion rates.
   Post-fire soil erosion control measures are intended to minimize this
   response and facilitate ecosystem recovery. In a few recent cases,
   hydromulch has been applied, and this consists of a mixture of organic
   fibers, water and seeds. The objectives of this research were to (i)
   analyze the effectiveness of hydromulch in reducing post-fire runoff and
   sediment production and (ii) determine the underlying processes and
   mechanisms that control post-fire runoff and erosion. After a wildfire
   occurred in August 2008, 14 plots ranging in size from 0.25 to 10 m(2)
   were installed on a 25 degree slope in a burnt pine plantation that had
   also been subjected to salvage logging. Half of the plots were randomly
   selected and treated with hydromulch. One of two slope strips adjacent
   to the plots was also hydromulched and used for monitoring some soil
   properties. Measurements made in each of the first 3 years following the
   wildfire included (i) the plot-scale runoff volumes and sediment yields;
   (ii) soil shear strength, soil moisture, and soil water repellency; and
   (iii) surface cover. The hydromulch reduced overland flow volume by 70\%
   and soil erosion by 83\%. The decrease in runoff was attributed to the
   increase in soil water retention capacity and the decrease in soil water
   repellency, whereas the reduction in soil erosion was initially
   attributed to the protective cover provided by the hydromulch and lately
   to an enhanced vegetative regrowth in the third year after burning.

Abstract = {{Wildfires have increased in frequency and intensity worldwide with

   Here we show that brown antechinus, a small insectivorous marsupial
   mammal, (i) endured a prescribed fire in situ, (ii) remained in their
   scorched home range despite unburned areas nearby, and (iii)
   substantially increased post-fire torpor use and thus reduced foraging

   adaptation that, although not quantified in this context previously,
   appears to play a key role in post-fire survival for this and other

Abstract = {{Fire is the most important disturbance factor in Cypress (Austrocedrus
   chilensis) forests in Patagonia, Argentina. This ecosystem recovers
   poorly after fire, and direct sowing could be a potentially useful
   restoration practice. To evaluate the effect of season of sowing,
   post-fire plant cover (PC), and climatic variability on seedling
   emergence and survival, three direct sowing studies were established in
   two burned cypress stands: Trevelin (xeric conditions) and El Bolson
   (mesic conditions). Two studies were conducted in winter (2000 and 2001)
   and one in spring (2001). Precipitation was higher than the mean during
   the 20002001 growing season and lower during 20012002. At both sites,
   emergence and survival were much higher for winter- than for spring-sown
   seedlings. In the xeric stand, emergence and survival of winter-sown
   seedlings increased with medium and high PC values, after the humid and
   dry summers, respectively. However, most spring-sown seedlings did not
   emerge, and those that did were short-lived. Because of the more
   favorable growing conditions in the mesic stand, PC had no effect on
   emergence and only favored first year survival of winter-sown seedlings
   after the dry summer. Spring-sown seedlings showed no association with
   PC in the mesic site, probably because the first summer was
   exceptionally humid. We speculate that shading plants exert a positive
   effect on cypress seedling establishment, likely by reducing the stress
   from high temperatures and low water availability. Sowing of small
   patches under the protection of understory vegetation could be useful in
   restoring burned cypress stands.}},

Abstract = {{Potential impacts of soil temperatures in a post-fire environment were
   examined for seeds of legume species with a physical seed dormancy
   typically found in the eucalypt communities in eastern Australia. Soil
   temperatures in a post-fire environment may be elevated owing to
   increased solar radiation and this may influence germination of species
   with soil-stored seed banks. Seeds were heated at 50, 60 or 70 degrees
   C, with one unheated control, for 3 h per day for 5 days to simulate
   soil temperatures where canopy gaps existed. More germination of
   small-seeded species (<12.6 mg) occurred owing to changes in simulated
   soil temperatures than large-seeded species (>14.0 mg). Temperatures up
   to 70 degrees C significantly increased the germination of species with
   relatively small-sized seeds than large-seeded species (>70 degrees C).
   This study demonstrated that small-seeded species are able to germinate
   across a range of temperatures (50-70 degrees C) and can have dormancy
   broken either during the passage of a fire, or after fire from increased
   solar radiation, potentially resulting in the decline of the post-fire

Abstract = {{Conservation of biodiversity in fire-prone regions depends on

   (i) determine the ability of commonly used shorter-term (2years) surveys
   to detect reptile responses to time since fire (TSF) and (ii)
   investigate whether ecological traits of species reliably predicted
   their responses to fire. Of 16 reptile species analysed, four had
   responses to TSF consistent with shorter-term surveys and three showed
   no response to TSF. Nine species had responses to TSF not detected in
   previous studies using smaller but substantial subsets of the same data.
   Among the 13 affected species, times of peak abundance ranged from 1 to
   50years after fire. Nocturnal, burrowing species tended to be early
   successional and leaf-litter dwellers to be late successional, but these

Abstract = {{Wildfires have been increasing in size and severity over recent decades.
   Forest managers use fuel treatments, including tree thinning and
   prescribed burning, to reduce the risk of high-severity fire. The impact
   of fuel treatments on carbon dynamics is not fully understood; previous
   research indicates that because carbon is removed during fuel
   treatments, the net effect may not be a reduction of carbon lost in the
   case of wildfire. The Rodeo-Chediski Fire, which burned in Arizona in
   2002, was one of the largest and most severe wildfires recorded in the
   southwestern United States. Our objectives were to quantify carbon in
   three pools (live overstory trees, standing snags, and forest floor
   debris) across a combination of burn seventies and pre-fire treatments,
   2 years and 8 years after the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. Treatments included
   prescribed (Rx) fire, a cut and burn treatment, and no treatment. We
   sampled 106 plots in 36 sites in our ponderosa pine-dominated study
   area. We found that treatments strongly influenced fire severity; high-
   and moderate-severity fire was reduced from 76\% in untreated areas to
   57\% in Rx fire treatments and 38\% in cut and burn treatments. Fire
   severity, year, and severity X year were significant factors affecting
   carbon in the three different pools across the landscape. Eight years
   post-fire, high-severity burned areas had only 58\% of the total carbon
   (live + dead) that low-severity areas had, and only 3\% of the live
   carbon. Live carbon increased over time in low-severity sites but
   decreased over time in high-severity sites. We conclude that fuel
   treatments can significantly influence fire severity, which in turn
   influences carbon pools. However, treatments may or may not reduce
   overall carbon loss from an ecosystem in the event of a wildfire given
   that treatments remove carbon too. Finally, long-term monitoring is
   important to gain a more complete understanding of post-fire carbon
   dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Abstract = {{Because wildfires alter plant communities, we describe the effects of a
   single fire event on the composition and diversity of Amazonian
   ferruginous savannas, locally known ascangas. We installed 20
   observation plots in burned and unburned parts of a homogeneouscangasite

   composition slightly, increased functional richness and the abundance of
   anemochoric and subshrub species, but did not influence the number of
   phanerophyte species, highlighting the importance of both seeding and
   resprouting strategies in the post-fire scenario. In contrast, neither
   taxonomic nor phylogenetic diversity was affected by the fire event. The
   absence of differences in the phylogenetic community structure indicated
   that specific adaptations to fires are widespread within
   thecangaphylogeny, although fires are not an eminent part of these
   ecosystems, as in other neotropical savannas. As diversity metrics were
   not negatively affected by a single fire event and only small shifts in
   species composition were observed, our data indicate maintenance of
   important ecosystem properties despite an occasional wildfire event in

Abstract = {{British Columbia experienced three years with notably large and severe
   wildfires since 2015. Multiple stand-replacing wildfires occurred in
   coastal-transitional forests, where large fires are typically rare, and
   thus, information on post-fire carbon is lacking. Because of their
   carbon storage potential, coastal-transitional forests are important in
   the global carbon cycle. We examined differences in surface fuel carbon
   among fire severity classes in 2016, one year after the Boulder Creek
   fire, which burned 6 735 ha of coastal-transitional forests in 2015.
   Using remotely sensed indices (dNBR), we partitioned the fire area into
   unburned (control), low-, moderate-, and high-severity classes. Field
   plots were randomly located in each class. At each plot, surface fuel
   carbon was quantified by type, namely coarse, small, and fine woody
   material, duff, and litter, and carbon mass by fuel type was compared
   among severity classes. Total surface fuel carbon did not differ
   significantly between burned and unburned plots; however, there was
   significantly less duff and litter carbon in burned plots. Remotely
   sensed severity classes did not properly capture wildfire impacts on
   surface fuels, especially at lower severities. Pre-fire stand
   characteristics are also important drivers of surface fuel loads. This
   case study provides baseline data for examining post-fire fuel carbon
   dynamics in coastal-transitional British Columbia.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important management tool in east Africa as a way
   to improve foraging conditions for herbivores, and to make wildlife
   easier for tourists to observe and photograph. Although past research
   has investigated the factors influencing herbivore use of post-fire
   vegetation, the temporal dynamics of these effects have seldom been
   documented, and use of burned areas by African carnivores has not been
   evaluated. Between 2008 and 2011, we studied responses of 8 common
   herbivores and 8 carnivore species to burns in the Mara-Serengeti
   ecosystem in southwestern Kenya by monitoring mammal abundance on 4
   transects from up to 136 days before burning, and up to 748 days after
   burning. Among herbivores, zebra, warthog, Thomson's gazelle, Grant's
   gazelle, and topi, occurred in higher densities in burned than unburned
   areas. Impala and wildebeest showed trends toward occurring in higher
   densities in burned areas. These effects lasted up to 120 days for
   Thomson's gazelle, but we did not observe a specific temporal
   relationship to burning in the other 5 herbivore species. Both small and
   large carnivores were more likely to be observed along transects after
   than before burns; we observed small carnivores including black-backed
   jackals, side-striped jackals, bat-eared foxes, and banded mongoose in
   greater numbers up to 365 days after burns but observed large
   carnivores, including African lions, spotted hyenas, leopards, and
   cheetahs, in greater numbers only for up to 120 days after burns. Our
   results indicate that wildlife responses to prescribed fire last 1 year
   in this region. Although burning stimulates vegetation growth and
   improves wildlife visibility, managers should recognize that wildlife
   responses might not persist for more than a few months in tropical
   African savannas like the one monitored here. (c) 2014 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{QuestionsThe degree to which renosterveld shrublands are fire-dependent
   is currently unclear. To address this issue, the following questions
   were asked: (1) does smoke stimulate germination of soil-stored seeds in
   renosterveld; (2) does recently-burned renosterveld display changed
   composition and higher diversity than unburned vegetation; and (3) how
   do the species compositions of renosterveld soil seed banks and standing
   vegetation compare?
   LocationSwartland, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa.
   MethodsSoil seed bank samples from a north- and south-facing slope were
   smoke-treated and germinated to test for smoke-stimulated germination.
   Burned standing vegetation was surveyed 16months post-fire, as was
   unburned vegetation on the same slopes. Seed bank species richness and
   density were compared between smoke-treated and untreated samples within
   and between slopes. Burned and unburned standing vegetation were
   compared within and between slopes in terms of species richness,
   abundance and aerial cover. Compositional similarity of the seed banks
   and standing vegetation was assessed.
   ResultsSeed banks were dominated by annuals and graminoids. Smoke
   treatment had no effect, except for driving significantly higher species
   richness and seedling density in south-facing slope perennial shrubs.
   Species richness and seedling density were significantly higher in seed
   banks on the south-facing slope compared to the north-facing slope.
   Burned standing vegetation exhibited significantly higher diversity than
   unburned vegetation. Annuals and graminoids displayed significantly
   higher species richness and aerial cover in burned renosterveld. The
   north-facing slope contained less than half the number of species/m(2)
   compared to the south-facing slope. The seed banks and standing
   vegetation showed low to intermediate similarity (SOrensen=31\%-53\%),
   but grouped close together on an NMDS plot, suggesting intermediate
   similarity overall.
   ConclusionsElevated germination of perennial shrubs in smoke-treated
   seed bank samples and increased diversity of post-fire standing
   vegetation suggest the renosterveld in this study shows elements of a
   fire-driven system. Certain species only recruited in burned sites,
   suggesting fire-stimulated germination. Aspect had a major influence on
   plant community composition, with the mesic south-facing slope being
   more diverse than the xeric north-facing slope. The similarity between
   the seed banks and standing vegetation was higher than previously shown
   for renosterveld, and appears to be higher than for fynbos.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of artificial radionuclides and microelements during forest

   (90)Sr, (137)Cs, Hg, Cd, As, and other elements, additionally polluting
   components of forest biogeocenosis, at least, on the territories
   adjacent to the fire areas. The activity of element migration depends
   mainly on the biogeochemical characteristics of the elements, on the
   humidity of forest combustible materials, and on weather conditions.
   During the post-fire periods, redistribution of the elements occurs as a
   result of their transportation with melted snow and rainwater.
   Revegetation on forest fire burn areas additionally changes the element

Abstract = {{The assessment teams who make post-fire stabilization and treatment
   decisions are under pressure to employ more effective and economic
   post-fire treatments, as wild fire activity and severity has increased
   in recent years across the western United States. Use of forest-native
   wood-based materials for hillslope mulching has been on the rise due to
   potential environmental, erosion control efficacy, and economic
   incentives. One concern regarding use of woody materials prepared on or
   near burned sites is the wide range in the size distribution of the
   shredded materials. We tested three blends of shredded woody materials,
   each blend containing different amounts of fine (less than 2.5 cm in
   length) woody particles. The blends (AS IS with 24\% fines, MIX with
   18\% fines, and REDUCED with 2\% fines) were applied at 50 and 70\%
   ground cover to 5-m(2) plots containing burned soil placed at 40\% slope
   and evaluated through simulated rain events which consisted of a rain
   only, a rain plus low flow, and a rain plus high flow period. The
   REDUCED blend was the optimum for both runoff and sediment concentration
   reduction under conditions of rainfall and rainfall plus concentrated
   flow. There was no difference between application rates of 50 and 70\%
   for either of the rainfall plus concentrated flows tested. Our
   recommendation was that 50\% ground cover of the REDUCED blend was
   adequate for both rainfall and sediment reduction compared to a bare
   soil. The other two blends were effective in reducing runoff but not
   sediment concentration compared to a bare soil. The wood shred
   manufacturing and blending process resulted in two statistically
   different relationships between application rate and ground cover:

Title = {{Interactions between the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae) and
   fire in south-eastern Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{203-211}},
Abstract = {{Context. The superb lyrebird Menura novaehollandiae is thought to be an
   important ecosystem engineer that, through its foraging, accelerates the
   decomposition of litter in Eucalyptus forests. Lyrebird foraging is
   therefore likely to affect forest fuel loads and hence fire behaviour in
   these fire-prone forests. In turn, fire is likely to reduce the
   abundance and influence the distribution of lyrebirds.
   Aims. Our goal was to determine the impacts of a major bushfire on the
   habitat and food sources for the superb lyrebird and the effects of
   foraging activities of lyrebirds on litter fuel and potential fire
   behaviour in gullies of herb-rich foothill forests.
   Methods. The effect of fire on lyrebirds and their habitat in the
   post-fire environment was examined at the landscape-scale, 2 years after
   fire; and at the patch-scale, 3 years after fire. Paired exclusion and
   control plots were also used over a 9-month period to assess the effects
   of foraging by the lyrebird on litter accumulation and fuel
   connectivity. Fire-behaviour models were used to determine the potential
   influence of lyrebird scratchings on fire behaviour.
   Key results. At the landscape scale, lyrebirds were present in both
   unburnt and ground-burnt sites, but not in canopy-burnt sites. Within
   patchily burnt sites, lyrebirds favoured foraging in unburnt patches. On
   average, lyrebird foraging reduced litter fuel loads by25\%(1.66 t
   ha(-1)) in plots in which they were free to forage, compared with plots
   from which they were excluded, over a 9-month period. Fire-behaviour
   modelling showed that lyrebird foraging led to a lower likelihood of
   fire occurring and less intense fire.
   Conclusions. Distinctly different vegetation structure and composition
   between burnt and unburnt patches appears to influence both the foraging
   patterns and distribution of lyrebirds. Additionally, foraging by
   lyrebirds reduces surface fuel loads and fuel connectivity such that
   fire spread is likely to be inhibited.
   Implications. We propose that alternative stable states may emerge in
   Eucalyptus forests as a result of feedback mechanisms among lyrebirds,
   vegetation and fuel accumulation. Therefore, the ecological role of
   lyrebirds is an important consideration in forest fuel management and
   conservation in these extensive, fire-prone forests in south-eastern
   Australia.}},

Volume = {{353}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the drivers of tree mortality and survival is critical to
   developing conceptual and predictive models of fire effects on forest
   communities and landscapes. Individual tree characteristics (a function
   of species traits and tree size) govern tree- and community-scale
   mortality following fire, but mortality can also depend on tree density
   and effects arising from instantaneous extreme fire behavior. However,
   the relative importance and interaction of these factors are not well
   understood, especially for mixed-severity fire regimes. We sampled
   burned mixed-conifer forests dominated by western larch (Larix
   occidentalis) in the Bob Marshall Wilderness of Montana, U.S.A. We
   combined these field measurements with a remotely-sensed estimate of
   initial burn severity (dNBR) to test predictions about drivers of fire
   effects that produce heterogeneous post-fire tree and stand-level
   mortality. Tree survival 8-13 years after fire depended on complex
   interactions between species, size, and initial burn severity. Western
   larch experienced much higher survival than other tree species across
   tree sizes. Predictably, less fire-tolerant species experienced much
   lower survival than western larch. These tree-level probabilities in
   survival scale up to govern community-level mortality through
   variability in species composition. Greater relative abundance of
   fire-tolerant larch was associated with reduced levels of mortality at
   community scales. Interestingly, higher tree densities were either
   uncorrelated with community-level mortality or associated with lower
   community-level mortality. Our results show that traits of individuals
   can govern fire effects from trees to communities, and give rise to
   highly variable fire effects characteristic of mixed-severity fire. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to test whether changes in forest composition observed while
   sampling portions of the landscape originating from different fires may
   be explained by stand-level processes, I reconstructed species and stand
   dynamics for mesic sites in the mixed-boreal forests of Quebec. The
   stands studied are located in the forest surrounding Lake Duparquet in
   northwestern Quebec and originated from eight successive fires
   representing a chronosequence of 230 yr. Tree composition and ecological
   characteristics were assessed in 313 quadrats distributed systematically
   within the burned areas; one representative stand per fire, presenting
   the average species composition for clay soils with a moderate moisture
   regime, was selected for detailed dendroecological analysis. All living
   and dead stems (> 1 cm dbh) were mapped and cut down in a 20 x 20 m
   quadrat. Cross sections collected at the root collar and at every meter
   were analyzed using standard dendrochronological techniques. The age of
   the stand before the last fire was estimated using snags and logs
   located in, or in the vicinity of, each quadrat.
   A PCA (principal-components analysis) ordination of all quadrats shows a
   gradual change with time since fire from stands dominated by hardwoods
   (aspen and paper birch), to mixed stands with an important white spruce
   component, to coniferous stands dominated by balsam fir and white cedar.
   Despite variations in the age and composition of the stands before the
   last fire, they generally follow a common pattern characterized by
   post-fire hardwood dominance. Age structures show successive waves of
   aspen, birch, and fir recruitment, corresponding respectively to the
   post-fire cohort, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen cohort, and
   spruce budworm outbreaks. Each of these waves corresponds to a decrease
   in hardwoods and an increase in the conifer component of the stand.
   Suppressed white spruce individuals, recruited primarily as part of the
   post-fire cohort, experienced growth releases following the dismissal of
   the first aspen cohorts. White cedar increased in abundance late in
   succession and tended to outcompete balsam fir in old coniferous stands
   severely affected by spruce budworm outbreaks.
   The observed multi-cohort process contrasts with the simple replacement
   of hardwoods by conifers as suggested by observations of differential
   growth rates. The patchy distribution of conifer regeneration together
   with the poorer ability of conifers to rapidly fill gaps may explain why
   hardwoods are successfully recruited. This gradual rate of change,
   occurring over several generations, results in the maintenance of an
   important hardwood component in most stands even in the absence of fire.
   After 230 yr, stands are still mainly composed of trees originating from
   punctuated events such as fire, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen
   cohort, or spruce budworm outbreaks. This contrasts with old-growth
   boreal forests dominated by spruces in which a quasi-equilibrium is
   maintained by small canopy disturbances. The study confirms that changes
   in forest composition observed while sampling portions of the landscape
   originating from different fires may be explained by simple processes
   occurring at the stand level.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of rainforest pioneer trees into long-unburnt open forests
   has become increasingly widespread across high rainfall regions of
   Australia. Increasing tree cover can limit resource availability for
   understorey plant communities and reduce understorey diversity. However,
   it remains unclear if sclerophyll and rainforest trees differ in their
   competitive exclusion of understory plant communities, which contain
   most of the floristic diversity of open forests. Here, we examine dry
   open forest across contrasting fire histories (burnt and unburnt) and
   levels of rainforest invasion (sclerophyll or rainforest midstorey) to
   hindcast changes in understorey plant density, richness and composition.
   The influence of these treatments and other site variables (midstorey
   structure, midstorey composition and soil parameters) on understorey
   plant communities were all examined. This study is the first to
   demonstrate significantly greater losses of understorey species
   richness, particularly of dry open-forest specialists, under an invading
   rainforest midstorey compared to a typical sclerophyll midstorey.
   Rainforest pioneers displaced over half of the understorey plant
   species, and reduced ground cover and density of dry forest specialists
   by 90\%. Significant understorey declines also occurred with increased
   sclerophyll midstorey cover following fire exclusion, although losses
   were typically less than half that of rainforest-invaded sites over the
   same period. Understorey declines were closely related to leaf area
   index and basal area of rainforest and wattle trees, suggesting
   competitive exclusion through shading and potentially belowground
   competition for water. Around 20\% of displaced species lacked any
   capacity for population recovery, while transient seed banks or
   distance-limited dispersal may hinder recovery for a further 68\%. We
   conclude that rainforest invasion leads to significant declines in
   understorey plant diversity and cover in open forests. To avoid
   elimination of local native plant populations in open forests, fires
   should occur with sufficient frequency to prevent overstorey cover from
   reaching a level where shade-intolerant species fail to thrive.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreaks are rapidly spreading
   throughout subalpine forests of the Rocky Mountains, raising concerns
   that altered fuel structures may increase the ecological severity of
   wildfires. Although many recent studies have found no conclusive link
   between beetle outbreaks and increased fire size or canopy mortality,
   few studies have addressed whether these combined disturbances produce
   compounded effects on short-term vegetation recovery. We tested for an
   effect of spruce beetle outbreak severity on vegetation recovery in the
   West Fork Complex fire in southwestern Colorado, USA, where much of the
   burn area had been affected by severe spruce beetle outbreaks in the
   decade prior to the fire. Vegetation recovery was assessed using the
   Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) two years
   after the fire, which occurred in 2013. Beetle outbreak severity,
   defined as the basal area of beetle-killed trees within Landsat pixels,
   was estimated using vegetation index differences (dVls) derived from pre
   outbreak and post-outbreak Landsat images. Of the seven dVls tested, the
   change in Normalized Difference Moisture Index (dNDMI) was most strongly
   correlated with field measurements of beetle-killed basal area (R-2 =
   0.66). dNDMI was included as an explanatory variable in sequential
   autoregressive (SAR) models of NDVI2015. Models also included pre
   disturbance NDVI, topography, and weather conditions at the time of
   burning as covariates. SAR results showed a significant correlation
   between NDVI2015 and dNDMI, with more severe spruce beetle outbreaks
   corresponding to reduced post-fire vegetation cover. The correlation was
   stronger for models which were limited to locations in the red stage of
   outbreak (outbreak <= 5 years old at the time of fire) than for models
   of gray-stage locations (outbreak >5 years old at the time of fire).
   These results indicate that vegetation recovery processes may be
   negatively impacted by severe spruce beetle outbreaks occurring within a
   decade of stand-replacing wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{In fire-prone landscapes, knowing when vegetation was last burnt is

   two mallee woodland tree species in southern Australia. The models were
   based on stem diameters from similar to 1172 individuals surveyed along
   87 transects. Time since fire accounted for the greatest proportion of
   the explained variation in stem diameter for our two mallee tree species
   but variation in mean stem diameters was also influenced by local
   environmental factors. We illustrate a simple tool that enables time
   since fire to be predicted based on stem diameter and local covariates.
   We tested our model against new data but it performed poorly with
   respect to the mapped fire history. A combination of different covariate
   effects, variation in among-tree competition, including above- and
   below-ground competition, and unreliable fire history may have
   contributed to poor model performance. Understanding how the influence

   determining the generality of models that predict time since fire.
   Models that were developed in one region may need to be independently

   woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned
   spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify
   factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and
   (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A
   total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to
   investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest
   conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of
   burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large
   snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH).
   Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded ``pre-fire{''} snags for
   nesting whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and
   that were moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were
   concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of
   large snags (e. g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest
   patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and
   old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting. The
   decrease in the amount of late seral stands in managed forest landscapes
   raises concerns about the future availability of high-quality burned

Abstract = {{Context. Fire is a major ecological factor in many landscapes.
   Prescribed fires are often used in the management of vegetation for
   ecological values, wildlife habitat and reduction of risk of wildfire.
   However, debate continues over whether active fire management is
   beneficial to flora and fauna. Although bats comprise similar to 20\% of
   the world's extant mammal fauna, they have been largely ignored in
   studies investigating ecosystem response to fire, especially in
   Australia.
   Aims. In the present study, we aim to investigate the immediate
   responses of microbats to prescribed fires in a tropical eucalypt
   woodland.
   Methods. We used a replicated paired experimental design, consisting of
   burned and unburned treatment and control sites, to investigate how bat
   activity and community structure change following a prescribed fire.
   Key results. Total bat activity increased significantly following fire.
   Fire also resulted in changes in the bat species assemblage. Changes in
   community structure were driven by the following five species:
   Saccolaimus spp., Chalinolobus nigrogriseus, Chaerephon jobensis,
   Rhinolophus megaphyllus and unidentified Species c35. Activity of C.
   nigrogriseus, Saccolaimus spp., C. jobensis and Species c35 increased in
   the burned sites, whereas changes in the activity of R. megaphyllus were
   uncorrelated with the effects of fire.
   Conclusions. The effect of fire on these species is consistent with
   flight patterns and habitat use; species with higher wing aspect ratios,
   such as Saccolaimus spp., which are capable of fast flight but with
   limited manoeuvrability, became more active in the open conditions
   created by fire.
   Implications. The results of the present study suggest that prescribed
   fire as an environmental management tool may be beneficial to bats, at
   least in the short term, because it increases habitat suitability for a
   wider range of species.}},

Abstract = {{Although natural disturbance-based management systems support the use of
   clearcut harvesting as a means of emulating fire disturbance in boreal
   forest, there are continual concerns and uncertainties over the degree
   to which clearcutting alters forest ecosystem dynamics relative to
   wildfire. Here, we sampled 56 and 47 post-fire and post-harvest stands,
   respectively, to examine early tree community structural development in
   young boreal mixedwood forests in central Canada. We find that tree
   species diversity is higher immediately following clearcut harvesting
   compared with stand-replacing crown fire. We attribute this primarily to
   protection of advanced regeneration, suitable regeneration substrates,
   and propagule availability of shade-tolerant conifer species following
   harvesting compared with fire. Although both disturbances promoted early
   successional species, harvesting resulted in higher regeneration
   densities of late-successional conifers (Picea mariana (Mill.) and Abies
   balsamea (L) Mill.). Vertical height structure variation was higher
   after fire than harvesting, likely a result of spatial heterogeneity in
   burn severity. Although tree heights, corrected for stand age, did not
   differ between disturbances for Populus tremuloides Michx. and Pinus
   banksiana Lamb., they were shorter for Betula papyrifera Marsh. and
   taller for late-successional conifers following harvest. Higher tree
   species richness, regeneration densities, and tree heights of
   late-successional conifer species indicate that clearcut harvesting can
   potentially accelerate succession in boreal mixedwood forests; however,
   harvesting can reduce height structural variability. Furthermore,
   leaving Betula papyrifera to satisfy the policy requirement for green
   tree retention can negatively affect its post-harvest regeneration and
   growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Severe wildfires are increasing in extent in the western US. We used a
   matched-pairs design with plots in burned and non-burned areas to study
   effects of the East Amarillo Complex (EAC) wildfires on mixed grass
   prairie mean community composition and variability in composition.
   Species composition and ground cover data were collected at 5 study
   sites each year for three years following the EAC. Fire effects on mean
   species composition were analyzed with permutational analyses of
   variance; temporal patterns were analyzed with permutational anova and
   nonmetric multidimensional scaling; and an index of multivariate
   dispersion was used to assess variability in plant community
   composition. We found weak immediate impacts (year 1) of wildfire on
   mean species composition, but strong impacts by year three. Two general
   patterns of changes in mean species composition emerged: at 3 study
   sites, there was a progressive divergence in similarity between burned
   and non-burned areas following wildfire whereas at 2 study sites,
   wildfire effects lessened over time. In contrast, a trend of increased
   homogeneity in burned vegetation relative to non-burned vegetation was
   apparent at all 5 study sites 2 to 3 years post-fire; burned areas also
   had higher species diversity, higher evenness but similar species
   richness 3 years post-fire. Ground cover composition, which was
   immediately impacted by wildfire through removal of residual dry matter,
   was fully recovered to non-burned conditions 3 years after wildfire. We
   observed little seedling recruitment either of native or exotic species
   following wildfire. Community composition changes in burned areas were
   likely the result of changing dominance relationships among plants that
   survived the wildfires rather than the result of recruitment of new
   individuals in gaps created by dead plants. Given the growth form of
   perennial C-4 grasses and the fact that these grasslands evolved in the
   context of repeated fire, it is likely that changes in mean species
   composition and compositional variability are short-term responses.}},

Abstract = {{We show that Pinus pinaster provenance affects both seed germination and
   seedling recruitment after fire. This information is crucial for
   managers to select the best seed-provisioning populations when
   implementing reforestation programs to assist the natural post-fire
   regeneration of the species.
   Reforestation programs to assist natural regeneration of maritime pine
   (Pinus pinaster Aiton) forests after wildfires very often neglect the
   fire-adaptive traits of the selected seed-source populations,
   threatening future stand resilience to fire.
   We investigate the influence of seed provenance and weight on the rate
   and timing of seed germination, and on early seedling growth of P.
   pinaster after fire.
   We simulated conditions during fire by experimentally submitting free
   seeds from three P. pinaster provenances with contrasting levels of
   serotiny (from < 6 to > 58 \% of trees bearing serotinous cones within
   the population) to six combinations of temperature and exposure time. We
   fitted GLMs and LMs to test for differences among provenances in
   reproductive performance after the thermal shock treatments.
   Heavy seeds derived from the very low serotinous population exhibited
   greater tolerance to heat (higher germination rate, lower germination
   time, and higher seedling length) than the lighter ones from the highly
   serotinous population.
   The seeds enclosed in serotinous cones are, however, the only ones
   protected from high fire-induced temperatures, delaying release until
   favourable post-burn conditions for germination and seedling
   establishment. Therefore, selecting the best fire-adapted populations
   with the optimal serotiny level as seed-provisioning sources should be
   encouraged to ensure forest regrowth in fire-prone areas.}},

Title = {{Historical charcoal burning and coppicing suppressed beech and increased
   forest vegetation heterogeneity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Questions Long-term legacies of historical human activities in temperate
   forests are increasingly recognised as an important driver of vegetation
   diversity and composition. To uncover centuries-old legacies, novel
   approaches are, however, needed. Here, we combine anthracology of
   historical charcoal kilns and long-term vegetation resurveys. We asked
   whether the historical coppicing oriented on charcoal production
   affected tree-species composition and how the forest understorey
   vegetation changed after the coppicing was abandoned. Location Temperate
   broadleaved forests in the Slovak Karst National Park, central Europe.
   Methods To explore the historical forest structure and long-term changes
   in tree composition, we sampled charcoal remains from 28 historical
   kilns, identified the burnt tree taxa and estimated the original
   diameter of the burnt wood. To analyse the vegetation changes over the
   last four decades, we resurveyed plant composition of 60 quasi-permanent
   plots established in 1975. Results Historical charcoal burning was
   associated with coppicing, which decreasedFagus sylvaticadominance and
   favouredQuercusspp. in the tree layer. Several decades after the
   abandonment of coppicing, we observed the decline ofQuercusspp. and
   spread of shade-casting tree species with nutrient-rich litter. This
   probably triggered the identified demise of light-demanding species, the
   spread of nitrophytes and taxonomic homogenisation of the forest
   understorey. Conclusions The shift from historical coppicing to current
   high-forest management was likely a main driver of the observed
   taxonomic homogenisation and decline of light-demanding plants, as in
   other European lowland forests. Long-term data from charcoal kilns
   showed, however, that closed-canopy forests dominated by beech were
   historically more common and observed changes in vegetation thus
   represent a natural process. Findings also suggest that coppicing taking
   place over centuries enhanced diversity of forest understorey
   vegetation. Our novel approach combining a vegetation resurvey and
   charcoal kiln anthracology thus uncovered otherwise hidden links between
   current biological processes and the historical human legacies, with
   consequent important implications for nature protection and management.}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used in the central Appalachians to promote and
   maintain mixed-oak and pine forests, create open forest conditions,
   improve habitat for wildlife, and to reduce the risk of impact of higher
   intensity wildfires on human development. Few studies have investigated
   responses of terrestrial salamander populations to habitat management
   using fire, and estimated responses have been neutral, negative, and
   positive depending on geography, species, and fire-severity. We examined
   woodland salamander (genus Plethodon) population responses to habitat
   management using prescribed fire on Shenandoah Mountain in the George
   Washington National Forest in West Virginia and Virginia, USA. We
   focused on responses of the Cow Knob Salamander (P. punctatus), a talus
   specialist and species of high conservation concern, but also examined
   responses of the Eastern Red-Backed Salamander (P. cinereus), a
   widespread habitat generalist. Three burn units were subjected to two
   low-severity burns and one unit was burned five times with ca. 40\% tree
   mortality. Using a combination of nighttime visual encounter surveys and
   coverboard surveys, we compared terrestrial salamander abundance and
   body condition in unburned and burned areas. We also measured habitat
   characteristics at sampling sites to determine if prescribed burn
   histories were correlated with habitat conditions important to woodland
   salamanders. Mean abundance for P. punctatus was lower at sites that
   were burned, but there was not a strong burn effect for P. cinereus.
   Abundance of both species was positively correlated with canopy cover.
   Mean and median body condition index (BCI) score was higher for P.
   punctatus and lower for P. cinereus on the West Virginia side of
   Shenandoah Mountain, and lower in burned areas for both species.
   However, the most parsimonious BCI models did not contain the burn
   predictor. Management using prescribed fire altered microhabitat
   conditions that are important for woodland salamanders, such as canopy
   cover, leaf litter depth, and vegetation groundcover. Our study suggests
   that woodland salamanders in the central Appalachians can persist in
   forests managed using prescribed fire, but also indicates that
   prescribed fire can result in reduced habitat quality for some woodland
   salamander species.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing their initial colony is probably the most critical moment
   in the life of leaf-cutting ants. The non-establishment is connected to
   abiotic and biotic factors, and the high mortality rates of initial
   colonies are possibly associated with entomopathogenic or antagonistic
   microorganisms to the symbiotic fungus present in the soil, hosted by
   these ants. Fire in the vegetation, depending on the intensity, is known
   to cause significant changes to the soil physical, chemical, and
   microbiological properties. The impact of a fire in savannah vegetation
   (Cerrado) on the establishment of early colonies of Atta sexdens
   rubropilosa Forel (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was evaluated. For this end,
   two areas were selected, one where there had been an accidental fire,
   and a contiguous one with the same size and vegetation characteristics
   without burning. In these areas and in soil collected in the same areas
   and stored in the laboratory, females recently fertilized in the nuptial
   flight were placed to excavate the soil and establish their colonies.
   Post-fire changes in the soil chemical and microbiological properties
   were quantified and correlated successfully in the establishment of new
   colonies of this leaf-cutting ant. Under field conditions, the females
   of A. sexdens rubropilosa did not show preference for which areas to
   excavate: the ones that had been burned or the ones that were unburned;
   under this condition, no colony survived according to the evaluation
   performed 120 d after the nuptial flight. Under laboratory conditions,
   the majority of the females excavated the soil, whether it had been
   burned or not. However, the establishment of initial colonies was
   significantly higher in soils collected far from the surface and in
   areas that had not directly been affected by the fire, showing a
   negative effect of fire on colony establishment under laboratory

Abstract = {{Remnant trees in fields may facilitate regeneration in fallows by

   forest spare some trees to provide shade for crops. This study examines
   their effects on regeneration by comparing vegetation in quadrats
   beneath and away from their crowns, in fallows of varying age (3-20 y).
   For fallows of all age classes, plant diversity was not significantly
   different between positions. Trees accounted for larger proportions of
   species and stems beneath remnant trees. Herbs, principally large
   monocots, accounted for larger proportions away from trees. Basal area
   was much higher in quadrats beneath trees. In all quadrats, the majority
   of individuals belonged to species with aninial-dispersed seeds. These
   accounted for a larger proportion of individuals beneath trees (75\%)
   than away (64\%). Wind-dispersed species accounted for a larger
   proportion of stems away from trees (23.6\%) than beneath (11.7\%).
   These data suggest that enhanced seed rain by attraction of perching
   animals, demonstrated in a companion study, influenced regeneration
   patterns. Effects on regeneration were similar beneath trees of an
   animal-dispersed (Pycnanthus angolensis, Myristicaceae) and a

   eucalypt forest}},
Journal = {{PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{The expansion of rainforest trees into long-unburnt open forests is
   widespread globally, including in high-rainfall regions of eastern
   Australia. Increased tree density can reduce insectivorous bat activity
   and species richness by constraining echolocation and foraging success.
   Yet it is unknown whether sclerophyll and rainforest trees differ in
   their effects on open forest bat communities. We sampled insectivorous
   bats and nocturnal flying insects at two heights (understorey, canopy)
   in dry sclerophyll forest of eastern Australia with contrasting fire
   histories and levels of rainforest pioneer invasion. We found that both
   time since fire and functional identity of midstorey trees influenced
   the local bat community, whereas insect biomass had little effect.
   Long-unburnt forests with a rainforest pioneer midstorey had lower bat
   activity (63\% lower) and species richness (35\% lower) than recently
   burnt forests with a more open midstorey. Bat species richness also
   declined beneath the dense sclerophyll midstorey in long-unburnt
   forests, although was unaffected in the canopy above. Strong negative
   correlations between rainforest tree density and bat community activity
   and richness indicate that rainforest trees, in contrast with
   sclerophyll trees, exert additional negative control over open forest
   bat communities. Our results show that habitat suitability for
   clutter-intolerant bats declined well before the often-recommended
   maximum fire-intervals for dry open forest, providing evidence of an
   upper threshold for fauna conservation in rainforest-invaded open
   forests. To conserve bat communities in dry open forests vulnerable to
   rainforest invasion, fire should occur with sufficient frequency to
   prevent rainforest pioneers developing a dense midstorey that displaces
   clutter-intolerant bats.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we analysed the effect of a wildfire that occurred in
   2007 in a well-preserved Canarian pine forest located in the Integral
   Natural Reserve of Inagua'. This reserve has the highest level of
   protection of the Canarian Network of Natural Protected Areas. In 2009,
   we established in an area that was affected by fire in the central part
   of the reserve a grid of quadrats of 500x500m in size. Following the
   corners of the quadrats, we set up a network of 28 permanent square
   plots of 25x25m. Ten more plots were randomly located in a surrounding
   area unaffected by the fire, with similar vegetation and environmental
   conditions. We monitored the effect of fire on pine regeneration,
   species composition, soil nutrient composition and forest structure.
   Results indicate that, 4 years following the fire, the effect on soil
   nutrients is still evident, with a higher level of organic matter in the
   burned plots. However, fire effect on species richness and composition
   was not long lasting, with no significant differences between the burned
   and control plots. Regarding regeneration, the density of saplings older
   than 2 years was significantly higher in burned plots. Based on the
   results, we suggest that fire should not be considered disastrous from
   an ecological point of view in this plant community. Moreover, the
   current fire suppression policy and the highly effective work of forest
   fire fighters can exacerbate the well known fire paradox'.}},

   study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Heating any soil during a sufficiently intense wild fire or prescribed
   burn can alter that soil irreversibly, resulting in many significant,
   and well studied, long-term biological, chemical, and hydrological
   effects. On the other hand, much less is known about how fire affects
   the thermal properties and the long-term thermal regime of soils. Such
   knowledge is important for understanding the nature of the soil's
   post-fire recovery because plant roots and soil microbes will have to
   adapt to any changes in the day-to-day thermal regime. This study, which
   was carried out at Manitou Experimental Forest (a semiarid site in the
   Rocky Mountains of central Colorado, USA), examines three aspects of how
   fire can affect the long-term (post-fire) thermal energy flow in soils.
   First, observational evidence is presented that prescribed burns can
   alter the thermal conductivity of soils to a depth of at least 0.2m
   without altering its bulk density. Second, data are presented on the
   thermal properties of ash. (Such data are necessary for understanding
   and modeling the impact any remaining post-fire ash layer might have on
   the daily and seasonal flow of thermal energy through the soil.) Third,
   observational data are presented on the long-term effects that
   prescribed burns can have on soil surface temperatures. In an effort to
   quantify long-term changes in the soil temperatures and heat fluxes
   resulting from fire this study concludes by developing and using an
   analytical model of the daily and annual cycles of soil heating and
   cooling, which incorporates observed ( linear variation of) vertical
   structure of the soil thermal properties and observed changes in the
   surface temperatures, to synthesise these fire-induced effects. Modeling
   results suggest that under the dry soil conditions, typical of the
   experimental forest, the amplitudes of the daily and seasonal cycles of
   soil heating/cooling in the fire-affected soils will greatly exceed
   those in the soils unaffected by fire for several months to years
   following the fire and that these effects propagate to depths exceeding
   one metre.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{783-794}},
Abstract = {{The flammability and combustibility of plant communities are determined
   by species features related to growth-form, structure and physiology. In
   some ecosystems, such as the Mediterranean ones, these characteristics
   may contribute to the existence of fire-prone species. We measured
   several parameters associated with the flammability and fuel loading of
   dominant woody species with different post-fire regenerative strategies
   ( seeders and non-seeders) in shrublands in the western Mediterranean
   Basin. Overall, seeder species show lower fuel load but are more prone
   to burning owing to a higher dead-to-live fuel ratio, live fine-fuel
   proportion and dead fine-fuel proportion. Moreover, they burst into
   flame at lower temperatures than non-seeders. In the Mediterranean
   Basin, most seeder species emerged mainly during the Quaternary, under a
   highly fluctuating Mediterranean climate and during recurrent fires. We
   propose that properties related to the combustibility and flammability
   of seeders may be the result of selective pressures associated with both
   fire and climate. These results suggest that ecosystems dominated by
   seeder species are more susceptible to fire risk than those dominated by
   non-seeder species in the Mediterranean Basin. Therefore, the proportion
   of these types of species resulting from previous fire or management
   history is likely to determine the characteristics of future fire

   germinable seeds were from species in genera with small seeds exhibiting
   physical or physiological dormancy, and that are tolerant or require

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated
   species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically
   within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage
   logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a
   negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One
   strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on
   Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense
   snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely
   untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag
   islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve
   habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species.
   In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were
   effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following
   logging operations that covered 45\% of the burned area. We
   systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed
   Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and
   compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to
   other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined
   significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed
   Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral
   unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat
   for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this
   study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the
   first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year,
   which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed
   Woodpeckers postlogging.}},

Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{9-24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vegetative ash is known to alter post-fire runoff rates, in some cases
   decreasing runoff by protecting the underlying soil and in other cases
   aiding in the formation of a surface seal increasing runoff. Variability
   in this hydrological response of ash may reflect differences in the
   hydrologic properties of ash caused by shifts in its physical and
   chemical characteristics. This study investigated the physical (particle
   size and shape, particle density, bulk density and porosity) chemical
   (mineralogy and elemental composition) and hydrologic (water retention,
   hydraulic conductivity, and sorptivity) characteristics of laboratory
   and wildfire ash from the Northern Rocky Mountain region of the United
   States. A variety of techniques were used including scanning electron
   microscope, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and
   conventional soil science techniques. Laboratory ash samples were
   prepared by combusting fuel from three dominant trees species of the
   region (Pious contorta, Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii) at
   various combustion temperatures (300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 700
   degrees C or 900 degrees C). The main objectives of this study were to
   determine (i) how the physical (particle size and shape, particle
   density, bulk density and porosity) and chemical (mineralogy and
   elemental composition) properties of ash might explain variations in
   hydrologic properties (water retention, hydraulic conductivity, and
   sorptivity); (ii) whether wetting alters the physical, chemical and
   hydrologic properties of ash; (iii) whether ash characteristics could be
   linked to various stages of thermal decomposition and whether ash
   produced in the laboratory could be beneficial to understanding wildfire
   ash characteristics and (iv) whether ash hydrologic properties can be
   linked to simple metrics, such as calcium carbonate content or color,
   which can be used in rapid post-fire hazard assessment.
   Results of this study indicate that variation in the hydrological
   response of ash can be partially explained by differences in ash
   characteristics associated with combustion temperature. Depending on ash
   mineralogy, which was dictated by the level of thermal decomposition of
   organic material, ash particles can (a) contain micro-porosity
   contributing to total porosity values as high as 98\%; (b) shift
   hydraulic conductivity values orders of magnitude from 0.12 +/- 0.03 to
   0.002 +/- 0.0003 cm s(-1); and (c) chemically transform after initial
   hydration suggesting that ash layers could alter post-fire runoff
   response by creating a chemical crust. Furthermore while ash color is
   often used as an indicator of burn severity it may not be an accurate
   indicator regarding the hydrologic response of ash in post-fire systems.
   Instead carbonate content is suggested as a more informative aid in
   predicting post-fire hydrologic response. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{After decades of fire suppression in eastern North America, land
   managers now are prioritizing prescribed fire as a management tool to
   restore or maintain fire-adapted vegetation communities. However, in
   long-fire-suppressed landscapes, such as the central and southern

   both riparian and upland forest habitats. To address these concerns, we
   conducted zero-crossing acoustic surveys of bat activity in burned,
   unburned, riparian, and non-riparian areas in the central Appalachians,
   Virginia, USA. Burn and riparian variables had model support (Delta AICc
   < 4) to explain activity of all bat species. Nonetheless, parameter
   estimates for these conditions were small and confidence intervals
   overlapped zero for all species, indicating effect sizes were marginal.
   Our results suggest that bats respond to fire differently between upland
   and riparian forest habitats, but overall, large landscape-level
   prescribed fire has a slightly positive to neutral impact on all bats
   species identified at our study site post-fire application.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of resprouts and seedling recruitment to post-fire
   regeneration of the South African fynbos conifer Widdringtonia nodiflora
   was compared eight months after wildfires in 1990. Stems on all trees
   were killed by fire but resprouting success was > 90 \% at all but one
   site. A demographic study of burned skeletons revealed that prior to
   these fires, nearly all plants were multi-stemmed (4 - 9 stems/plant)
   and multi-aged, indicating continuous sprout production between fires.
   All stems were killed by these 1990 fires and at most sites > 90 \% of
   the stems were burned to ground level. All diameter stems were
   susceptible to such incineration as, at most sites, there was no
   difference in average diameter of stems burned to ground level and those
   left standing. Individual genets usually had all ramets incinerated to
   ground level or all ramets charred, but intact, suggesting certain
   micro-sites burned hotter, whereas other sites were somewhat protected.
   Although not true of the 1990 fires, there was evidence that
   occasionally Widdringtonia stems may survive fire. At one site, four of
   the 16 plants sampled had a burned stem twice as old as the oldest
   burned stem on the other 12 plants at the site, suggesting some stems
   had survived the previous fire (ca. 1970) and this conclusion was
   supported by fire-scars on these four stems that dated to ca. 1970.
   Based on the highly significant correlation between stem diameter and
   cone density left standing after the 1990 fires, we calculated that for
   most sites > 80 \% of the initial cone crop was incinerated by fire.
   This is important because we observed a strong relationship between size
   of the canopy cone crop surviving fire and post-fire seedling
   recruitment. Under these conditions we hypothesize that sprouting
   confers a selective advantage to genets when fires cause heavy losses of
   seed. The infrequent occurrence of sprouting in the Cupressaceae
   suggests the hypothesis that resprouting is an apomorphic or derived
   trait in Widdringtonia. Data from this study suggests resprouting
   provides a selective advantage under severe fynbos fires, which are not
   only `stand-replacing fires,' but also are intense enough to incinerate
   cone-bearing stems.}},

Abstract = {{Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent
   species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle
   (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount
   of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed
   Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the
   Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource
   selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by
   summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black
   Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection
   by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We
   estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28
   in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall
   prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource
   selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian
   framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in
   habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by
   MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer
   wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall
   prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size
   was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and
   was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home
   range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size =
   460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a
   tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal
   area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative
   value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more
   important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by
   exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This
   recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in
   summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50\% of summer wildfires
   >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of
   >= 27 m(2) basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high

Abstract = {{New fire disturbance regimes under accelerating global environmental
   change can have unprecedented consequences for ecosystem resilience,
   lessening ecosystem natural regeneration. In the Mediterranean Basin,
   fire dependent obligate seeder forests that are prone to increasingly
   frequent stand-replacing fires and then salvaged logged repeatedly can
   be vulnerable to additional disturbances for decades. In this study, we
   investigated, for the first time, the cumulative and interactive effects
   of two large high-severity fires at a short (< 15-year) return interval
   and the subsequent burned timber harvesting with biomass removal on the
   post-disturbance recovery of such forests. We further assessed the type
   and amount of the material legacies (deadwood) that persisted through
   the different post-disturbance successional trajectories, as well as the
   influence of these legacies on forest regeneration. The early recovery
   of the studied forests after two consecutive large fires and post-fire
   logging was, in the first place, driven by fire repetition, which led to
   reduced seedling recruitment and enhanced regrowth of resprouter shrubs.
   Despite no interactive effects between fire and logging were detected
   after a single large fire event, two repeated fires followed by salvage
   harvesting had a greater negative impact than two fires alone
   (synergistic effects) on seedling establishment; while a lower positive
   impact (subadditive effects) on the recovery of resprouter shrubs. There
   was also an interaction modification effect in which fire repetition
   worsened the per-unit impact of salvage logging on forest regeneration.
   Nonetheless, the residual legacies, i.e., fine and coarse woody debris
   (unburned needles, downed branches, pieces of deadwood, and burned pine
   cones) that remained after the manual harvesting of the burned trees,
   aided seedling re-establishment and hindered the regrowth of the shrubby
   understorey. These findings indicate that high-intensity salvage logging
   after two large high-severity fires at a short return interval is
   inadvisable in fire-prone serotinous pine forests, unless it explicitly
   retains the key material legacies that help tree natural regeneration
   and enhance ecosystem resilience to the next disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The fire avoidance hypothesis proposes that a benefit of seed dispersal
   by ants (myrmecochory) is to protect seeds from being killed during fire
   and to facilitate post-fire germination of seeds that require heat shock
   to break their physical dormancy. The aim of this study was to quantify
   the effect of fire and seed burial by a predominant seed-dispersing ant,
   Rhytidoponera metallica (subfamily: Ectatomminae) on germination levels
   of three ant-dispersed legume species (Pultenaea daphnoides, Acacia
   myrtifolia and Acacia pycnantha). Experimental burial of seeds within
   aluminium cans at a site prior to being burnt and at an adjacent unburnt
   site showed that fire increased germination levels, particularly for
   seeds buried at 1- and 2-cm deep and that overall, germination levels
   differed among the three plant species. To quantify seed burial depths
   and post-fire germination levels facilitated by R.metallica ants, seeds
   were fed to colonies prior to fire at the burnt and unburnt sites. Of
   the seeds buried within nests that were recovered, between 45\% and 75\%
   occurred within the upper 6cm of the soil profile, although
   unexpectedly, greater percentages of seeds were recovered from the upper
   0-2cm of nests in the unburnt site compared with nests in the burnt
   site. Germination levels of buried seeds associated with R.metallica
   nests ranged from 21.2\% to 29.5\% in the burnt site compared with
   3.1-14.8\% in the unburnt site. While increased seed germination levels
   were associated with R.metallica nests following fire, most seeds were
   buried at depths below those where optimal temperatures for breaking
   seed dormancy occurred during the fire. We suggest that R.metallica ants
   may provide fire avoidance benefits to myrmecochorous seeds by burying
   them at a range of depths within a potential germination zone defined by
   intra- and inter-fire variation in levels of soil heating.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{241}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Optimal foraging theory provides a powerful quantitative framework to
   reveal how foraging constraints and options define the interplay between
   forager and resource distributions. Although illegal hunting threatens
   wildlife worldwide, few studies have assessed the impact of poaching on
   the ability of animals to optimise their use of resources. We assessed
   how the risk of poaching hinders the ability of common reedbuck (Redunca
   arundinum), red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), and plains zebra
   (Equus quagga) to maximise their daily intake of digestible energy in a
   complex mosaic of post-fire vegetation, in a small fenced nature
   reserve. Optimality models predict that all species can maximise their
   intake of digestible energy by feeding in young post-fire patches (29-37
   days). We show that for all species, probability of finding and
   selectively using such high-value vegetation patches was higher at
   greater distance from points where poachers were likely to enter the
   reserve. For reedbuck, optimal patches were used only if they were > 3.4
   km from poacher entry-points. Red hartebeest became more likely to occur
   in optimal vegetation patches as the distance to likely poacher entry
   points increased. Only zebra maximized their daily intake of digestible
   energy regardless of the distance to poachers, but still selected areas
   where poaching was less likely. This study demonstrates how spatial
   patterns in poacher activities and post-fire vegetation interact to
   shape herbivore distribution. Understanding how herbivores track and use
   this post fire green-up of vegetation is important for protected area
   managers to understand the trade-offs that herbivores make when

   Implications for post-fire regeneration}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Members of the arid Australian mulga (Acacia aneura) complex are
   fire-sensitive shrubs that produce mast seed crops after exceptionally
   high rainfall years. Such years also drive widespread wildfires in
   inland Australia, as high rainfall causes grassy fuels to accumulate,
   thereby enabling fuel contiguity to occur. Despite seedling regeneration
   playing an important role in mulga post-fire recovery, a dearth of
   information exists on the dynamics of its seedbanks. Here we examine the
   temporal and spatial dynamics of mulga seedbanks after a region-wide
   masting event at Laycock's Sandplain, central Australia. Masting had a
   profound effect on seedbanks, producing massive but short-lived pulses
   of seed in upper soil layers. After seed fall, seedbanks declined
   rapidly, and within 18 months had been reduced by predator depredations
   to low pre-mast levels. Our results suggest that mulga masting should
   enhance resilience to burning by providing transient seed pulses during
   periods of high flammability (i.e. after heavy rainfalls). The results
   also suggest that burn intensity will influence post-fire regeneration,
   by interacting with seed germination biology and post-mast seedbank
   dynamics. In our discussion, we examine possible evolutionary drivers
   behind mulga seeding periodicity, and hypothesize that rain-driven
   masting in mulga is a fire-related form of environmentally predictive
   masting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plant species that have the potential to alter fire regimes
   have significant impacts on native ecosystems. Concern that pine
   invasions in the Southern Hemisphere will increase fire activity and
   severity and subsequently promote further pine invasion prompted us to
   examine the potential for feedbacks between Pinus contorta invasions and
   fire in Patagonia and New Zealand. We determined how fuel loads and fire
   effects were altered by P. contorta invasion. We also examined post-fire
   plant communities across invasion gradients at a subset of sites to
   assess how invasion alters the post-fire vegetation trajectory. We found
   that fuel loads and soil heating during simulated fire increase with
   increasing P. contorta invasion age or density at all sites. However, P.
   contorta density did not always increase post-fire. In the largest fire,
   P. contorta density only increased significantly post-fire where the
   pre-fire P. contorta density was above an invasion threshold. Below this
   threshold, P. contorta did not dominate after fire and plant communities
   responded to fire in a similar manner as uninvaded communities. The
   positive feedback observed at high densities is caused by the
   accumulation of fuel that in turn results in greater soil heating during
   fires and high P. contorta density post-fire. Therefore, a positive
   feedback may form between P. contorta invasions and fire, but only above
   an invasion density threshold. These results suggest that management of
   pine invasions before they reach the invasion density threshold is
   important for reducing fire risk and preventing a transition to an
   alternate ecosystem state dominated by pines and novel understory plant
   communities.}},

   To ground-truth ranges of NBR and dNBR that correspond to levels of burn

Pages = {{982-999}},
Abstract = {{Many forests and their associated water resources are at increasing risk
   from large and severe wildfires due to high fuel accumulations and
   climate change. Extensive fuel treatments are being proposed, but it is
   not clear where such treatments should be focussed. The goals of this
   project were to: (1) predict potential post-fire erosion rates for
   forests and shrublands in the western United States to help prioritise
   fuel treatments; and (2) assess model sensitivity and accuracy.
   Post-fire ground cover was predicted using historical fire weather data
   and the First Order Fire Effects Model. Parameter files from the
   Disturbed Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) were combined with
   GeoWEPP to predict post-fire erosion at the hillslope scale. Predicted
   median annual erosion rates were 0.1-2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for most of
   the intermountain west, similar to 10-40 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for wetter
   areas along the Pacific Coast and up to 100 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for
   north-western California. Sensitivity analyses showed the predicted
   erosion rates were predominantly controlled by the amount of
   precipitation rather than surface cover. The limited validation dataset
   showed a reasonable correlation between predicted and measured erosion
   rates (R-2 = 0.61), although predictions were much less than measured
   values. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting post-fire

Abstract = {{Fires in the Cerrado savanna are a severe form of disturbance, but some
   species are capable of resprouting afterwards. It is unknown, however,
   how and whether post-fire resprouting represents a stressful condition
   to plants and how their rapid re-growth influences both the production
   of biochemical compounds, and interactions with mutualistic ants. In
   this study, we examined the influence of post-fire resprouting on biotic
   interactions (ant-plant-herbivore relationships) and on plant stress.
   The study was performed on two groups of the extrafloral nectaried shrub
   Banisteriopsis campestris (Malpighiaceae); one group was recovering from
   fire while the other acted as control. With respect to biotic
   interactions, we examined whether resprouting influenced extrafloral
   nectar concentration (milligrams per microliter), the abundance of the
   ant Camponotus crassus and leaf herbivory rates. Plant stress was
   assessed via fluctuating asymmetry (FA) analysis, which refers to
   deviations from perfect symmetry in bilaterally symmetrical traits
   (e.g., leaves) and indicates whether species are under stress. Results
   revealed that FA, sugar concentration, and ant abundance were 51.7 \%,
   35.7 \% and 21.7 \% higher in resprouting plants. Furthermore, C.
   crassus was significantly associated with low herbivory rates, but only
   in resprouting plants. This study showed that post-fire resprouting
   induced high levels of plant stress and influenced extrafloral nectar
   quality and ant-herbivore relationships in B. campestris. Therefore,
   despite being a stressful condition to the plant, post-fire resprouting
   individuals had concentrated extrafloral nectar and sustained more ants,
   thus strengthening the outcomes of ant-plant mutualism.}},

Pages = {{17-31}},
Abstract = {{The soil seed bank plays a central role in the regeneration of obligate
   seeding species in fire-prone habitats. We evaluated how seed density
   and species composition changed with time-since-fire in the Florida,
   USA, rosemary scrub community. Because fire affects habitat availability
   and plant demographic variation, we predicted that soil seed density
   would be low in recently burned and long-unburned stands and high at
   intermediate time-since-fire. Seed bank soil samples were collected from
   a chronosequence of time-since-fire composited from two trials conducted
   in 1992-1993 and 2008-2009: two sites each of 3, 6, 10, and 24 years
   post-fire, and 3 long-unburned (similar to 67 years) sites. The seedling
   emergence method was used to determine species composition of the seed
   bank. Across all time-since-fire age classes, herbaceous species
   dominated the seed bank, while long-lived subshrubs and shrubs were
   present in low densities. Seed banks from sites three years post-fire
   were distinct from the other sites. When species were sorted as
   functional groups, seed density was related with time-since-fire for
   subshrubs and ruderal herbs, but not for scrub herbs and graminoids.
   Subshrubs and ruderal herbs had highest seed densities in recently
   burned stands. Seed densities of Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides
   Michx.) (the major obligate seeding shrub in this community) were
   associated with time-since-fire and showed highest densities at recently
   burned and long-unburned sites. The seed banks of two scrub herb
   species, paper nailwort (Paronychia chartacea Fernald) and nodding
   pinweed (Lechea cernua Small), were associated with time-since-fire.
   They reached peaks in density in the first ten years post-fire,
   corresponding with similar changes in their aboveground abundances with
   time-since-fire. Soil seed densities of several species and functional
   groups were associated with time-since-fire, but timing of peak seed
   density varied depending on species' life span and age of reproductive
   maturity.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon farming initiatives have rapidly developed in recent years,
   influencing broad scale changes to land management regimes. In the open
   carbon market a premium can be secured if additional benefits, such as
   biodiversity conservation or social advancement, can be quantified. In
   Australia, there is an accepted method for carbon abatement that
   requires shifting fire frequency from predominantly late, defined as
   fires occurring after August 1, to early dry-season fires or by reducing
   overall fire frequency. There is an assumption and some evidence that
   this might accrue co-benefits for biodiversity. We tested this
   assumption by comparing terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity patterns
   (richness and abundance of reptiles, birds and mammals) against
   increasing fire frequency in the early and late dry-season at the same
   spatial resolution as the fire management for emission abatement method.
   We systematically sampled 202 sites on Cape York Peninsula, and examined
   the relationship between vertebrate fauna, fire and environmental
   metrics. We found that within the approved vegetation type, open
   woodlands in tropical savanna woodland, early and late dry-season fire
   frequency had the same weak linear relationship with only some elements
   of the observed fauna. Additionally, the response of each taxa to fire
   frequency were different across broad vegetation structural categories,
   suggesting that a more nuanced species-specific monitoring approach is
   required to expose links between savanna burning for carbon abatement
   and burning for biodiversity benefit.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] The area burned in southern Africa during the 2000 dry season was
   mapped on a monthly basis from May to November using SPOT-VEGETATION
   (VGT) satellite imagery at 1 km spatial resolution. Burned areas were
   identified with a classification tree that relied only on the
   near-infrared channel of VGT. The classification tree algorithm yielded
   very accurate results ( Kappa = 0.93). However, when compared with
   burned area maps derived from 30 m resolution Landsat Enhanced Thematic
   Mapper (ETM+) imagery, the VGT 1 km burned area maps reveal variable
   accuracy, dependent on vegetation type and on the spatial pattern of the
   burned areas. Fire incidence was higher in the northern part of the
   study area, especially in Wetter Zambezian Miombo Woodland, Mosaic of
   Guineo-Congolian Lowland Forest and Secondary Grassland, Edaphic and
   Secondary Grassland on Kalahari Sand, Drier Zambezian Miombo Woodland,
   and Undifferentiated North-Zambezian Miombo Woodland. Fire incidence was
   lower in the eastern part of the study area and almost absent from the
   western and southern semiarid and desert regions. The most extensively
   burned countries were, in decreasing order, the Democratic Republic of

Title = {{Post-Fire Management Impact on Natural Forest Regeneration through
   Altered Microsite Conditions}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{High severity stand-replacing wildfires can deeply affect forest
   ecosystems whose composition includes plant species lacking fire-related
   traits and specific adaptations. Land managers and policymakers need to
   be aware of the importance of properly managing these ecosystems,
   adopting post-disturbance interventions designed to reach management
   goals, and restoring the required ecosystem services. Recent research
   frequently found that post-fire salvage logging negatively affects
   natural regeneration dynamics, thereby altering successional pathways
   due to a detrimental interaction with the preceding disturbance. In this
   study, we compared the effects of salvage logging and other
   post-disturbance interventions (adopting different deadwood management
   strategies) to test their impact on microclimatic conditions, which
   potentially affect tree regeneration establishment and survival. After
   one of the largest and most severe wildfires in the Western Alps that
   affected stand-replacing behavior (100\% tree mortality), a mountain
   forest dominated by Pinus sylvestris L., three post-fire interventions
   were adopted (SL-Salvage Logging, logging of all snags; CR-Cut and
   Release, cutting snags and releasing all deadwood on the ground; NI-No
   Intervention, all snags left standing). The differences among
   interventions concerning microclimatic conditions (albedo, surface
   roughness, solar radiation, soil moisture, soil temperature) were
   analyzed at different spatial scales (site, microsite). The management
   interventions influenced the presence and density of safe sites for
   regeneration. Salvage logging contributed to the harsh post-fire
   microsite environment by increasing soil temperature and reducing soil
   moisture. The presence of deadwood, instead, played a facilitative role
   in ameliorating microclimatic conditions for seedlings. The CR
   intervention had the highest soil moisture and the lowest soil
   temperature, which could be crucial for seedling survival in the first
   post-fire years. Due to its negative impact on microclimatic conditions
   affecting the availability of preferential microsites for regeneration
   recruitment, salvage logging should not be considered as the only
   intervention to be applied in post-fire environments. In the absence of
   threats or hazards requiring specific management actions (e.g., public
   safety, physical hazards for facilities), in the investigated
   ecosystems, no intervention, leaving all deadwood on site, could result
   in better microclimatic conditions for seedling establishment. A
   preferred strategy to speed-up natural processes and further increase
   safe sites for regeneration could be felling standing dead trees whilst
   releasing deadwood (at least partially) on the ground.}},

Abstract = {{Does recurrence of fires affect the composition and structure of
   Mediterranean plant communities? The post-fire regeneration of
   communities dominated by Pinus halepensis was examined using a regional
   approach in Catalonia (northeast Iberian Peninsula). Twenty-eight study
   sites were selected. Each site consisted of two adjacent areas that
   differed in the number of fires that occurred during a period of two
   decades. One area burned only once, in 1994 (recurrence category 1, r1);
   the other area burned twice, once between 1975 and 1993 and again during
   the same 1994 fire (recurrence category 2, r2). Eight years after the
   1994 fire, structural (height, cover, fuel model) and compositional
   (abundance of dominant species) data were collected, together with data
   on pine density and reproductive performance. The effects of fire
   recurrence, fire interval (FI), real solar radiation (RSR), and
   precipitation (PP) were analyzed. There was a structural simplification
   in twice-burned areas in comparison with once-burned ones. This
   simplification may result from changes in species composition and from
   differential growth potentials caused by effects of fire on soils. In
   addition, lower fuel loads occurred after two fires. Pinus halepensis
   populations declined and shrub abundance increased in twice-burned
   areas; an increase in grass abundance was not observed. Fire recurrence
   was the most relevant variable to explain differences in plant community
   characteristics. The importance of fire regime parameters in determining
   post-fire vegetation regeneration in Mediterranean-type ecosystems is
   underlined by this study.}},

Abstract = {{The studies, which were conducted in southern Poland, focused on the
   recovery of the herb layer in 17-year-old post-fire silver birch and
   black alder forests. Although both types of stands, which are of the
   same age, developed spontaneously, the alder stands occupied damper
   sites (with thicker A horizons that survived the fire) than those in the
   birch forests. We surveyed the migration rates of 44 woodland species,
   primarily ancient woodland indicators, into both forests and the
   potential differences in these rates depending on their moisture regime
   and the community type represented by unburned forests, which were
   treated as the source of the woodland species pool. Additionally, the
   role of local depressions with high humidity that were covered by
   post-fire alder woods in the colonization process, as well as species
   survivorship and recolonisation, were estimated. Woodland species showed
   diverse migration paces among the sites; most of them migrated faster on
   more fertile sites with a higher humidity. Small patches of post-fire
   alder woods contributed to the recolonisation process since many
   woodland species in the herb layer survived the fire due to its high
   humidity, which inhibited the intensity of the forest fire. The recovery
   of woodland species in post-fire woods is the combined effect of
   regeneration, which relies on autochthonic propagules, and secondary
   succession, which is based on allochthonic propagules. Local
   depressions, which provide refuges for fire-sensitive, dispersal-limited
   species, contribute to their survivorship and thus to the successive
   recovery of herbaceous layers after a fire.}},

Title = {{Effect of increased fire activity on global warming in the boreal forest}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{206-219}},
Abstract = {{Forest fires are an important disturbance in the boreal forest. They are
   influenced by climate, weather, topography, vegetation, surface
   deposits, and human activities. In return, forest fires affect the
   climate through emission of gases and aerosols, and changes in surface
   albedo, soil processes, and vegetation dynamics. The net effect of these
   factors is not yet well established but seems to have caused a negative
   feedback on climate during the 20th century. However, an increase in
   boreal forest fires is predicted by the end of the 21st century,
   possibly changing the effect of fires on climate change to a positive
   feedback that would exacerbate global warming. This review presents (1)
   an overview of fire regimes and vegetation succession in boreal forests;
   (2) the effects on climate of combustion emissions and post-fire changes
   in ecosystem functioning; (3) the effects of fire regime variations on
   climate, especially on carbon stock and surface albedo; (4) an
   integrative approach of fire effects on climate dynamics; and (5) the
   implications of increased fire activity on global warming by calculating
   the radiative forcing of several factors by 2100 in the boreal region,
   before discussing the results and exposing the limits of the data at
   hand. Generally, losses of carbon from forest fires in the boreal region
   will increase in the future and their effect on the carbon stock (0.37
   W/m(2)/decade) will be greater than the effect of fire on surface albedo
   (-0.09 W/m(2)/decade). The net effect of aerosol emissions from boreal
   fires will likely cause a positive feedback on global warming. This
   review emphasizes the importance of feedbacks between fires and climate
   in the boreal forest. It presents limitations and uncertainties to be
   addressed in future studies, particularly with regards to the effect of
   CO2 fertilization on forest productivity, which could offset or mitigate
   the effect of fire.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are one of the major causes of ecological disturbance in
   the mediterranean climate ecosystems of the world. Despite the fact that
   a lot of resources have been invested in fire prevention and
   suppression, the number of fires occurring in the Mediterranean Basin in
   the recent decades has continued to markedly increase. The understanding
   of the relationship between landscape and fire lies, among others, in
   the identification of the system's post-fire resilience. In our study,
   ecological and landscape data are integrated with decision-support
   techniques in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) framework to
   evaluate the risk of losing post-fire resilience in Pinus halepensis
   forests, using Cape Sounion National Park, Central Greece, as a pilot
   case. The multi-criteria decision support approach has been used to
   synthesize both bio-indicators (woody cover, pine density, legume cover
   and relative species richness and annual colonizers) and geo-indicators
   (fire history, parent material, and slope inclination) in order to rank
   the landscape components. Judgments related to the significance of each
   factor were incorporated within the weights coefficients and then
   integrated into the multicriteria rule to map the risk index.
   Sensitivity analysis was very critical for assessing the contribution of
   each factor and the sensitivity to subjective weight judgments to the
   final output. The results of this study include a final ranking map of
   the risk of losing resilience, which is very useful in identifying the
   ``risk hotspots{''}, where post-fire management measures should be
   applied in priority.}},

Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{5-13}},

Abstract = {{Soil enzymes are critical to soil nutrient cycling function but
   knowledge on the factors that control their response to major
   disturbances such as wildfires remains very limited. We evaluated the
   effect of fire-related plant functional traits (resprouting and seeding)
   on the resistance and resilience to fire of two soil enzyme activities
   involved in phosphorus and carbon cycling (acid phosphatase and
   beta-glucosidase) in a Mediterranean shrublands in SE Spain. Using
   experimental fires, we compared four types of shrubland microsites: SS
   (vegetation patches dominated by seeder species), RR (patches dominated
   by resprouter species), SR (patches co-dominated by seeder and
   resprouter species), and IP (shrub inter-patches). We assessed pre- and
   post-fire activities of the target soil enzymes, available P, soil
   organic C, and plant cover dynamics over three years after the fire.
   Post-fire regeneration functional groups (resprouter, seeder) modulated
   both pre- and post-fire activity of acid phosphatase and
   beta-glucosidase, with higher activity in RR and SR patches than in SS
   patches and IP. However, we found no major differences in enzyme
   resistance and resilience between microsite types, except for a trend
   towards less resilience in SS patches. Fire similarly reduced the
   activity of both enzymes. However, acid phosphatase and P-glucosidase
   showed contrasting post-fire dynamics. While beta-glucosidase proved to
   be rather resilient to fire, fully recovering three years after fire,
   acid phosphatase showed no signs of recovery in that period. Overall,
   the results indicate a positive influence of resprouter species on soil
   enzyme activity that is very resistant to fire. Long-lasting decrease in
   acid phosphatase activity probably resulted from the combined effect of
   P availability and post-fire drought. Our results provide insights on
   how plant functional traits modulate soil biochemical and
   microbiological response to fire in Mediterranean fire-prone shrublands.

Abstract = {{Acacia karroo has invaded large areas of the Hluhluwe part of the
   Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park, despite the relatively frequent fire regime
   (mean and median fire frequency of 2.9 and 1.3 years, respectively) of
   this area. We surveyed A. karroo demography and post-fire responses to
   determine what is facilitating this encroachment. We found no seedlings
   and few individuals with small lignotubers. This suggests that
   encroachment is due to release of already established individuals,
   rather than recent or continuous recruitment of new individuals.
   Post-fire height growth rates of basal resprouts is about 0.5 m y(-1),
   which is too slow for escape from damage by fire, given the present
   frequent fire regime. Analysis of post-fire responses suggests that
   individuals can resprout from the stem at relatively small sizes
   (1.2-2.2 m tall). We suggest that stems can incrementally grow beyond
   the zone of fire influence because post-fire resprouting does not only
   take place from the base, after individuals are above 1.2 m in height.
   Bush encroachment is suggested to be due to low fire intensity, which
   allows relatively small plants to resprout from the stem and thus
   incrementally grow in size until escape size.}},

Pages = {{309-317}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{World forests are undergoing contrasted trends. While in some areas
   pressures continue, in others these are decreasing, setting forests into
   a trajectory of recovery. However, disturbances can interact with this
   process, inducing shifts toward alternative states. Here we investigated
   the post-fire recovery of an ancient Pious pinaster forest with Quercus
   pyrenaica in the understory in Central Spain, in which intensive
   management had decreased. Post-fire forest recovery was sampled and
   stand history was characterized using forest planning records. Stand
   history, structure and other geophysical data, including fire severity,
   were utilized as predictors, as appropriate, of pre-fire stand structure
   and of the post-fire forest using boosted regression trees. We found
   that pre-fire Quercus stem density tended to be higher in stands without
   recent management plans, although overall stand structure was poorly
   predictable. The post fire forest was dominated by Pinus, Quercus, or a
   mixture of both. Pinus density was mostly unpredictable, while Quercus
   abundance was highly dependent on its pre-fire stem density: In stands
   with over 200 Quercus stems per hectare, the post-fire forest was
   dominated by Quercus. Therefore, fire mediated a forest shift from Pinus
   to Quercus, driven by the pre-fire colonization of Quercus in the
   understory in areas with a longer time without management plans.
   Arguably, in case of recurrent fire, shifts will continue occurring
   where Pinus is still dominant. However, in the longer term, Quercus
   persistence in the area is threatened by climate change, since the
   climate space will be drastically reduced for Quercus, not for Pinus.

Abstract = {{Despite being inundated for up to 9 mo of the year, black-water
   floodplain forests in the Brazilian Amazon are susceptible to fire.
   Post-fire tree mortality is higher and fire spreads further in the
   floodplain, compared with adjacent upland forest. To understand these
   differences between the two forest types, we compared how leaf
   decomposition and fine-fuel loads change with inundation and soil
   texture. Litterbags containing leaves of Clitoria fairchildiana were
   placed on upland forest floor and submerged at two depths in a backwater
   of the Rio Negro. We used 80 bags per treatment and retrieved subsets
   every similar to 16 d from which the contents were cleaned, dried,
   weighed and discarded. Over the 81-d experiment, upland leaves
   decomposed two to three times faster than submerged leaves. Fine-fuel
   biomass (litter + root mat) was measured at 28 upland forest sites and
   29 floodplain forest sites of the middle Rio Negro. Floodplain forests
   held about twice the fine fuel (25.9 +/- 10.6 Mg ha(-1)) of uplands
   (10.9 +/- 2.3 Mg ha(-1)). Upland soils had more sand but a carpet of
   fine apogeotropic tree roots was more common and thicker in floodplains.
   We infer that slow decomposition of submerged leaves leads to high tree
   mortality from fire in black-water floodplains by (1) increasing fire
   intensity due to high fine-litter fuel load and (2) making tree roots
   more vulnerable to burning because they form a peat-like mat to absorb
   nutrients from the thick litter.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire restoration of foundation plant species, particularly
   non-sprouting shrubs, is critically needed in arid and semi-arid
   rangeland, but is hampered by low success. Expensive and labor-intensive
   methods, including planting seedlings, can improve restoration success.
   Prioritizing where these more intensive methods are applied may improve
   restoration efficiency. Shrubs in arid and semi-arid environments can
   create resource islands under their canopies that may remain after fire.
   Seedlings planted post-fire in former canopy and between canopies
   (interspace) may have different survival and growth. We compared
   planting Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentataNutt.
   ssp.wyomingensisBeetle \& Young) seedlings post-fire in former sagebrush
   canopy and interspace microsites at five locations. Four growing seasons
   after planting, seedling survival was 46 and 7\% in canopy and
   interspace microsites, respectively. Sagebrush cover was 5.8 times
   greater in canopy compared to interspace microsites. Sagebrush survival
   and cover were likely greater because of less competition from
   herbaceous vegetation as well as benefiting from resource island effects
   in canopy microsites. Initially, post-fire abundance of exotic annual
   grasses was less in canopy microsites, but by the third year post-fire
   it was substantially greater in canopy microsites, indicating that
   resource availability to seedlings was greater, at least initially, in
   canopy microsites. These results suggest microsites with greater
   likelihood of success should be identified and then utilized to improve
   restoration success and efficiency. This is important as the need for
   restoration greatly exceeds resources available for restoration.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{627-635}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims The role of fire as a germination cue for
   Mediterranean Basin (MB) plants is still unclear. The current idea is
   that heat stimulates germination mainly in Cistaceae and Fabaceae and
   that smoke has a limited role as a post-fire germination cue, in
   comparison with other Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), suggesting
   that fire-stimulated germination is less relevant in the MB than in
   other MTEs. However, recent studies showed that the assembly of
   Mediterranean plant communities is strongly driven by post-fire
   germination, suggesting an important role for fire as a germination cue.
   We hypothesize that both heat and smoke have important effects on the
   different post-fire recruitment processes of MB species (e. g. level and
   rate of germination and initial seedling growth).
   Methods To ascertain the role of heat and smoke in the post-fire
   germination response of MB woody plants, a germination experiment was
   performed with seven heat and two smoke treatments on 30 MB woody
   species from seven different families, including species with
   water-permeable seeds and species with water-impermeable seeds.
   Key Results Heat stimulated the germination (probability and rate) of 21
   species and smoke in eight species, out of the 30 species studied. In
   addition, six species showed enhanced initial seedling growth after the
   smoke treatments.
   Conclusions The results suggest that both heat and smoke are important
   germination cues in a wide range of MB woody species and that fire-cued
   germination in woody plants of the MB may be as important as in other
   MTEs.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are an increasingly common disturbance influencing wood
   recruitment to streams, and thereby affecting their physical and
   biological condition. Mediterranean countries such as Portugal, where
   more than 25\% of the land area has burned since 1990, are ideal areas
   to study impacts of wildfire effects on streams. We evaluated the
   physical structure of 2206 downed wood pieces (DWP) across 27 first- to
   third-order streams in central Portugal, all of which had experienced
   recent wildfires. The streams flowed through monospecific upland forests
   of Eucalyptus, Maritime pines, or Cork oaks and were fringed by a
   mixture of riparian tree species. DWP structure differed between tree
   types and between burned and unburned pieces. Post-fire
   timber-production forests (Maritime pines and Eucalyptus) contributed a
   higher quantity of thinner, longer and straighter DWP to streams than
   Cork oak stands. Pieces from Maritime pines had more rootwads and
   branches than DWP from the other tree types. Pieces from Cork oak and
   riparian species generally had a bent form, were shorter and had no
   rootwads. Burned DWP in streams were often from riparian trees. Relative
   to unburned DWP, the burned DWP occurred more frequently, were larger
   and straighter, had branches less often, and were more decayed. With
   more complex branches, rootwads, and a larger diameter, inputs from
   burned Maritime pine forests are more likely to change stream hydraulics
   and habitat complexity, relative to inputs from Eucalyptus forests with
   their simpler structure. This study shows that, less than a decade after
   wildfires, structure of downed wood in and near streams is strongly
   influenced by wildfire, but also still reflects intrinsic species
   characteristics and respective silviculture practices, even after the
   effects of fire have been accounted for. Under an anticipated shift in
   landscape cover with higher shrubland proportions and more mixing of
   Maritime pine and Eucalyptus forests, our results suggest that instream
   large wood will become scarcer and more structurally homogeneous. (C)

Abstract = {{Questions: What is the variability in abundance of lichens on grassland
   soil between and within fields after prescribed fire? Is post-fire
   lichen abundance an effect of pre-fire population size?
   Location: Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota, USA.
   Methods: Lichen abundance, estimated as ground cover and dominated by
   Cladonia spp., was mapped in plots in two fields before prescribed
   burning on 06.10.2003 and 15.10.2003 for the first time since
   abandonment in the 1950s. The plots were resurveyed one year post-fire.
   Results: Post-fire cover of Cladonia spp. varied strongly between the
   fields, most likely due to different weather conditions between the burn
   events, which resulted in different fire intensities, one of low and one
   of high intensity. In the field that experienced the low intensity fire,
   post-fire cover of Cladonia spp. was still relatively high, and showed a
   positive relationship with pre-fire cover, while no such relationship
   was found after the high intensity fire. In that field Cladonia spp.
   experienced high mortality rates irrespective of pre-fire cover.
   Conclusions: This study provides an example of how species response to
   disturbance can be a function of population size, but that this
   relationship can be non-linear; lichens in grassland can survive a low
   intensity fire proportionally to pre-fire population size, but
   experience high mortality rates above a fire intensity threshold. The
   applications of these results are that fire intensity matters to species
   response to prescribed fire, and that the persistence of climax lichen
   communities and biodiversity in the study system needs a broad range of
   fire intervals.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed (controlled) fire has recently been adopted as an important
   wildfire-fighting strategy in the Mediterranean. Relatively little
   research, however, has assessed its impacts on soil erosion and soil
   quality. This paper investigates hillslope-scale losses of soil, organic
   matter and selected nutrients before and after a `worst-case scenario'
   prescribed fire in a steep, shrub-vegetated catchment with thin stony
   soil in central Portugal. Comparison is made with soil erosion measured:
   (I) on a nearby hillslope burned by wildfire and monitored at the
   hillslope scale; and (2) on long-unburned terrain at small-plot,
   hillslope- and catchment-scales. Hillslope-scale pre- and post-fire soil
   erosion was recorded over periods of 6 weeks to 5 months for (1) 9.5
   months pre-fire and 27 months post-fire in the prescribed fire
   catchment, and (2) c. 3 years post-fire at the wildfire site. Organic
   matter content, pH, total N, K2O, P2O5, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were measured in
   the eroded sediment and in pre- and post-prescribed fire surface soil.
   Results indicate that: (1) both the prescribed fire and the wildfire
   caused expected marked increases in erosion compared with unburned
   terrain; and (2) the hillslope-scale post-prescribed fire soil losses
   (up to 2.41 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) exceeded many reported plot-scale
   post-prescribed fire and post-wildfire erosion rates in the
   Mediterranean. As a comparison, post-fire erosion for both fire types
   was less than that caused by some other forms of common soil disturbance
   (e.g. types of tillage) and even that on undisturbed shrubland in low
   rainfall areas of the region. Total estimated post-prescribed fire
   particulate losses of organic matter and nutrients represent only
   0.2-2.9\% of the content in the upper 2 cm of soil, suggesting only a
   modest fire effect on soil quality, although this may reflect in part a
   lack of extreme rainfall events following the fire. The longer-term
   implications for soil conservation of repeated prescribed fire in the
   Mediterranean are explored and future research priorities identified.

Abstract = {{Post-fire recovery of arid shrublands is typically slow, and planting
   greenhouse-raised seedlings may be a means of jump-starting this
   process. Recovery can be further accelerated by understanding the
   factors controlling post-planting survival. In fall 2007 and 2009, we
   outplanted seedlings of two contrasting native evergreen
   shrubs-fast-growing Nevada jointfir and slow-growing blackbrush-across
   five burned sites in the Mojave Desert. To increase soil moisture and
   optimize seedling survival, we experimentally applied and evaluated soil
   amendments and supplemental watering. We also evaluated two herbicides
   that reduce competitive invasive annual grasses and two types of
   herbivore protection. Survival of jointfir outplanted in 2007 was 61\%
   after 43 months, and site largely influenced survival, while herbicide
   containing imazapic applied more than one year after outplanting reduced
   survival. Reduced survival of jointfir outplanted in 2009 coincided with
   delayed seasonal precipitation that intensified foliar damage by small
   mammals. In contrast, blackbrush survival was 4\% after 43 months, and
   was influenced by site, type of herbivore protection, and greenhouse
   during the 2007 outplanting, and soil amendment during 2009. Counter to
   expectations, we found that supplemental watering and soil amendments
   did not influence long-term survival of either blackbrush or jointfir.
   Shrub species with rapid growth rates and broad environmental
   tolerances, such as jointfir, make ideal candidates for outplanting,
   provided that seedlings are protected from herbivores. Re-introduction
   of species with slow growth rates and narrow environmental tolerances,
   such as blackbrush, requires careful consideration to optimize pre- and
   post-planting conditions.}},

Volume = {{457}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Limber pine (Anus flexilis), an understudied tree species important to
   montane and subalpine ecosystems, is listed as endangered in Alberta.
   Dispersal of seeds to newly disturbed, open areas by Clark's nutcracker
   (Nucifraga columbiana) is expected to facilitate post-disturbance
   establishment of limber pine. Prescribed burning has thus been proposed
   as a tool to stimulate natural regeneration, but no studies have yet
   surveyed limber pine's regenerative response to disturbance at the
   northernmost extent of its range. We examined post-fire regeneration in
   one prescribed burn and one wildfire at the northern edge of limber
   pine's distribution and compared this to a regeneration baseline of
   plots in nearby unburned limber pine acting as seed sources to the bums.
   Using a likelihood-based approach, we then compared hypotheses of
   ecological processes influencing seedling occurrence and abundance.
   Overall, we found only six post-fire limber pine seedlings within the
   burns, as compared to one hundred twenty-four similarly aged seedlings
   found in unburned plots. Akaike information criterion (AIC) identified
   distance to a seed source and absence of canopy cover as hurdles for
   seedling establishment in the burn. Analysis of seedling abundance was
   performed on only the unburned dataset due to low regeneration in the
   burned areas surveyed; model selection here showed that when distance to
   a seed source is small, substrate variables, including less prevalent
   bare mineral soil, more rocky cover, and finer soil textures, take on an
   important role in driving abundance. Substrates important for limber
   pine abundance in unburned stands were found with similar frequency in
   the burns, indicating limber pine colonization post-disturbance was not
   substrate limited but instead constrained by other factors. Our findings
   suggest that extensive prescribed burns and stand-replacing wildfire
   events at the northern extent of limber pine's range may have limited
   seedling regeneration in the immediate post-fire period. Conservation
   efforts may be well-served by focusing on fire mitigation efforts, such
   as thinning and other fuel treatments, in areas surrounding established
   limber pine stands. Finally, post-disturbance stands could benefit from
   supplementary seedling plantings to achieve recovery plan restoration
   goals for this endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are a pervasive disturbance in boreal forests, and the
   frequency and intensity of boreal wildfires is expected to increase with
   climate warming. Boreal forests store a large fraction of global soil
   organic carbon (C), but relatively few studies have documented how
   wildfires affect soil microbial communities and soil C dynamics. We used
   a fire chronosequence in upland boreal forests of interior Alaska with
   sites that were 1, 7, 12, 24, 55, 90, and 100 years post-fire to examine
   the short- and long-term responses of fungal community composition,
   fungal abundance, extracellular enzyme activity, and litter
   decomposition to wildfires. We hypothesized that post-fire changes in
   fungal abundance and community composition would constrain decomposition
   following fires. We found that wildfires altered the composition of soil
   fungal communities. The relative abundance of ascomycetes significantly
   increased following fire whereas basidiomycetes decreased. Post-fire
   decreases in basidiomycete fungi were likely attributable to declines in
   ectomycorrhizal fungi. Fungal hyphal lengths in the organic horizon
   significantly declined in response to wildfire, and they required at
   least 24 years to return to pre-fire levels. Post-fire reductions in
   fungal hyphal length were associated with decreased activities of
   hydrolytic extracellular enzymes. In support of our hypothesis, the
   decomposition rate of aspen and black spruce litter significantly
   increased as forests recovered from fire. Our results indicate that
   post-fire reductions in soil fungal abundance and activity likely
   inhibit litter decomposition following boreal wildfires. Slower rates of
   litter decay may lead to decreased heterotrophic respiration from soil
   following fires and contribute to a negative feedback to climate
   warming.}},

   significant land degradation problems in the area around Bandawe,

   of woodland. Gully erosion was common and primarily associated with
   heavily utilised footpaths. Areas between gullies showed signs of
   significant soil movement. Remnant patches of native woodland existed
   but were small, degraded and isolated. We interviewed local households
   to understand local awareness and impacts of land-degradation, its
   perceived cause and preferred methods for restoration. All households
   were aware of the presence of gullies and reported associated problems
   of flood damage. Most households believed erosion was a result of
   deforestation. Burning practices were seen to have exacerbated erosion
   problems. Changing fire management practice was not seen as realistic as
   it risked reducing the productivity of grasses and fires were perceived
   to be too difficult to control. Tree planting was the community's
   preferred approach to tackling erosion. Their focus was on planting
   exotic fruit and timber trees around houses and they often requested
   that such work be done by volunteers. Such attitudes may have been
   influenced by recent extension work and a desire to secure ownership of

Abstract = {{Management around wilderness parks ideally requires thorough fire
   suppression in proximate settled and commercially exploited lands and
   natural fire within protected areas. To satisfy these requirements, we
   explored a potential regional firebreak (firewall) based on a series of
   prescribed burns in Quetico Provincial Park in northwestern Ontario,
   Canada. Fire managers were recruited each to independently devise a
   regional firebreak using simulated prescribed burns. The experts' five
   designs consisted of between 9 and 25 prescribed burns, set over periods
   ranging from 3 to 8 years, and covering from 7900 to 26,100 ha. Each
   wildlife ignition was run after the entire firebreak was created and the
   vegetation was reclassified to account for post-fire vegetation
   re-growth. The potential efficacy of each design was tested using
   worst-case historical weather and 100 random ignitions in the Prometheus
   fire growth simulation model. Without a firewall, 100 ignitions resulted
   in 69 fires escaping the park and consuming 483,900 ha of forest beyond
   the park boundary. The firewall designs were all effective, reducing the
   area burned outside the park to between 15,400 and 35,400 ha. There was
   a 77-90\% reduction in the number of fires escaping the firewall areas
   and an average reduction of fire area beyond the park of 92\%. Moreover,
   one can map the geographic weak points in each design, which encourages
   iterative firebreak design improvements. For instance, firewalls set
   nearer the park boundary allowed fewer fires to start between the
   firewall and the boundary, so increasing firebreak effectiveness. The
   cost of the above systems can be regarded as taking preventative
   measures against the risk of future economic loss, and the modeling
   approach reduces the uncertainties in associated decision making. (C)

Abstract = {{The Tasmanian bettong, Bettongia gaimardi, is a mycophagous marsupial
   that occurs in fire-prone dry sclerophyll forests. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that some of the hypogeous fungi on which it feeds become
   abundant soon after fire, and have suggested that it might depend on
   regular burning of its habitat. The longer-term effects of burning on B.
   gaimardi and its food supply were evaluated by comparing six sites,
   matched for soil, vegetation and climate, in southeastern Tasmania that
   had been left unburnt for periods ranging from 1 to 50 years. At each
   site, the density of B. gaimardi diggings was measured and sporocarps of
   hypogeous fungi were surveyed. Abundance of hypogeous sporocarps was low
   at sites 2 years or less post-fire, but was high at sites 4 years and
   more postfire. Species richness was similarly low at recently burnt
   sites, an effect that was due to the absence of many shallow-fruiting
   taxa. All species (with one exception) present at recently burnt sites
   were also present in long-unburnt sites. Densities of B. gaimardi
   diggings were highest at a very recently burnt (<1 year) site and at a

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, wildfires have affected vast areas of
   Mediterranean ecosystems leading to a variety of negative on-and
   off-site environmental impacts. Research on fire-affected areas has
   given more attention to sediment losses by fire-enhanced overland flow
   than to nutrient exports, especially in the Mediterranean region. To
   address this knowledge gap for post-fire losses of phosphorus (P) by
   overland flow, a recently burnt forest area in north-central Portugal
   was selected and instrumented immediately after a wildfire. Three slopes
   were selected for their contrasting forest types (eucalypt vs. pine) and
   parent materials (granite vs. schist). The selected study sites were a
   eucalypt site on granite (BEG), a eucalypt site on schist (BES) and a
   maritime pine site on schist (BPS). Micro-plots were monitored over a
   period of six months, i.e. till the construction of terraces for
   reforestation obliged to the removal of the plots. During this 6-month
   period, overland flow samples were collected at 1 to 2-weekly intervals,
   depending on rainfall. Total P and PO4-P losses differed markedly
   between the two types of forests on schist, being lower at the pine site
   than at the eucalypt site, probably due to the presence of a protective
   layer of pine needle cast. Parent material did not play an important
   role in PO4-P losses by overland flow but it did in TP losses, with
   significantly lower values at the eucalypt site on granite than that on
   schist. These differences in TP losses can be attributed to the coarser
   texture of granite soils, typically promoting infiltration and
   decreasing runoff. The present findings provided further insights into
   the spatial and temporal patterns of post-fire soil nutrient losses in
   fire-prone forest types during the initial stages of the
   window-of-disturbance, which can be useful for defining post-fire
   emergency measures to reduce the risk of soil fertility losses. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{QuestionResistance of the native community has been identified as an

   to what extent resistance interacts with disturbance to control invasion
   success remains unclear. We studied the interaction between biotic
   resistance, fire and small-scale disturbances mimicking those of large
   mammalian herbivores (hoof action and grazing) on invasion success of
   the alien shrub Chromolaena odorata.
   LocationHluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa.
   MethodsWe performed a seedling transplant experiment in a savanna
   grassland. We manipulated the grass layer by clipping (grazing), created
   small-scale soil disturbances (hoof action) and transplanted seedlings
   under native tree canopies to assess potential nursing effects.
   Subsequently, we burned half of our plots. We assessed the effect of
   fire and small-scale disturbances on seedling growth, survival and
   biomass allocation.
   ResultsSeedling survival of C.odorata was 26\% in undisturbed savanna
   grassland, reducing to 5\% post-fire. Small-scale disturbances increased
   seedling biomass and survival and modified biomass allocation, whereas
   fire greatly reduced seedling survival. Root allocation increased in
   response to grass clipping, while stem allocation decreased. Tree
   shading increased seedling survival in the absence of fire, but greatly
   reduced post-fire survival.
   ConclusionsGrass communities in savannas exert a high level of biotic
   resistance to C.odorata invasion. However, small-scale disturbances,
   mimicking those of large mammalian herbivores, can facilitate the
   invasion of C.odorata in savanna grassland both directly, by creating
   micro-sites for establishment, and indirectly, by reducing the negative
   effect of fire. Thus, small-scale disturbances may aid the long-term
   persistence of woody species invading grass-dominated systems.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{527-534}},
Abstract = {{The maximum solar elevation is typically less than 50 degrees in the
   Alaskan boreal region and solar elevation varies substantially during
   the growing season. Because of the relatively low solar elevation at
   boreal latitudes, the effect of topography on spectral reflectance can
   influence fire severity indices derived from remotely sensed data. We
   used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)
   data to test the effect of changing solar elevation and topography on
   the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the differenced Normalized Burn
   Ratio (dNBR). When a time series of unburned pixels from black spruce
   forests was examined, we found that NBR values consistently decreased
   from June through September. At the stand level, dNBR-derived values
   from similar unburned and burned black spruce stands were substantially
   higher from September imagery relative to July or August imagery. Within
   the Boundary burn, we found mean post-fire NBR to consistently vary
   owing to topographic control of potential solar radiation. To minimise
   spectral response due to topographic control of vegetation and fire
   severity, we computed a dNBR using images from August and September
   immediately after a June-July wildfire. There was a negative bias in
   remotely sensed fire severity estimates as potential solar radiation
   decreased owing to topography. Thus fire severity would be
   underestimated for stands in valley bottoms dominated by topographic
   shading or on steep north-facing slopes oriented away from incoming
   solar radiation. This is especially important because highly flammable
   black spruce stands typically occur on such sites. We demonstrate the
   effect of changing pre- and post-fire image dates on fire severity
   estimates by using a fixed NBR threshold defining `high severity'. The
   actual fire severity was constant, but owing to changes in phenology and
   solar elevation, `high severity' pixels within a burn ranged from 56 to
   76\%. Because spectral reflectance values vary substantially as solar
   elevation and plant phenology change, the use of reflectance-based
   indices to assess trends in burn severity across regions or years may be
   especially difficult in high-latitude areas such as the Alaskan boreal
   forest.}},

Abstract = {{Fire can be a dominant process in the ecology of forest vegetation and
   can also affect forest disease dynamics. Little is known about the
   relationship between fire and an emerging disease epidemic called Sudden
   Oak Death, which is caused by a new pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum. This
   disease has spread across a large, fire-prone portion of California,
   killing great numbers of oaks and tanoaks and infecting most associated
   woody plants. Suitable hosts cover a much broader geographic range,
   raising concern over where the disease may spread. To understand the
   strength and potential sensitivities of a fire-disease relationship, we
   examined geographic patterns of confirmed P. ramorum infections in
   relation to past fire history. We found these infections to be extremely
   rare within the perimeter of any area burned since 1950. This finding is
   not caused by spatial bias in sampling for the disease, and is robust to
   variation in host abundance scenarios and to aggregation of closely
   spaced sampling locations. We therefore investigated known fire-related
   factors that could result in significantly lower incidence of the
   disease in relatively recently burned landscapes. Chemical trends in
   post-fire environments can influence the success of pathogens like P.
   ramorum, either by increasing plant nutrient stress or by reducing the
   occurrence of chemicals antagonistic to Phytophthoras. Succession in the
   absence of fire leads to greater abundance of host species, which will
   provide increased habitat for P. ramorum; this will also increase
   intraspecific competition where these trees are abundant, and other
   density-dependent effects (e.g. shading) can reduce resource allocation
   to defenses. Despite these findings about a fire-disease relationship, a
   much deeper understanding is necessary before fire can be actively used
   as a tool in slowing the epidemic.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in the emissions and associated atmospheric deposition of
   nitrogen (N) have the potential to cause significant changes to the
   structure and function of N-limited ecosystems. Here, we present the
   results of a long-term (13 similar to year) experiment assessing the
   impacts of N addition (30 similar to kg similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1)
   on a UK lowland heathland under a wide range of environmental
   conditions, including the occurrence of prolonged natural drought
   episodes and a severe summer fire. Our findings indicate that elevated N
   deposition results in large, persistent effects on Calluna growth,
   phenology and chemistry, severe suppression of understorey lichen flora
   and changes in soil biogeochemistry. Growing season rainfall was found
   to be a strong driver of inter-annual variation in Calluna growth and,
   although interactions between N and rainfall for shoot growth were not
   significant until the later phase of the experiment, N addition
   exacerbated the extent of drought injury to Calluna shoots following
   naturally occurring droughts in 2003 and 2009. Following a severe
   wildfire at the experimental site in 2006, heathland regeneration
   dynamics were significantly affected by N, with a greater abundance of
   pioneering moss species and suppression of the lichen flora in plots
   receiving N additions. Significant interactions between climate and N
   were also apparent post fire, with the characteristic stimulation in
   Calluna growth in +N plots suppressed during dry years. Carbon (C) and N
   budgets demonstrate large increases in both above- and below-ground
   stocks of these elements in N-treated plots prior to the fire, despite
   higher levels of soil microbial activity and organic matter turnover.
   Although much of the organic material was removed during the fire,
   pre-existing treatment differences were still evident following the
   burn. Post fire accumulation of below-ground C and N stocks was
   increased rapidly in N-treated plots, highlighting the role of N
   deposition in ecosystem C sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{The Mountain Longleaf National Wildlife Refuge (MLNWR), located in
   northeastern Alabama, is unique in that it holds significant acreages of
   young and old-growth montane longleaf pine forest Wilms palustri.v
   Mill.). We conducted a study to aid in the management and restoration of
   longleaf pine communities on the MLNWR. Our objectives were to: (1)
   establish permanent forest monitoring plots; (2) document herbaceous and
   woody vegetation; and (3) measure forest diversity, structure, and fuel
   loads in montane longleaf pine communities with varying tire and
   management his We established 48 plots, 0.04 ha in area, in winter 2008
   and measured all plots in summer 2008. The MLNWR has recently
   incorporated prescribed burning in their management plans and each plot
   was categorized by the year it was burned (2008, 2006, 2004. no-burn)
   and whether hardwood control treatments were applied. We identified 18,
   19, and 22 different woody plant species in the overstory, mid-story,
   and understory, respectively, across plots. Longleaf pine basal area
   ranged from 5 to 10 m2 ha-t and represented as much as 80\% of basal
   area across plots. Mid-story basal area and woody plant species
   diversity were lower in plots receiving fire or hardwood control.
   Longleaf pine regeneration was found in only 17 plots and was highest in
   burned plots or plots receiving hardwood control. Burning also increased
   grass and herbaceous ground cover. Fuel loads were high with an average
   humus layer accumulation of 35 Mg ha -I. Regular fire intervals are
   needed to reduce fuels and mid-story density and aid in the regeneration

Abstract = {{Wildfires are a frequent occurrence in the Cantabrian mountain range in
   north-west Spain, causing erosion and soil degradation. With the aim of
   measuring this erosion, 43 soil cores were taken from four slopes with
   different degrees of fire frequency and (CS)-C-137 concentration. The
   four slopes are located in the same geographical area. They have a
   quartzitic substrate, with slopes of between 20 degrees and 30 degrees
   and share the same type of soil, elevation and orientation. However,
   vegetation cover is different as a result of the action of fire. Maps of
   the area, showing the burnt areas over the period 1984 to 2004 (remote
   sensing data), confirm the effects that fire has had. Soil cores were
   taken from transects on each slope and three reference samples were also
   taken from a high plateau in order to establish a reference value for
   (CS)-C-137 inventory. Soil redistribution rates (erosion and deposit)
   for the slopes could thus be calculated, according to whether (CS)-C-137
   inventory was higher or lower than the reference value. The values
   obtained show that (CS)-C-137 inventory is lower for the slopes with
   shrubby vegetation than for the reference samples and its distribution
   indicates higher erosion rates for the upper slope samples. Mean erosion
   rates obtained for these slopes were 6.75 t ha(-1) year(-1) and 6.6 t
   ha(-1) year(-1). These data are compared with erosion rates for
   (CS)-C-137 obtained in areas with different climates and patterns of
   land use. Cs-137 redistribution was not found on slopes with tree cover,
   suggesting that surface erosion has not occurred, or at least not during
   the time period for which (CS)-C-137 can be measured. Cs-137
   distribution was compared with the distribution of other variables and
   topographical indices (distance from the hilltop, accumulated flow,
   slope, curvature and CTI). The application of (CS)-C-137 in studies of
   post-fire erosion is relatively novelty and it a useful technique in
   post-fire erosion studies over long timescales and for study sites
   larger than point and plot scales. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{After a wildfire, the management of burnt wood may determine
   microclimatic conditions and microbiological activity with the potential
   to affect soil respiration. To experimentally analyze the effect on soil
   respiration, we manipulated a recently burned pine forest in a
   Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada National and Natural Park, SE
   Spain). Three representative treatments of post-fire burnt wood
   management were established at two elevations: (1) ``salvage logging{''}
   (SL), where all trees were cut, trunks removed, and branches chipped;
   (2) ``non-intervention{''} (NI), leaving all burnt trees standing; and
   (3) ``cut plus lopping{''} (CL), a treatment where burnt trees were
   felled, with the main branches lopped off, but left in situ partially
   covering the ground surface. Seasonal measurements were carried out over
   the course of two years. In addition, we performed continuous diurnal
   campaigns and an irrigation experiment to ascertain the roles of soil
   temperature and moisture in determining CO2 fluxes across treatments.
   Soil CO2 fluxes were highest in CL (average of 3.34 +/- 0.191 mu mol
   m(-2) s(-1)) and the lowest in SL (2.21 +/- 0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)).
   Across seasons, basal values were registered during summer (average of
   1.46 +/- 0.04 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), but increased during the humid
   seasons (up to 10.07 +/- 1.08 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in spring in CL).
   Seasonal and treatment patterns were consistent at the two elevations
   (1477 and 2317 m a.s.l.), although respiration was half as high at the
   higher altitude.
   Respiration was mainly controlled by soil moisture. Watering during the
   summer drought boosted CO2 effluxes (up to 37 +/- 6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)
   just after water addition), which then decreased to basal values as the
   soil dried. About 64\% of CO2 emissions during the first 24 h could be
   attributed to the degasification of soil pores, with the rest likely
   related to biological processes. The patterns of CO2 effluxes under
   experimental watering were similar to the seasonal tendencies, with the
   highest pulse in CL Temperature, however, had a weak effect on soil
   respiration, with Q(10) values of ca. 1 across seasons and soil moisture
   conditions. These results represent a first step towards illustrating
   the effects of post-fire burnt wood management on soil respiration, and
   eventually carbon sequestration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The success of tree plantings in agricultural landscapes within dry and
   variable rainfall regions is often below expectations. The aims of this
   study were to investigate techniques for establishing a local native
   species (Eucalyptus pauciflora) and an exotic species (E. nitens) in the
   Midlands of Tasmania, a tree-denuded region that has been grazed for
   over 100 years in Australia. We established trials at the Sorrel Springs
   and Woodland Park properties. We compared six establishment techniques:
   control; understorey nurse planting; spot burn; mulch; tree-guard and;
   self-watering tree-guard. Three months, 1 and 6 years after planting we
   measured tree height, health index and mortality. At Sorrell Springs
   tree-guarded treatments had greater height than other treatments at year
   one, but there were no effects of treatment at year six on height,
   health or mortality. At Woodland Park mulch, burn and tree-guarded
   treatments had greater height 1 and 6 years after planting. At year six
   tree-guarded treatments had lower mortality than other treatments. At
   Sorrell Springs height of E. nitens was greater than E. pauciflora at
   year one but not at year six. At Woodland Park height of E. nitens was
   generally greater at year six but having almost double the incidence of
   mortality relative to E. pauciflora. We conclude that expensive
   tree-guarding is only warranted where high browse pressure is expected
   and that on such sites species with tough leaves that are resistant to
   browsing should be considered. Further that in environments marginal for
   growing trees, best practice establishment technique is generally as
   effective as additional treatments of understorey nurse planting, spot
   burning or mulching.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus rotundata dominated peatbog (Zofinka Nature Reserve) in the Trebon
   Basin, Czech Republic, was affected by ``natural{''} disturbances: wind
   damage (1984), followed by a bark beetle attack, and fire (1994, 2000).
   Phytosociological releves were used to document vegetation. Soil water
   chemistry was compared in three differently affected stands: (1) an
   undisturbed Pinus rotundata bog forest, (2) a windthrow - bark beetle
   affected stand and (3) a site burned by wildfire in 2000. The species
   composition of the windthrow - bark beetle affected sites and the
   undisturbed P. rotundata bog forest differed mainly in the shrub and
   tree layers. Burned sites were partly colonized by anemochorous species
   (e. g. Taraxacum sp. div.) that disappeared within two or three years
   after colonization. Bare peat was colonized by bryophytes (e. g.
   Marchantia polymorpha and Funaria hygrometrica) typical of the disturbed
   sites, and by Polytrichum sp. div. and Aulacomnium palustre. Most plant
   species characteristic of the P. rotundata bog forest occurred at the
   burned sites eight years after the fire, but in different abundances.
   The edificator of the former community-P. rotundata-was mostly absent.
   Compared with windthrow followed by the bark beetle attack, fire
   promoted rapid expansion of Molinia caerulea. Soil water in both the
   undisturbed P. rotundata bog forest and the windthrow - bark beetle
   affected sites had a similar composition: very low pH values, high P
   concentrations, low concentrations of cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) and
   inorganic nitrogen. The concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus
   (SRP) and NH4+ - N were negatively correlated with the groundwater
   table. Total P, SRP and NH4+ - N concentrations in the soil water at the
   burned site were by one order of magnitude higher than those in the P.
   rotundata bog forest, while concentrations of K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were
   only about two times higher. High concentrations of P and N in the soil
   water found three years after the fire indicated a long-term elevated
   nutrient content in the soil water.}},

   propagule soil banks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{447-456}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Questions
   As changing wildfire regimes modify North American deserts, can fires of
   greater severity and frequency negatively impact the recovery of native
   bryophyte communities, which are not adapted to such disturbances? Does
   post-fire recovery result from the survival of existing surface plants,
   dormant propagules in sub-surface soil banks (dispersal in time) or
   aerial immigration into burned sites (dispersal in space)? Do wildfires
   negatively affect the survival of propagules in bryophyte soil banks?
   Location
   Continental arid shrublands, Mojave Desert, southwestern US.
   Methods
   We characterized bryophyte communities along a post-fire chronosequence
   spanning three decades across sites where fires had different
   severities, ages and potential fuels. Three community profiles (surface,
   soil and aerial) were surveyed with a combination of on-site surveys and
   emergence germination techniques. We tested for differences in beta
   diversity, species composition and richness with PERMDISP, PERMANOVA and
   linear mixed models, respectively.
   Results
   Burn severity was associated with differences in beta diversity, species
   composition and richness, while burn age was associated only with
   different composition and richness. No effect of potential fuel
   availability was found. More variation in composition was explained by
   significant differences among profiles than by other fire attributes.
   Species richness (but not beta diversity) was higher in soil profiles
   than in aerial spore rain or existing surface communities. Soils from
   the oldest and least severe burns had a greater number of species than
   soils from recent and more severe burns.
   Conclusions
   Bryophyte soil banks are common elements of desert soils that facilitate
   post-disturbance recovery of communities, but soil banks are themselves
   threatened by the intensifying frequency and severity of wildfires in
   North American deserts. Recovery of desert bryophyte communities seems
   to begin (but not necessarily conclude) within 30yr after wildfires. In
   the near future, communities may become perturbed from historical
   patterns as contemporary fire regimes undergo extensive changes.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forests are highly susceptible to wildfire, and post-fire changes
   in soil temperature and moisture have the potential to transform large
   areas of the landscape from a net sink to a net source of carbon (C).
   Understanding the ecological controls that regulate these disturbance
   effects is critical to developing models of ecosystem response to
   changes in fire frequency and severity. This paper combines laboratory
   and field measurements along a chronosequence of burned black spruce
   stands into regression analyses and models that assess relationships
   between moss succession, soil microclimate, decomposition, and C
   source-sink dynamics. Results indicate that post-fire changes in
   temperature and substrate quality increased decomposition in humic
   materials by a factor of 3.0 to 4.0 in the first 7 years after fire.
   Bryophyte species exhibited a distinct successional pattern in the first
   five decades after fire that corresponded to decreased soil temperature
   and increased C accumulation in organic soils. Potential rates of C
   exchange in mosses were greatest in early successional species and
   declined as the stand matured. Residual sources of CO2 (those not
   attributed to moss respiration or humic decomposition) increased as a
   function of stand age, reflecting increased contributions from roots as
   the stand recovered from disturbance. Together, the field measurements,
   laboratory experiments, and models provide strong evidence that
   interactions between moss and plant succession, soil temperature, and
   soil moisture largely regulate C source-sink dynamics from black spruce
   systems in the first century following fire disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the long-term impact of wildfire on the vegetation dynamics
   of sand grasslands in a forest-steppe vegetation mosaic in Central
   Hungary (Kiskunsag). Long-term permanent quadrat monitoring was carried
   out from 1997 to 2008. We sampled the forest-steppe mosaic both in burnt
   and unburnt areas in 100 patches altogether using 1 m x 1 m quadrats.
   The effect of fire and precipitation on vegetation dynamics was
   characterized by patch type transitions between years. Patch types were
   defined by means of Cocktail method. Nine patch types of sand grasslands
   were altogether identified. The least productive patch types, bare soil
   and cryptogam dominance, did not occur in the burnt patches, while
   annual dominated patch type appeared only in burnt patches. The
   frequencies of patch type changes were significantly higher in burnt
   patches than in unburnt ones, independently on time after fire. All the
   eight patch types found in the unburnt patches proved permanent, while
   in the burnt patches only four of seven were so. The relative frequency
   of patch type changes did not correlate with precipitation in the
   vegetation period in the unburnt patches, while positively correlated in
   the burnt patches. It was concluded that the long-term difference in
   grassland dynamics between the unburnt and burnt patches, i.e., the
   excess of the patch type transitions in the burnt grasslands, is due to
   increased drought sensitivity of the grassland, which is the consequence
   of the elimination of the woody component of the forest-steppe

Abstract = {{Every summer, wildfires affect thousands of steep watersheds in Italy,
   causing the partial or complete destruction of vegetation, and changes
   in soil hydraulic properties. Such effects alter the hydrologic response
   of watersheds, increasing post-fire debris and sediment-laden flow
   hazard. This study characterizes the most relevant predisposing and
   triggering factors for a sequence of four post-fire flooding events,
   which, in the late summer-autumn of 2017, affected Montoro village in
   southern Italy. This research work consists of a fire severity
   assessment based on multispectral satellite images, characterization of
   meteorological systems and related flood-triggering rainfall, and
   provides an overview of the damage that occurred in the repeatedly
   affected urban area using crowdsourced data. The research findings
   demonstrate that the analyzed area burned with moderate-high (64.4\%)
   and low severity (35.6\%) levels. All the flooding events were triggered
   by rainfall evaluated as non-extreme, but with relevant peak intensities
   (I-10 and I-30), associated with the first convective storms impacting
   the burned watersheds. The crowdsourced data highlight the fact that
   roads and buildings on footslopes were inundated by mud and debris
   transported by rapid flows. The study identifies a clear relationship
   between wildfires and flooding processes and provides useful information
   for hazard assessment and emergency management operations.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an ecological factor influencing the evolution and dynamics of
   the Mediterranean vegetation. To regenerate after fire, plants use two
   types of strategy: resprouting and germination of seeds. Among perennial
   species some are obligate seeders that need to produce flowers for the
   species to survive. How long does it take for a burnt plant,
   particularly those regenerating only by seeds and seedlings, to reach a
   size capable of producing flowers and then fruits? The study was carried
   out on a burnt and an unburnt area (as control) to determine the
   phenological flowering behaviour of plants in a wooded shrubland of
   Rosmarinus officinalis and Cistus monspeliensis. The flowering-set time
   was recorded in the 4 first years after fire, during 6 months each year.
   The highest numbers of flowering plants occurred in the first year after
   fire. This was principally due to the presence of many annuals. Most of
   the perennial species flowered in the year following fire. However,
   woody plants flowered later than herbaceous ones. Perennial obligate
   seeders flowered later (second and third years) than the majority of
   resprouters. By three years all the plants (observed flowering during
   the 4-year period) had set their first flowers; in the fourth year no
   further plants produced new flowers. In the fourth year, the numbers and
   percentages of flowering plants of the various biological traits were
   very similar in the burnt and unburnt vegetation. A comparison of
   flowering behaviour of the same species between burnt and unburnt areas
   did not indicate major differences in the phenological stages. Each
   species used its own type of strategy, resprouters and seeders coexisted
   in the communities and thus they can perpetuate the species in spite of
   repeated fire disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the structure of ground fuels, i.e. the moss and litter
   (M/L) layer, may be an important control on fire severity in heather
   moorlands and thus influence vegetation regeneration and soil carbon
   dynamics. We completed experimental fires in a Calluna
   vulgaris-dominated heathland to study the role of the M/L layer in
   determining (i) fire-induced temperature pulses into the soil and (ii)
   post-fire soil thermal dynamics. Manually removing the M/L. layer before
   burning increased fire-induced soil heating, both at the soil surface
   and 2 cm below. Burnt plots where the M/L layer was removed simulated
   the fuel structure after high severity fires where ground fuels are
   consumed but the soil does not ignite. Where the M/L layer was manually
   removed, either before or after the fire, post-fire soil thermal
   dynamics showed larger diurnal and seasonal variation, as well as
   similar patterns to those observed after wildfires, compared to burnt
   plots where the M/L layer was not manipulated. We used soil temperatures
   to explore potential changes in post-fire soil respiration. Simulated
   high fire severity (where the M/L layer was manually removed) increased
   estimates of soil respiration in warm months. With projected fire
   regimes shifting towards higher severity fires, our results can help
   land managers develop strategies to balance ecosystem services in

Abstract = {{Decreased fire activity has been recognized as a main cause of expansion
   and infilling of North American woodlands. Pinon-juniper
   (Pinus-Juniperus) woodlands in the western United States have expanded
   in area 2-10-fold since the late 1800s. Woodland control measures using
   chainsaws, heavy equipment and prescribed fire are used to restore big
   sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate Nutt.) steppe plant communities and
   reduce woody fuel loading. Immediate objectives in the initial control
   of Pinon-juniper are; (1) recovery of perennial herbaceous species to
   restore site composition, structure and processes (resilience) and
   resist invasion and dominance by invasive annual grasses (resistance)
   and (2) reducing woody fuel accumulations. Spanning a 7 year period
   (2006-2012), we compared herbaceous recovery following cutting and
   prescribed fire on three sites in mid and late succession western
   juniper (Juniperus occidentalis spp. occidentalis Hook.) woodlands in
   southeast Oregon. Treatments were untreated controls, partial cutting
   followed by fall broadcast burning (SEP), clear-cut and leave (CUT), and
   clear-cut and burn in winter (JAN), and spring (APR). Cover of
   herbaceous species was measured in three zones; interspace, litter mats
   around tree stumps (stump), and beneath felled trees. In interspace
   zones of all treatments, comprising between 51\% and 63\% of site areas,
   perennial bunchgrasses dominated two sites and co-dominated with
   invasive annual grasses at one site after treatment. Burning in the JAN
   treatments, when fuel moisture and relative humidity were high and
   temperatures cooler, reduced disturbance severity in stump and felled
   tree zones, which maintained perennial herbaceous understories and
   prevented or limited the presence of invasive annuals. Burning felled
   juniper in SEP and APR treatments resulted in moderate to high fire
   severity in stump and felled tree zones. At two sites, these fires
   consumed all fuel up to the 1000-h fuel class, largely eliminated
   herbaceous perennials, and created islands within treatments that
   enhanced annual grass invasion and dominance. To maintain or boost site
   resilience and resistance following control of late successional
   woodlands, reducing Pinon-juniper fuels by burning in winter provides
   managers with a low-impact option for conserving sagebrush steppe.

Abstract = {{After a long period in which fuel loads were sparse, fire recently has

   accidental fires that occurred during 1994-2003 (two in different years

   sites and matched spatial controls, and before and after the most recent
   fire. Herbaceous vegetation was sampled in multiple years producing a
   chronosequence of time since fire (from 4 months to 8 years). Riparian
   fire was associated with reductions in woody plant species diversity and
   canopy cover. In contrast, fire caused a short-term (2 year) pulse of
   herbaceous plant diversity, driven by annual species, and persistent
   increase in herbaceous cover. Path analysis indicated that the increase
   in herbaceous cover was mediated in part by the reduction in tree canopy
   cover. Ordination (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and regression
   analysis also indicated that canopy cover and/or fire played a role in
   structuring the herbaceous community, although its effects were
   secondary to that of hydrologic factors (stream flow rate, seasonal
   flood size). By converting riparian forests to grasslands and savannahs,
   fire may be shifting structure of the Upper San Pedro floodplain
   vegetation closer toward conditions present during past centuries when

Abstract = {{We used repeat oblique photography to quantify and determine the drivers

   the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, Canada, from the beginning of
   the twentieth century to the present. We classified the landscape into
   seven distinct vegetation types (closed-canopy conifer forest, broadleaf
   deciduous forest, mixedwood forest, open-canopy woodlands, shrublands,
   grasslands and meadows, non-vegetated) and assessed vegetation change
   between the two time periods. We found that closed-canopy coniferous
   forest, broadleaf deciduous forest, and mixedwood forest increased on an
   area basis by 35\%, 45\%, and 80\%, respectively, over this time period;
   concomitantly, grasslands and open-canopy woodlands declined by 25\% and
   39\%, respectively. Overall, 28\% of the landscape was in a more
   advanced successional state in 2008 as compared to the early twentieth
   century. The Montane and Subalpine Natural Subregions (NSR) experienced
   the most change (42\% and 26\%, respectively, in a more advanced
   successional state). The loss of open-canopy woodlands was observed
   across the entire landscape, while grassland and meadow losses were most
   acute in the Subalpine and Alpine NSRs. The probability of vegetation
   change to a more advanced successional condition was greater at higher
   elevations and in areas receiving lower amounts of solar insolation. The
   changes observed are consistent with what we would expect to see due to
   lengthening of fire return intervals. Understanding the magnitude of
   change in vegetation types and the drivers of this change is important
   for the development of effective contemporary ecosystem management and

Abstract = {{Questions: Do successional trajectories in plant diversity,
   heterogeneity and dominance respond differently to ungulate exclusion in
   unmanaged forests vs managed forests that are thinned and burned? Is
   vegetation in recently thinned and burned stands more sensitive to
   changes in the grazing regime?
   Location: Northeast OR, USA.
   Methods: We evaluated changes in plant community composition, diversity,
   heterogeneity and dominance under herbivory by multiple ungulates
   (cattle, elk, deer) vs ungulate exclusion at sites where trees were
   recently thinned and a prescribed burn was applied (managed), and in
   sites that were not thinned or burned in over 40 yr (unmanaged). Plant
   species diversity was calculated with the Simpsons index and richness as
   the total number of plant species. We estimated changes in plant
   community heterogeneity using a measure of taxonomic dissimilarity.
   Plant dominance was measured as the relative evenness among different
   plant functional groups (annual and perennial forbs and graminoids, and
   shrubs, subshrubs and trees).
   Results: As expected, managed sites displayed more early succession
   species, such as annual forbs and annual graminoids, while unmanaged
   sites were dominated by late-succession species such as shrubs,
   subshrubs and trees. Species richness, particularly of annuals, was
   strongly reduced when ungulates were excluded from managed sites, and to
   a lesser extent from unmanaged sites for some perennial plant species.
   Species diversity decreased to a slightly greater extent with ungulate
   exclusion at managed sites. Species dominance was not influenced by
   ungulate exclusion. The effect of ungulate exclusion on plant
   heterogeneity also depended on forest management. Heterogeneity
   increased at managed sites and decreased in unmanaged sites with
   ungulate exclusion. Overall, the change in vegetation composition over
   time increased with the exclusion of ungulates, particularly at managed
   sites.
   Conclusions: The strength and direction of specific vegetation and
   diversity responses to ungulate exclusion vary with forest management,
   and the influence of ungulate exclusion on plant succession is more
   pronounced in recently thinned and burned sites. Management of wild and
   domestic ungulates thus needs to account for forest management
   activities that alter vegetation seral stage and increase the
   sensitivity of vegetation to the ungulate grazing regime.}},

   replicable, scalable methods for modeling wildfire impacts on sediment
   and nonpoint source pollutant export into the nearshore environment, and
   assess relationships between wildfire severity and runoff. Nonpoint
   source pollutants were modeled using a GIS-based empirical deterministic
   model parameterized with multi-year land cover data to quantify
   fire-induced increases in transport to the nearshore environment.
   Results indicate post-fire concentration increases in phosphorus by 161
   percent, sediments by 350 percent and total suspended solids (TSS) by 53
   percent above pre-fire years. Higher wildfire severity was associated
   with the greater increase in exports of pollutants and sediment to the
   nearshore environment, primarily resulting from the conversion of forest
   and shrubland to grassland. This suggests that increasing wildfire
   severity with climate change will increase potential negative impacts to
   adjacent marine ecosystems. The approach used is replicable and can be
   utilized to assess the effects of other types of land cover change at
   landscape scales. It also provides a planning and prioritization
   framework for management activities associated with wildfire, including
   suppression, thinning, and post-fire rehabilitation, allowing for
   quantification of potential negative impacts to the nearshore
   environment in coastal basins. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Tropical savanna and forest are recognized to represent alternate stable
   states, primarily determined by feedbacks with fire. Vegetation-fire
   dynamics in each of these vegetation types are largely determined by the
   influence of the vegetation on fire behavior, as well as the effects of
   fire behavior on tree mortality, topkill (defined here as complete death
   of the aerial biomass, regardless of whether the plant recovers by
   resprouting), and rate of growth of resprouts. We studied the effect of
   fire on three savanna-forest boundaries in central Brazil. Fire
   intensity was greater in savanna than forest, as inferred by a twofold
   greater height of stem charring. Despite lower. re intensity, forest
   tree species exhibited higher rates of topkill, which was best explained
   by their thinner bark, relative to savanna species. Following topkill,
   there was no tendency for sprouts of savanna trees to grow faster than
   those of forest species, contrary to expectations, nor was whole-plant
   mortality higher in forest than in savanna. This contrasts with
   observations of high rates of postburn mortality in many other tropical
   forests. The low tree mortality in these transitional forests suggests
   that the dynamic of these natural savanna-forest boundaries is
   fundamentally different from that of forest boundaries originating from
   deforestation in the humid tropics. The forests studied here appear to
   be much more resilient to occasional incursion of. re from the savanna,
   despite being unable to invade frequently burned savanna. The thin bark
   of forest species makes them particularly susceptible to the ``fire
   trap,{''} whereby repeated topkill of small trees prevents recruitment
   into adult size classes. Rapid growth will be particularly important for
   forest species to escape the fire trap, so we predict that, where fire
   is frequent, forests should be restricted to high-resource sites. Here,
   Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations had particularly strong effects on postburn
   growth rates, suggesting that these elements may most strongly limit the
   distribution of forest in these fire-prone savannas.}},

   resulted in basal areas within the historical range of variability (HRV)
   in low-severity sites that were initially dominated by smaller diameter
   trees; but in sites initially dominated by larger trees, the range was
   consistently exceeded. For high-severity sites, prescribed fire was too
   frequent to reach the HRV's minimum basal area. Alternatively, for all
   stands under milder scenarios, uneven-aged management resulted in basal
   areas within the HRV because of its inherent flexibility to manipulate

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{The trajectory and recovery time of fire-disturbed forests depend on the
   capacity of seedlings and resprouts to get established over time. Here,
   we investigated the mechanisms associated with fire effects on post-fire
   regeneration in the context of a large-scale fire experiment located in
   southeastern Amazonia. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that
   recurrent understory fires reduce forest regeneration capacity by
   reducing the recruitment of seedlings, the viability of the soil seed
   bank, the seed rain, and the resprouts. The experiment was comprised of
   three 50-ha plots: an unburned control, and two plots that were
   experimentally burned three (triennially) or six (annually) times
   between 2004 and 2010. Seedlings represented 2.4 and 0.6\% of the seed
   rain and soil seed bank in the Control and burned treatment plots,
   respectively. Compared to the control, the triennial burns caused more
   reduction than the annual ones in seed rain (-42 vs. -10\%) and seed
   bank (-78 vs. -50\%). These fire-related reduction in seed rain in both
   treatments explain most of the low post-fire density of seedlings (0.4
   and 0.8 ind/m(2), respectively), compared with the Control (2.9
   ind/m(2)). The 3-year interval between fires contributed to highest
   mortality of seeds stored in the soil than in the annual burn treatment,
   where fires were less severe. However, there were 5.5 times more
   resprouting in the plot burned triennially compared with the one burned
   annually. In both treatments, though, the number of resprouts declined
   over time. In conclusion, seeds from both seed rain and seed bank and
   resprouting were negatively affected by both fire frequencies, reducing
   the likelihood of native species recovery by altering the regeneration
   pathways. This situation is expected to be increasingly common in
   southeastern Amazon forests, particularly under warmer and dryer climate
   conditions.}},

   A. leiocalyx showed higher symbiotic N-2 fixation and photosynthetic

Abstract = {{Fire is one of the most important ecological factors for many ecosystem

   aimed to study long-term changes in beetle community structure after
   fire in Pinus brutia Ten. forests. Five sites burned in different years
   and a control site unburned for at least 50 years were selected. Beetle
   sampling was conducted using four pit-fall traps in each of four
   transects in three replication plots at every successional site and in
   two plots at the control site. Microhabitat variables related to
   vegetation structure and litter layer were recorded and associated with
   abundances of beetles and feeding groups. The results showed that total,
   wood-eating, and predator beetles showed a decreasing trend of abundance
   along the successional gradient after fire. In contrast to these groups,
   herbivores tended to increase towards the late successional stages.
   Middle and late successional stages were important in terms of species
   richness, species diversity and evenness of beetle communities and
   feeding groups. The characteristics of vegetation and litter layer
   changed with successional gradient, playing a decisive role in the
   structure of beetle communities at successional sites. According to the

Abstract = {{In this study, we compared the effectiveness of two treatments, straw
   mulching (2.3 Mg ha(-1)) and seeding (4 g m(-2)), in reducing soil
   erosion after an experimental fire in a gorse (Ulex europaeus L.)
   shrubland. Straw mulch provided an initial ground cover of 87\%. The
   maximum temperature reached at the mineral soil surface during fire was
   positively related to accumulated sediment yield during the first year
   after fire, supporting the importance of soil heating (or its surrogate,
   soil burn severity) to explain post-fire erosion. The first year after
   fire only straw mulch application significantly reduced soil erosion
   relative to the untreated burned soils (89\%). Seeding did not affect
   soil erosion after fire. The mean sediment yield after the seeding
   treatment (2.9 Mg ha(-1)) was similar to that in the untreated burned
   plots (3.6 Mg ha(-1)). Maximum concentrated precipitation (rainfall > 20
   mm accumulated in one or two consecutive days) and antecedent soil
   moisture were the variables most strongly associated with soil losses in
   the untreated burned and seeded soils. Rainfall intensity-related
   variables did not explain soil loss variability. In the mulched soil,
   only the maximum concentrated rainfall was related to sediment yield.
   Total vegetation cover recovery was quite fast, particularly between 6
   and 12 months after fire, and 70\% of the ground was covered by the end
   of the study. However, when the erosion rate was maximal, the cover
   provided by vegetation was very low. Seeding contribution to total
   vegetation cover was small and we did not find any differences in the
   mean vegetation cover between treatments although mulching delayed
   vegetation cover recovery slightly. In summary, seeding failed to reduce
   soil loss after fire, and the cover, directly in contact with the ground
   was a key factor in reducing post-fire soil loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Fire is known to facilitate the invasion of many non-native plant
   species, but how invasion into burnt areas varies along environmental
   gradients is not well-understood. We used two pre-existing data sets to
   analyse patterns of invasion by non-native plant species into burnt
   areas along gradients of topography, soil and vegetation structure in
   Yosemite National Park, California, USA. A total of 46 non-native
   species (all herbaceous) were recorded in the two data sets. They
   occurred in all seven of the major plant formations in the park, but
   were least common in subalpine and upper montane conifer forests. There
   was no significant difference in species richness or cover of
   non-natives between burnt and unburnt areas for either data set, and
   environmental gradients had a stronger effect on patterns of non-native
   species distribution, abundance and species composition than burning.
   Cover and species richness of non-natives had significant positive
   correlations with slope (steepness) and herbaceous cover, while species
   richness had significant negative correlations with elevation, the
   number of years post-burn, and cover of woody vegetation. Non-native
   species comprised a relatively minor component of the vegetation in both
   burnt and unburnt areas in Yosemite (percentage species = 4\%, mean
   cover < 6.0\%), and those species that did occur in burnt areas tended
   not to persist over time. The results indicate that in many western
   montane ecosystems, fire alone will not necessarily result in increased
   rates of invasion into burnt areas. However, it would be premature to
   conclude that non-native species could not affect post-fire succession
   patterns in these systems. Short fire-return intervals and high fire
   severity coupled with increased propagule pressure from areas used
   heavily by humans could still lead to high rates of invasion,
   establishment and spread even in highly protected areas such as
   Yosemite.}},

   Within a 0.87 ha clearcut area with four 10 m x 10 m sampling plots, two

   The results showed that the species diversity, basal area and density of

   types, while they were not significantly different between the burned

   dominate the secondary forest with a broad height distribution.
   The structural complexity and high tree species diversity of the

Abstract = {{Restoration of areas used for intensive even-aged Norway spruce (Picea
   abies Karst.) plantations often involves felling and subsequent
   spontaneous vegetation succession. However, the accumulated litter layer
   may hamper vegetation development, and thereby postpone recovery or even
   change the outcome.
   We studied effects of the litter layer on vegetation establishment
   during two seasons following a clear-cut of Norway spruce in Denmark. We
   experimentally assessed the response of multiple vegetation properties
   to litter removal, with and without wildlife exclusion by fencing, and
   in combination with sowing of trees, while fencing. Burning was tested
   as an alternative way to remove the litter layer.
   Vegetation establishment was poor, when the litter layer was intact, and
   cover developed slowly remaining below 10\% after two years,
   irrespective of fencing. In contrast, litter removal and fencing
   together gave significantly faster recovery and reached nearly 60\% mean
   cover. Vegetation cover was driven by few dominant species, especially
   the sedge Carex pilulifera. Species richness was similar in all
   treatments, but increased with sowing of trees. Fencing resulted in
   taller birch seedlings independently of litter removal, but enhanced by
   seedling density. Litter removal seemed to favor species with lighter
   seeds, lower specific leaf area (SLA) and lower Ellenberg N value, i.e.
   associated with relative infertile conditions. Disturbing the litter by
   burning seemed to have an effect comparable to mechanical removal, and
   could be a management alternative.
   Our results showed that a persistent litter layer after spruce
   plantation removal may hamper the initial vegetation establishment.
   Actively removing litter may serve as an additional restoration
   intervention to overcome this legacy. However, as grazing can keep this
   potential in check, wildlife exclusion may be necessary as well. To
   speed up recovery and diversify vegetation structure after spruce
   plantation removal, we suggest patchy disturbance of the litter,
   essentially combined with wildlife exclusion. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fur

Title = {{Determinants of composition, diversity and structure in a seasonally dry
   forest in Myanmar}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Seasonally dry forest with a deciduous canopy is a widespread ecosystem
   in Southeast Asia. Debate continues about whether this vegetation is
   forest or savanna. Savannas have tree cover <60\%, C-4-dominated ground
   vegetation, and frequent fires. Forests have tree cover >70\%,
   C-3-dominated ground vegetation, and infrequent fires. We studied three
   community types previously identified in seasonally dry forests in
   Myanmar, High Indaing, Low Indaing (both types of deciduous
   Dipterocarp-dominated forest) and Mixed Deciduous Forest (usually
   dominated by non-Dipterocarp species). We wanted to know whether their
   herbaceous layer communities were also compositionally distinctive,
   whether their structure (\% tree cover, C-4 abundance) identified them
   as savannas or forests, and whether they differed with respect to soil
   nutrients, and fire frequency.
   We sampled fifteen 50 m x 50 m plots thought to represent the 3
   community types (5 plots of each community type). In each plot we
   measured basal area, abundance and richness of trees with DBH >= 5 cm,
   and percentage cover, abundance and richness of herbaceous layer
   species, and classified each species as C-3/C-4. We estimated tree cover
   along four 50 m line transects recording canopy openness/closure every 1
   m. We pooled six 0-15 cm soil cores to estimate soil parameters (N, P,
   K, pH). We recorded fire frequency in each plot using MODIS fire
   products for 2001-2017.
   We found that tree, herbaceous-layer and combined compositional data
   generated similar community clusters. Low Indaing had open tree canopies
   and high abundance of C-4 plants relative to Mixed Deciduous Forest.
   High Indaing had a wider range of tree covers but also high C-4
   abundance. Fire was common in all three communities. Low Indaing could
   be differentiated from Mixed Deciduous forest by soil K and P (lower for
   Low Indaing), with High Indaing having intermediate values.
   Low Indaing appears to be a type of savanna whereas Mixed Deciduous
   Forest is a type of forest, but with the propensity to burn. In our
   data, High Indaing showed characteristics of both savanna and forest.
   Although soils underlie the transitions between these Asian communities,
   they do not show the clear physiognomic boundaries observed in African
   and South American savanna-forest transitions. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Large forest fires have recently increased in frequency and severity in
   many ecosystems. Due to the heterogeneity in fuels, weather and
   topography, these large fires tend to form unburned islands of
   vegetation. This study focuses on a large forest fire that occurred in
   north-eastern Spain in 1998, which left large areas of unburned
   vegetation within its perimeter. Based on a satellite post-fire severity
   map we searched for the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors
   leading to unburned island formation. We divided the area of the fire
   into individual units we called ``slopes{''} which were meant to
   separate the differential microclimatic effects of contrasted aspects.
   The number of unburned islands and their areas were related to 12
   variables that influence their formation (i.e. land cover composition,
   aspect, steepness, forest structure, two landscape indices and weather
   variables). We hypothesized that unburned vegetation islands would
   concentrate on northern aspects, in less flammable forests (i.e.
   broadleaf species) and higher fragmentation to interrupt the advance of
   fire. While north and western aspects did have a higher presence of
   unburned vegetation islands, our study suggests greater presence of
   islands in slopes that are larger (i.e. more continuous areas with
   relatively homogeneous aspect), with greater proportions of forest
   cover, with higher wood volumes and with lower proportions of broadleaf
   species. Climate also played a role, with relative humidity and wind
   speed positively and negatively correlated to island formation,
   respectively. Unburned vegetation was more frequent on slopes with lower
   diversity of land covers and higher dominance of one land cover in the
   slope. Since slopes with only one land cover (i.e. forests) had more
   islands than slopes with multiple cover types, we infer that under
   severe meteorological conditions, fragmented forests can be more
   affected by wind and by water stress, thus burning more readily than
   forests that are protected from this edge phenomenon. These results
   would reinforce forest management strategies that avoid linear features
   (fire-lines and fire-breaks), to enhance fuel treatments that focus on
   areas and minimize fragmentation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla-Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands are
   expanding into shrubsteppe ecosystems in western portions of the Great
   Basin. Often, highly competitive trees displace the understory, and
   prescribed fire is increasingly use(] as a restoration tool. To inform
   management decisions about post-fire recovery, we examined immediate and
   long-term (i.e., 2 growing seasons) responses of the germinable seed
   bank to a spring prescribed fire. One week before and 1 week after a May
   2002 prescribed burn, soil samples were taken tinder P. monophylla
   trees, under Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana shrubs, and from
   interspace microsites. Two growing seasons after the prescribed burn,
   soil samples were taken from the same microsites and from similar
   microsites in an adjacent unburned area. Prior to the burn, the
   germinable seed bank tinder shrubs contained the highest seed density
   and the highest species richness followed by interspace and tree
   microsites. Shrub litter was consumed by the burn, causing complete loss
   of the seed bank front that microsite and depleting the A. tridentata
   seed bank. Interestingly, the density of germinable seeds in soil tinder
   P monophylla trees increased immediately following the burn; 70\% of
   that increase originated from the annual forb Descurainia pinnata. Two
   growing seasons following the prescribed burn, no overall differences in
   germinable seed density between burned and unburned plots were observed,
   but seed bank species composition differed, with seed banks in the
   prescribed burn having a greater abundance of Eriogonum elatum, E.
   microthecum, and Gayophytum diffusion compared to unburned plots, which
   had a greater abundance of A. tridentata, Lappula occidentalis, and
   Descurainia pinnata. Our results indicate that rapid restoration to
   prefire vegetation cannot rely upon the soil seed bank. To ensure rapid
   recovery, land managers should select sites for prescribed burns that

   and a long-term post-fire interval from 2009 to 2010. In addition, we
   measured the annual reproductive output of eggs each year and monitored
   the body condition of tortoises over time. One adult female tortoise was
   killed by the fire and five tortoises bore exposure scars that were not
   fatal. Despite predictions that tortoises would make the short-distance
   movements from burned to nearby unburned habitats, most activity areas
   and their centroids remained in burned areas for the duration of the

   strong, but performance varied considerably among species and sites. The

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{190-200}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Question: The role edges play in mediating the effects of disturbance is
   unclear. Bayhead tree islands, which experience above- and belowground
   fire, contain trees that recover from disturbance by seed (Pinus
   elliottii var. densa) and by sprouting (Gordonia lasianthus). How does
   distance-to-edge affect survival and post-fire response of trees with
   these contrasting life-history strategies?
   Location: Two bayhead tree islands at Archbold Biological Station,
   central Florida, North America.
   Methods: Stem diameter, depth of peat smoldering, char height,
   resprouting status, and location were recorded for all Pinus and
   Gordonia stems >= 8 cm. Distance to the edge of the tree island was
   quantified using GIS.
   Results: The focal species showed contrasting patterns of survival
   across the edge-to-interior gradient that reflected gradients of fire
   severity. Survival of Gordonia was lowest in the bayhead interior where
   peat smolder was deepest. Conversely, survival of Pinus was lowest near
   the edges where char heights were greatest. The distinct types of
   Gordonia resprouting (crown versus basal) also showed spatially
   contrasting patterns. Basal resprouting dominated near the edges and was
   positively influenced by char height, while crown resprouting was nearly
   constant across the edge-to-interior gradient and was negatively
   influenced by char height.
   Conclusions: The spatial patterns of tree survival and resprouting
   observed are likely due to gradients in intensity of peat smoldering and
   aboveground burning, coupled with differential susceptibility to these
   two types of fire. Despite the rarity of fire in wetland tree islands
   (compared to uplands) it may play an important role in structuring the
   spatial distribution of trees.}},

Abstract = {{Germination responses of species from the native plant communities of
   south-western Western Australia can be related to syndromes of life
   history, fire response, and seed storage, and also to factors related to
   environmental stress. The Mediterranean-type climate of the region with
   periodic drought and recurrent fires affects the production of viable
   seeds in plants of limited stature and rooting depth. Fire response
   ephemerals and species cued to flower by fire tend to produce viable,
   readily germinable seeds, but there are instances where seed production
   is aborted in these predominantly herbaceous life forms. Clonal,
   rhizomatous species often produce mainly inviable seeds. Production of
   viable seeds in woody species of these highly diverse communities may
   also be restricted by limitations to cross pollination. Obligate
   post-fire seeding species tend to produce a greater proportion of viable
   seeds than species which are capable of resprouting following fire.
   Serotinous species, whether post-fire re-seeders or post-fire
   resprouting species, produce mainly viable seeds, which germinate
   readily once freed from protective fruits. Species of the legume
   families and a few others of the soil seed bank produce innately dormant
   seeds which can be germinated following heat shock treatments which
   simulate the effects of fire. Heat shock in these species appears mainly
   as a mechanism to crack the hard seed coats, but the effect of heat to
   denature seed coat inhibitors has not been eliminated. Western
   Australian species do not seem to break dormancy when exposed to
   leachates from burned wood as has been observed in comparable habitats
   in California and South Africa, but further research is advised.
   Germination in many native south-western Australian species is cued by
   temperatures that correspond to the winter rainfall period. There are
   also indications that an after-ripening period of warm, dry storage
   increases percentage of germinable seeds. Stimulation of germination by
   hormones is almost unresearched in Western Australia, but germination
   percentages have been increased in a small number of species of
   horticultural potential. Stimulation of germination by soil nutrient
   concentrations is almost unresearched in Western Australia, except for
   the inhibitory effect of excess sodium chloride levels in Eucalyptus and
   Melaleuca. These species only germinate when osmotic effects are reduced
   to lower levels as would occur when winter rains dilute soil salts.
   Application of research on seed germination has already enhanced the
   establishment of seedlings in the restoration of mine sites and is
   becoming important in aspects of the breeding and selection of native
   plants for the cut flower, bedding plant and essential oil industries.}},

   focus on taxonomic richness, diversity, and cover of ground flora in
   post-agricultural Pinus-hardwood stands on the Cumberland Plateau in
   Alabama, USA. This paper reports on one year of post-treatment data (two
   years post burn) within a longer-term study of thinning and repeated
   burns. Overstory basal area and density were lower with increased
   management intensity. Sapling density was substantially greater with
   increased management intensity; however, this did not affect ground
   flora richness, diversity, or cover. Ground flora richness, diversity,
   and cover were greatest in stands that were thinned and burned every
   three years, and these measures were negatively correlated with litter
   depth and positively correlated with exposed mineral soil in a
   non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) solution. Our results signify
   the need for a combination of thinning and burning in these systems.
   Forest managers that wish to promote native plant diversity in similar
   systems may consider thinning and frequent burning to increase light
   availability, decrease litter depth, and promote ground flora richness,
   diversity, and cover.}},

Abstract = {{After a wildfire the soil is covered by ash. Ash properties depend on
   vegetation type, amount of fuel and fire intensity. The ash layer
   controls the post-fire soil hydrologic response, but little is known
   about the effect of ash thickness and ash type on infiltration, which is
   relevant for post-fire runoff and soil losses and for ecosystems
   rehabilitation and restoration. This paper analyses the role of i) ash
   type (black or white), ii) thickness (5, 15 and 30 mm-thick) and iii)
   temporal variation (0, 15 and 40 days) under three simulated rain events
   (55 mm for 1 h) on soil surface hydrology. The rainfall was simulated on
   025 m(2) plots, and time to ponding, runoff and runoff discharge were
   measured. The infiltration rates, the initial infiltration rate (f(0)),
   the steady-state infiltration rate (f(c)), and the infiltration decay
   factor (k), were calculated and the Horton infiltration equation
   applied. The results show that soils covered with white ash doubled the
   runoff rates of soils covered with black ash. In general, runoff
   decreases as the ash thickness increases and the runoff decreases with
   the number of rainfall events after the fire in plots covered with white
   ash. Ponding time and k are positively correlated by the ash thickness
   and f(0) and f(c) are correlated by the rainfall events (in three runs).

   approximately 10 years after an initial chronosequence survey, enabling
   an extension of the chronosequence to cover a longer fire-free interval

   time since fire across the 14 sites. However, only diversity (H) and
   evenness (E) decreased within sites as predicted in the original
   chronosequence study. No decrease in species richness within sites was
   observed. The chronosequence correctly predicted changes in species
   abundance but not the number of species present. Tree cover also
   increased, suggesting that the heathland was becoming a woodland in the
   long-term absence of fire. Fire history, which is an uncontrolled

Abstract = {{Wildfires and prescribed fires cause a range of impacts on forest soils
   depending on the interactions of a nexus of fire severity, scale of
   fire, slope, infiltration rates, and post-fire rainfall. These factors
   determine the degree of impact on forest soils and subsequently the need
   for post-fire soil management. Fire is a useful tool in landscape
   management but it can be benign or set off serious deteriorations in
   soil quality that lead to long-term desertification. If parts of the
   nexus are absent or not inherently risky, forest soil impacts can be
   relatively minor or nonexistent. A low severity prescribed fire on a
   small landscape unit with minimal fuel loading, slopes less than 10\%,
   and no water repellency is unlikely to damage soil condition and
   functions with all but heavy rainfall. On the other hand, a high
   severity wildfire in a substantial area of heavy fuels with slopes
   >100\% and water repellency may undergo serious soil damage with even
   moderate rainfall. Soil management is not likely to be needed in the
   former case but virtually impossible in the latter scenario. This paper
   examines thresholds in the nexus factors which can raise the risks of

Abstract = {{Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait) is a very important timber-producing
   species in Portugal with a yield of similar to 67.1 million m(3)
   year(-1). It covers similar to 22.6 per cent of the forest area (710.6 x
   10(3) ha). Fire is the most significant threat to maritime pine
   plantations. This paper discusses research aiming at the development of
   post-fire mortality models for P. pinaster Ait stands in Portugal that
   can be used for enhanced integration of forest and fire management
   planning activities. Post-fire mortality was modelled using biometric
   and fire data from 2005/2006 National Forest Inventory plots and other
   sample plots within 2006-2008 fire perimeters. A three-step modelling
   strategy based on logistic regression methods was used. Firstly, the
   probability of mortality to occur after a wildfire in a stand is
   predicted and secondly, the degree of mortality caused by a wildfire on
   stands where mortality occurs is quantified. Thirdly, mortality is
   distributed among trees. The models are based on easily measurable tree
   characteristics so that forest managers may predict post-fire mortality
   based on forest structure. The models show that relative mortality
   decreases when average d.b.h. increases, while slope and tree size
   diversity increase the mortality.}},

   semiarid woodland}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Oaks (Quercus spp.) are currently declining worldwide due to a multitude
   of threats. Woodland management is often heavily focused on thinning and
   burning nontarget species to reduce competition and promote oak
   dominance in the overstory. These techniques have typically been
   developed in temperate regions, such as eastern U.S. forests, but
   whether they are the most effective strategy for promoting oak
   regeneration in semiarid woodlands has not been sufficiently examined.
   We conducted our study on the eastern Edwards Plateau in central Texas,
   where several oak species are codominant with Ashe juniper (Juniperus
   ashei) over karst limestone terrane. These juniper-oak woodlands provide
   habitat for many endemic species and play an essential role in the
   maintenance of key aquifers. A history of canopy clearing and a severe
   drought in 2011 generated patches of living and dead juniper-oak canopy
   interspersed with canopy gaps in our study area. In November 2013, we
   planted 200 shin oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba) acorns in each of
   three habitat treatments, replicated six times: (1) live canopy, (2)
   dead canopy, and (3) open invasive grassland. We monitored emergence and
   survival each year, harvesting five seedlings from each replicate in
   October 2017 to assess shoot height, rooting depth, biomass,
   ectomycorrhizal colonization, and foliar nutrients. Canopy trees, living
   or dead, significantly enhanced seedling emergence and survival.
   Survival was positively associated with increasing Ashe juniper and oak
   basal area, shrub cover, and soil organic matter, and negatively
   associated with increasing canopy gap size (complete mortality in gaps
   >220 m(2)). Seedling biomass increased significantly in dead and open
   treatments along with foliar nutrients N, P, and S (dead treatments) or
   S and Fe (open treatments), whereas ectomycorrhizal colonization and
   foliar nutrients Ca, Mg, and Mn increased under living canopy. Our
   findings suggest that oak regeneration in these juniper-oak woodlands
   closely resembles that of Mediterranean regions, where canopy
   facilitates seedling survival. Both living and dead trees and shrubs
   enhanced oak regeneration, with seedling survival depending on proximity
   to larger trees, living roots, shrubs, and juniper-oak canopy. Planting
   acorns under canopy is an inexpensive, sustainable, and effective
   restoration practice in drought-prone ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of different logging techniques on nutrient losses in burnt
   eucalyptus and pine forests in northern Portugal was investigated. A
   variety of logging techniques is used in the region resulting in varying
   amounts of slash debris on the slopes. The efficacy of this litter in
   reducing soil erosion is well established but less is known about the
   impact on nutrient losses. Small bounded plots were used to examine the
   impact of varying amounts of slash debris and pine-needle cover on
   nutrient losses in overland flow and adsorbed to eroded sediment over 19
   months during the first two-three years after fire. Nutrient losses in
   solution and adsorbed to eroded sediment were substantially higher on
   burnt terrain due to increased erosion and overland flow generation and
   high nutrient concentrations at the soil surface in the burned forests.
   Post-fire logging techniques in eucalyptus forests resulting in large
   amounts of litter debris on the slopes are effective at reducing eroded
   sediment nutrient losses but less effective at reducing losses in
   solution. In pine forests, litter is largely ineffective in reducing
   solute and sediment nutrient losses. However, a covering of pine needles
   was shown to be highly effective in reducing eroded sediment nutrient
   losses and to a lesser extent solute losses. Conservational methods of
   logging are suggested for both eucalyptus and pine forests in the
   region. In the absence of such measures, the sustainability of
   short-rotation eucalyptus forestry is questioned in northern Portugal.

Abstract = {{Wildfire usually promotes Hooding and accelerated erosion in upland
   watersheds. In the summer of 1999, a high-severity wildfire burned a
   series of mixed pine/oak headwater catchments in the San Jacinto
   Mountains of southern California. Log erosion barriers (LEBs) were
   constructed across much of the burned area as an erosion control
   measure. We built debris basins in two watersheds, each about I ha in
   area, one with LEBs, the other without, to measure post-fire hydrologic
   response and sediment yield and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   LEBs. The watersheds are underlain by granitic bedrock, producing a
   loamy sand soil above large extents of weathered bedrock and exposed
   core stones (tors) on the surface. Measured soil water-repellency was
   similar over the two catchments. Rain gauges measured 348 mm of
   precipitation in the first post-fire year. The ephemeral stream channels
   experienced surface flow after major rainstorms. and the source of the
   water was throughflow exfiltration at the slope/channel interface.
   Post-fire overland flow produced some rilling, but hillslope erosion
   measured in silt fences away from any LEBs was minor, as was sediment
   accumulation behind the LEBs. Stream channels in the catchments
   exhibited minor net scour. Water yield was much greater in the
   LEB-treated watershed. This resulted in 14 times more sediment yield by
   weight than the untreated watershed. Average soil depths determined by
   augering were nearly double in the catchment without the LEBs compared
   with the treated watershed. This suggests that differences in water and
   sediment yield between the two catchments are due to the twofold
   difference in the estimated soil water-holding capacity in the untreated
   watershed. It appears that the deeper soils in the untreated watershed
   were able to retain most of the precipitation, releasing less Water to
   the channels and thereby reducing erosion and sediment yield. Thus, the
   test of LEB effectiveness was inconclusive in this study, because soil
   depth and soil water-holding capacity may have masked their performance.

Abstract = {{We characterised the remarkable heterogeneity following the large,
   severe fires of 1988 in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), in the northern
   Rocky Mountains, Wyoming, USA, by focussing on spatial variation in
   post-fire structure, composition and ecosystem function at broad, meso,
   and fine scales. Ecological heterogeneity at multiple scales may enhance
   resilience to large, severe disturbances by providing structural,
   biological and functional redundancy. Post-fire heterogeneity in stand
   age, coarse wood abundance, microbial and understorey communities
   reflected interactions between existing pre-fire patterns and fire
   severity at different scales, suggesting that environmental context
   plays an important role in successional responses to large fires. In
   response to these post-fire patterns, heterogeneity in carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) storage, N mineralisation, decomposition, and productivity
   was also evident at multiple scales and may confer resiliency to large
   fires. For example, at broad scales, C storage in YNP appears resistant
   to changes in age-class structure associated with large stand-replacing
   fires. In summary, the YNP landscape is recovering rapidly from the 1988
   fires through natural mechanisms, owing to the abundance and spatial
   heterogeneity of post-fire residuals, but other systems with fewer
   biotic legacies may be less resilient to such large, severe fires.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire has been shown to increase erosion by several orders Of
   magnitude, but knowledge regarding short-term variations in post-fire
   sediment transport processes has been lacking. We present a detailed
   analysis of the immediate post-fire sediment dynamics in a semi-arid
   basin in the Southwestern USA based on suspended sediment rating curves.
   During June and July 2003, the Aspen Fire in the Coronado National
   Forest of southern Arizona burned an area of 343 km(2). Surface water
   samples were collected in an affected watershed using an event-based
   sampling strategy. Sediment rating parameters were determined for
   individual storm events during, the first 18 months after the fire. The
   highest sediment concentrations were observed immediately after the
   tire. Through the two subsequent monsoon seasons there was a progressive
   change in rating parameters related to the preferential removal of fine
   to coarse sediment. During the corresponding winter seasons, there was a
   lower supply of sediment from the hillslopes, resulting in a
   time-invariant set of sediment rating parameters. A sediment
   mass-balance model corroborated the physical interpretation. The
   temporal variability in the sediment rating parameters demonstrates the
   importance of storm-based sampling in areas with intense monsoon
   activity to characterize post-fire sediment transport accurately. In
   particular, recovery of rating parameters depends on the number of
   high-intensity rainstorms. These findings can be used to constrain rapid
   assessment fire-response models for planning mitigation activities.

Abstract = {{A century of fire suppression has left fire-dependent forests of the
   western United States increasingly vulnerable to wildfire, drought, and
   insects. Forest managers are trying to improve resilience using
   treatments such as mechanical thinning and prescribed fire; however,
   operational and resource constraints limit treatments to a fraction of
   the needed area each year. An alternative is to let wildfires burn under
   less-than-extreme fire weather where human lives and infrastructure are
   not at risk. We examined post-fire forest structure using airborne lidar
   data to determine whether a single wildland fire following an extended
   fire-free period could produce forest structures resembling
   fire-resilient historical conditions. We studied forest structures
   resulting from these ``first-entry{''} fires in a forest with a history
   of timber management (2008 American River Complex Fires, Tahoe National
   Forest) and in a wilderness area (2009 Big Meadow Fire, Yosemite
   National Park). We compared the results of these first-entry fires with
   nearby reference areas that had experienced 2+ fires that burned
   predominately at low- and moderate-severity. We identified visible
   overstory trees from the lidar data and examined their patterns in terms
   of individuals, tree clumps, and openings. We found that
   moderate-severity fire effects in these first-entry fires produced
   similar patterns to the reference areas with area in openings at
   approximately 40\% and trees predominately in small (2 to 4 trees) and
   medium (5-9 trees) clumps High-severity fire produced mortality likely
   to lead to large canopy openings that were historically uncharacteristic
   in these forests. As burn severity increased, the amount of the residual
   canopy area represented by taller trees ( > 16 m and especially > 32 m)
   decreased, which could result from fires preferentially killing taller
   trees or from locations with taller trees more commonly experiencing
   lower burn severities. Our study suggests that first-entry fires allowed
   to burn under less-than-extreme conditions can reproduce spatial
   patterns resembling historical conditions resilient to fires and drought
   but possibly at the disproportionate expense of larger trees.}},

Abstract = {{Projections are that the area of planted stands of southern pines will
   exceed 50 million ac (20 million hectares) by 2060; most will be managed
   primarily for timber and fiber production using rotations less than
   three decades in length. This has been a tremendous silvicultural
   success. However, weighing against that success is the associated
   decline of native fire-adapted ecosystems dominated by longleaf pine
   (Pinus palustris L.) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.), and the
   flora and fauna adapted to open woodland habitats. Three elements of
   silvicultural practice will be needed to recover these ecosystems.
   First, on sites where longleaf pine or shortleaf pine no longer exist
   but to which they are adapted, planting will be a primary tool to
   re-establish those species. Second, the reintroduction of fire in stands
   and landscapes through prescribed burning will also be important, but
   will be difficult to integrate into operational management. Third, there
   are silvicultural opportunities in natural stands with a minor component
   of either longleaf pine or shortleaf pine by using reproduction cuffing
   or thinning, prescribed burning, and release treatments to bring those
   species back to dominance. Efforts are under way, especially on National
   Forest lands, to recover longleaf and shortleaf pine ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{As major disturbance agents, natural catastrophes impact habitats,
   thereby maintaining the dynamics of ecological communities. Such
   discrete events are expected to positively affect biodiversity because
   they generate high habitat heterogeneity and thus numerous ecological
   niche opportunities. Species typical of open and semi-open habitats,
   which are often of high conservation concern in modern anthropized
   landscapes, may benefit most from recurrent natural catastrophes that
   regularly reset ecosystems. We investigated bird community changes and
   species-specific responses to wildfire at two recently burnt temperate,
   montane-subalpine forest stands in an inner-Alpine Swiss valley, with a
   special focus on red-listed and conservation priority species. We
   compared bird community changes in burnt forests (spanning 13 years)
   with bird assemblages occurring in adjacent non-burned forest stands
   that served as quasi-experimental controls. Strong species-specific
   responses to wildfire were evidenced, resulting in a dramatic post-fire
   decrease in overall bird abundance and species richness. Yet, red-listed
   bird species and conservation priority species in Switzerland were
   substantially more common in burnt than in control forest stands. Many
   red-listed species showed a bell-shaped numeric response to wildfire
   over time, suggesting low habitat suitability just after fire, high
   habitat suitability at pioneer and early stages of vegetation
   succession, followed by a long-term decrease in suitability while
   vegetation becomes denser, especially at ground level. As established
   for Mediterranean regions where wildfires are especially frequent, this
   study shows that forest fires can also boost the populations of
   red-listed and priority bird species typical of open and semi-open
   habitats in temperate biomes. Prescribed forest fire might represent a
   management option for preserving threatened elements of biodiversity
   despite the intense public debate it will trigger.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the use of post-fire aerial imagery to ground-based
   assessment for identifying building destruction and damage at the 2012
   Colorado Waldo Canyon Fire. We also compare active-fire defensive
   actions identified via manual and automated post-fire image
   classification to defensive actions documented from ground-based
   assessments (witness discussions, vehicle logs and images). For building
   destruction, manual and automatic image classification compared
   favourably to ground-based assessment, with low errors of commission
   (0.0-0.4\%) and omission (0-1.2\%). For building damage, classifying
   imagery manually had significant errors of commission and omission
   (59.0\% and 57.9\%) because ground-based assessments missed roof damage
   and image classification excluded interior and side damage, indicating
   the need for both techniques. Classifying imagery automatically for
   indicators of active-fire water suppression on buildings has Kappa
   statistics indicating a substantial agreement with documented water
   suppression. Manual and automatic image classification underestimated
   the full extent of documented defensive actions but showed a
   statistically significant dependence between fire cessation and
   defensive actions. These results show post-fire imagery to be a useful
   addition to other techniques for identifying building damage,
   destruction and defensive actions. Also demonstrated is the importance
   of accounting for defensive actions and other factors in wildland-urban

Abstract = {{Fire may increase the abundance of many understory plants in forested
   ecosystems, such as gap dependent herbs that respond quickly to
   increased light availability. Fire may or may not benefit some rarer
   understory herbs, such as stress-tolerant species specializing on rock
   outcrops. The latter species may benefit less from post-fire increases
   in light, and their slow-growing life histories might impair their
   abilities to survive, recover, and/or increase their rates of growth and
   reproduction following fires.
   We examined the impacts of prescribed and natural fire on Boechera
   constancei (Brassicaceae), a rare herb growing on and around outcrops of
   infertile serpentine rock in upper montane conifer forests of the
   northern Sierra Nevada, California. We analyzed demographic transition
   rates of marked plants in response to experimental burns in winter 2012
   and a subsequent lightning-caused fire in summer 2012. We measured leaf
   litter as a covariate, expecting that fire effects on B. constancei
   demography might be stronger in sites with more litter.
   Prescribed fire marginally decreased the fecundity of large individuals,
   but elasticity analyses found these rates to have no effect on estimated
   population growth, while the naturally occurring fire had no significant
   effects on demography. Leaf litter was not significant as a covariate in
   any analyses. Estimated population growth rates were thus unaffected by
   either prescribed or natural fire.
   Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that rock outcrop
   specialists are relatively insensitive to disturbance, and we suggest
   that such species may often have little bearing on the ecological costs
   and benefits of fire in forested systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Diversity of passerine birds and mammals was estimated in well-drained
   areas located at proximity of the hydroelectric reservoir La Grande-3,
   where natural fire regime still prevails in the absence of forest
   exploitation. Forest stands were divided up into four post-fire stages:
   (i) recent burns (4 years old), (ii) shrubs (25 years old), (iii) young
   forests (50 years old), and (iv) mature forests (greater than or equal
   to 71 years old). Richness and species diversity were highest in middle
   stages, in shrubs and young forests. The degree of opening seems to have
   affected more the composition of bird communities than stand age. Some
   bird species, typical of shrub stands, in particular white-crowned
   sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys Forster), Lincoln's sparrow (Melospiza
   lincolnii Audubon), and alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum Brewster),
   appeared after the falling bf dead trees, approximate to 15 years after
   fire, and disappeared progressively as forests matured. Deer mice
   (Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner), moose (Alces alces L.), and black bears
   (Ursus americanus Pallas) were more common at the beginning of
   succession, whereas northern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi
   Vigors) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus L.) were typical of late stages.
   Mammal presence was mostly associated to their feeding requirements.
   Fire creates a mosaic of forest stands through periodic killing of trees
   in the north of the boreal forest, which contributes to maintain
   regional wildlife diversity; its suppression would reduce biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Little research has been done to study the combined fire-drought impacts
   on the structure and functioning of Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems.
   In this study we have evaluated post-fire patterns of soil phosphorus
   (P) availability and transformation rates in a Mediterranean shrubland
   subjected to different drought treatments. Precipitation was manipulated
   in various treatments to evaluate the combined effects of fire and
   moisture in the soil. The following treatments were included: long-term
   historical average precipitation, or historical control (HC); moderate
   drought (MD, 25\% reduction from HC); severe drought (SD, 45\% reduction
   from HC); and environmental control without rainfall manipulation (EC).
   In late summer, these plots were burned in order to evaluate the joint
   effects of drought and fire. In order to compare burned and non-burned
   scenarios, unburned plots were maintained without rainfall manipulation.
   Post-fire soil samples, collected in the spring, were analyzed for P
   fractions, P transformation rates (net solubilization and
   immobilization, gross mineralization) and phosphatase activity. Mid- to
   high-intensity fire caused a short-term increase of rapid-to-mid
   turnover inorganic P pools in the soil, as well as a decline of rapid
   turnover organic P pools (including microbial P) and acid phosphatase
   activity. Fire also induced an overall rise in the flux among P pools,
   including gross P mineralization, net microbial immobilization and
   neogeochemical solubilization, with the latter being the most affected.
   Moreover, under drier than average conditions, this `mineralizing'
   effect of fire was partially (rapid turn over inorganic P. total P flux
   among pools and net solubilisation) or completely (net immobilization)
   offset. Thus, our results indicate that a drier environment will limit
   the extent of post-fire peak in soil P availability. This effect may act
   synergistically with increased water stress to further inhibit
   vegetation recovery after fire, possibility which is particularly
   relevant for fire-prone Mediterranean shrublands where P limitation is
   widespread. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. Invasive annual grasses alter fire regimes in shrubland ecosystems of
   the western USA, threatening ecosystem function and fragmenting habitats
   necessary for shrub-obligate species such as greater sage-grouse.
   Post-fire stabilization and rehabilitation treatments have been
   administered to stabilize soils, reduce invasive species spread and
   restore or establish sustainable ecosystems in which native species are
   well represented. Long-term effectiveness of these treatments has rarely
   been evaluated.
   2. We studied vegetation at 88 sites where aerial or drill seeding was
   implemented following fires between 1990 and 2003 in Great Basin (USA)
   shrublands. We examined sites on loamy soils that burned only once since
   1970 to eliminate confounding effects of recurrent fire and to assess
   soils most conducive to establishment of seeded species. We evaluated
   whether seeding provided greater cover of perennial seeded species than
   burned-unseeded and unburned-unseeded sites, while also accounting for
   environmental variation.
   3. Post-fire seeding of native perennial grasses generally did not
   increase cover relative to burned-unseeded areas. Native perennial grass
   cover did, however, increase after drill seeding when competitive
   non-natives were not included in mixes. Seeding non-native perennial
   grasses and the shrub Bassia prostrata resulted in more vegetative cover
   in aerial and drill seeding, with non-native perennial grass cover
   increasing with annual precipitation. Seeding native shrubs,
   particularly Artemisia tridentata, did not increase shrub cover or
   density in burned areas. Cover of undesirable, non-native annual grasses
   was lower in drill seeded relative to unseeded areas, but only at higher
   elevations.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Management objectives are more likely to
   be met in high-elevation or precipitation locations where establishment
   of perennial grasses occurred. On lower and drier sites, management
   objectives are unlikely to be met with seeding alone. Intensive
   restoration methods such as invasive plant control and/or repeated
   sowings after establishment failures due to weather may be required in
   subsequent years. Managers might consider using native-only seed
   mixtures when establishment of native perennial grasses is the goal.
   Post-fire rehabilitation provides a land treatment example where
   long-term monitoring can inform adaptive management decisions to meet
   future objectives, particularly in arid landscapes where recovery is
   slow.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{115-127}},
Abstract = {{By 1700 AD woodland covered only c. 4\% of the landscape of Scotland.
   The aim of this paper is to challenge the dominant ecological paradigm
   for the uplands, viz. that their treeless nature is largely
   anthropogenic, brought about by domestic stock grazing, tree felling and
   burning, and that woodland would naturally be the climax vegetation up
   to a climatically determined tree-line. The area under consideration
   comprises the uplands and marginal uplands of Scotland, north of the
   Highland boundary fault. The paper is a review of the relevant published
   literature on the history of the vegetation, together with the factors
   that influence vegetation pattern, in particular soils, competition,
   herbivores, fires and felling. There are plausible natural factors that
   could account for the open nature of the landscape without inferring
   human influence. Openness can arise because the soil provides
   sub-optimal conditions for tree regeneration, combined with the fact
   that the moorland vegetation can support herbivore populations in excess
   of that optimal for tree regeneration. It is possible that the current
   phase of the Holocene is equivalent to the oligocratic phase of previous
   interglacials where, on infertile soils, a period of woodland expansion
   was followed by natural woodland regression. If this analysis is
   correct, then the vegetation pattern for upland Scotland could be one of
   the most natural in Europe. This has major implications for the
   conservation of upland Scotland where, to date, woodland `restoration'
   is seen as a key conservation activity.}},
