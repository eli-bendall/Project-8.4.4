Abstract = {{The effect of wildfire and the subsequent harvesting on soil degradation
   was evaluated in a burned Pinus pinaster stand in Galicia (NW Spain).
   During the first year following a fire of moderate intensity, burned
   trees were not harvested and soil erosion losses, measured by sediment
   collection at the bottom of bordered plots, were very low. An apparently
   limited impact of fire on soil and reduced rainfall erosivity for this
   period could be responsible for that result.
   Salvage logging took place 13 months after fire. Three post-fire
   alternatives were compared: no harvesting (standing burned trees),
   harvesting + windrowed slash and harvesting + slash chopping. Soil
   losses were even lower during the 14 months after these treatments than
   for the previous pre-harvesting period. Again, low mineral soil
   exposition and rainfall erosivity seemed to contribute to that result.
   Changes in soil bulk density and soil shear strength after clearcutting
   and slash manipulation were small and not enough to trigger sediment
   yield significantly.
   Harvesting and logging operations apparently increased soil
   inhomogeneities. This degree of variability was more adequately assessed
   by using micro-plot fences instead of plot fences. The percentage of
   soil disturbed by machinery was the variable most related with the
   observed minor soil losses after harvesting, at micro-plot level. This
   study indicated that the combined effect of wildfire and clearcutting
   caused only an acceleration of soil erosion when significant exposition
   of mineral soil occurred after these perturbations. However, these
   results must be taken with caution because rain erosivity during the
   study was low. To delay post-fire clearcutting until several months
   after the fire could reduce the impact of this forestry operation on
   burned soils, taking advantage of the natural mulch created by scorched
   leaves fall, although other issues must be taken into account. Copyright

Abstract = {{Questions: What is the mechanism of bog ground layer colonization

   Location: Boreal bog peatland near Crow Lake, Alberta, Canada.
   Methods: Diaspore-addition treatments were applied in 2003 to autoclaved
   peat samples from high and low microtopographic positions within a
   recently burned bog. Colonization was assessed within the plots in 2005
   and compared to control plots to determine treatment success and
   patterns of colonization.
   Results: A significant degree of ground layer colonization was found two
   years after fire, with Polytrichum strictum dominating the site.
   Colonization was greater in low (wet) plots, although only P. strictum
   and Sphagnum angustifolium had significant colonization. No effect of
   diaspore addition was observed and Sphagnum was only found in
   conjunction with P. strictum.
   Conclusions: Environmental conditions and species life history strategy
   are more important than diaspore availability for post-fire
   colonization. True mosses (e.g. P. strictum) appear to facilitate
   Sphagnum colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a natural disturbance, though elemental losses and changes
   that occur during combustion and post-fire erosion can have long-term
   impacts on soil properties, ecosystem productivity, and watershed

   amendments with untreated, burned soils. We also conducted a greenhouse
   trial to examine how biochar influenced soil nutrient and water content
   under two wetting regimes. The effects of wood mulch on plant-available
   soil N and water content were significant and seasonally consistent
   during the three-year field study. Biochar applied alone had few effects
   under field conditions, but significantly increased soil pH, Ca, P, and
   water in the greenhouse. The mulched biochar treatment had the greatest
   effects on soil N and water availability and increased cover of the most
   abundant native plant. We found that rehabilitation treatments
   consisting of forest residue-based products have potential to enhance

Abstract = {{Understanding how communities change with time since fire is critical
   for identifying appropriate fire return intervals for biodiversity
   conservation. In infrequently-burnt communities, vegetation structure,
   habitat features and fuel availability can change over time-scales much
   longer than can be measured using contemporary remote-sensing
   approaches, creating challenges for conservation and fire management. To
   characterize longer-term patterns of vegetation structural change, we
   measured vegetation cover, ground cover, tree density and stand basal
   area across a multi-century time-since-fire sequence derived from growth
   ring-size relationships in fire-sensitive Eucalyptus salubris woodlands
   of south-western Australia. We hypothesized that: (i) vegetation
   structural components reflecting fuel availability increase with time
   since fire; (ii) recovery of vegetation structural components with time
   since fire requires long time-frames; and (iii) vegetation components
   indicating senescence are more evident in mature than intermediate
   fire-age classes. All vegetation structural components showed
   significant differences between time-since-fire classes (termed `young',
   `intermediate' and `mature'), and to a lesser extent between years of
   sampling. The two vegetation structural components with the highest
   covers overall, and hence likely greatest contributors to fuel
   availability, were vegetation 4-10 m high and ground fuel. These two
   layers showed non-monotonic changes indicating a peak at intermediate
   times since fire (similar to 35-150 or 35-250 years; depending on the
   model used to estimate stand age), conflicting with the common
   assumption that fuel availability increases with time since fire. Total
   stand basal area increased rapidly after fire then appeared to stabilize
   beyond about 100 years, with competition likely mediating
   density-dependent thinning such that declining plant density offset
   increasing trunk size. There was little evidence for an increase in
   standing dead vegetation in mature woodlands such as would suggest
   significant senescence when long-unburnt Replacement of mature woodlands
   with intermediate time-since-fire woodlands with greater cover and
   connectivity of key fuel layers potentially instigates a
   self-reinforcing fire regime shift favouring larger and/or more uniform
   fires. If such changes eventuate, substantial losses in conservation
   values in E. salubris woodlands are likely. Elucidating these changes in
   vegetation structure and implications for conservation management only
   became feasible due to the development of methods to estimate the time
   since fire of vegetation not burnt for hundreds of years. Crown

Abstract = {{Several attributes might influence the decomposition process of
   fire-killed trees. Here, we tested various tree-and plot-level variables
   on the decomposition rate of fire-killed black spruce (Picea mariana
   (Mill.) BSP) in the northern boreal forest. Data were collected from 474
   individuals burned 17 years prior to sampling. Mean decomposition rate
   was relatively slow (k = 0.013) and was lowest for severely burned snags
   (k = 0.001) and highest for lightly burned logs (k = 0.027-0.036).
   Vertical position and fire severity were the most important variables
   influencing the decomposition rates, while plot-level variables were
   marginally significant. Both predictors strongly influenced the moisture
   content of fire-killed trees. Logs with greater contact with the ground
   and lightly burned trees had higher moisture content and faster
   decomposition rates. Very severely burned trees had lower moisture
   content because of faster bark shedding. This hampered the decomposition
   process by slowing the snag falling rate. Higher decomposition rates in
   lightly burned trees may result from greater colonization by early
   xylophagous species. By having a considerable impact on the
   decomposition of woody debris, fire severity may strongly influence many
   post-fire biological processes related to the woody necromass as well as

Abstract = {{Fire occurrences are a common perturbation in Cerrado ecosystems, and
   may differently impact the local biodiversity. Arthropods are one of the
   taxa affected by fires, and among them, ants are known as good
   bioindicators. We aimed to evaluate the effect of anthropic fires on
   epigaeic and hypogaeic ant communities (species richness and
   composition) in Cerrado areas with different post-fire event recovery
   periods. We conducted the study in four Cerrado areas during two weeks
   of 2012 dry season: one unburned and three at different post-fire times
   (one month, one and two years). We sampled ants with pitfall traps in
   epigaeic and hypogaeic microhabitats. We collected 71 ant morpho-species
   from 25 genera. In the epigaeic microhabitat we sampled 56
   morpho-species and 42 in the hypogaeic microhabitat. The area with the
   shortest recovery time presented lower epigaeic ant species richness
   (4.3 +/- 2.00) in comparison to the other areas (8.1 +/- 2.68 species on
   one year area; 10.3 +/- 2.66 species on two years area; 10.4 +/- 2.31
   species on control area), but recovery time did not affect hypogaeic ant
   species richness. Regarding ant species composition, fire did not
   directly affect hypogaeic ant species, which remained the same even one
   month after fire event. However, two years were not enough to
   reestablish ant species composition in both microhabitats in relation to
   our control group samples. Our study is the first to assess anthropic
   fire effects upon epigaeic and hypogaeic ants communities; highlighting
   the importance of evaluating different microhabitats, to more accurately
   detect the effects of anthropic disturbances in biological communities.
   We concluded that ant communities are just partially affected by fire
   occurrences, and epigaeic assemblages are the most affected ones in
   comparison to hypogaeic ants. Furthermore the study provides knowledge
   to aid in the creation of vegetation management programs that allow
   Cerrado conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is used in fire-prone environments worldwide to
   reduce fuel loads and the severity and spread of future wildfires.
   Forest habitat structures, such as large trees, dead trees and logs are
   highly flammable, yet also are essential for animal species that require
   hollows (cavities) as den sites for shelter and reproduction. We
   examined the effects of experimental prescribed burns on the use of den
   sites by a small marsupial, the yellow-footed antechinus Antechinus
   flavipes, in south-eastern Australia. Specifically, we radio-tracked
   individual A. flavipes to identify forest habitat structures preferred
   as den sites and recorded the fate of known den sites following patchy
   prescribed burns. We found that large living trees and dead trees were
   used as den sites disproportionately to their relative abundance in the
   forest. While all marked individuals of A. flavipes survived the
   immediate impacts of patchy prescribed burns, almost a third (16/52) of
   den sites identified before burning were lost, including 17\% of trees
   (4/23) and 48\% of logs (10/21). The vulnerability of den sites to
   prescribed burns can be attributed to the decay-dependent effect of fire
   on both trees and logs, whereby, the amount of damage from fire is
   related to the structure's pre-fire condition (i.e. whether dead or
   alive, amount of decay). Large trees and large logs are scarce in this
   dry forest ecosystem and their replacement is likely to take a century
   or more due to the slow growth rates of trees. The ecological impacts of
   prescribed burning on habitat structures used by A. flavipes and other
   hollow-using species can be moderated by: (1) carrying out patchy,
   rather than complete burns; (2) ensuring the inter-fire interval is
   sufficient to allow time for replenishment of resources; and (3)
   planning at a regional scale to maintain an appropriate spatial pattern
   of post-fire age-classes, including areas retained as long-unburned
   (e.g. > 50 years) in which resources such as deep litter, large logs and
   dead trees can accumulate.}},

Abstract = {{Question: The study of temporal variation of plant-plant interactions
   has received little attention despite its importance in community
   dynamics. Successional processes triggered by disturbances such as fire
   may be determined by changes in key interactions between dominant woody
   plants. Taking advantage of a 95-yr-old post-fire natural experiment we
   assessed temporal shifts in post-fire interactions between woody
   resprouters and the obligate seeder tree Austrocedrus chilensis. We
   hypothesized that during the initial post-fire period, resprouters may
   facilitate A. chilensis trees' growth, while at advanced time since fire
   the interaction between A. chilensis trees and resprouters may turn to
   competition.
   Location: Northwestern Rio Negro province, Patagonia, Argentina.
   Methods: We selected pairs of A. chilensis trees and woody resprouters
   growing 80 cm apart (growing in association) and both A. chilensis trees
   and resprouters growing at more than 3 m apart from any individual
   (controls). We cored all individuals, measured ring widths and
   calculated basal area increment (BAI) and the relative interaction index
   (RII).
   Results: During mid-early stages of post-fire succession, A. chilensis
   trees' BAI was suppressed for at least 15 yr when growing in association
   with resprouters, and accordingly displayed a negative RII. Strikingly,
   during the same period, resprouters associated with A. chilensis trees
   showed higher BAI than control resprouters, and a positive RII. At
   advanced time since fire, RII showed a neutral interaction, and
   according to model estimations, the BAI of A. chilensis trees in
   association may eventually exceed control BAI whereas resprouters' BAI
   in association may decline earlier than that of the controls.
   Interestingly, A. chilensis trees and resprouters' growth was less
   correlated with climate when growing in association than when growing in
   isolation.
   Conclusions: Competition of resprouters over A. chilensis treess' growth
   during intermediate post-fire stages may be slowing the successional
   process. However, the association appears to be at the same time
   mutually beneficial as it buffers against adverse climatic conditions.
   Studying how plant growth varies along the succession is essential to
   understand community functioning and to predict possible alterations
   associated with changes in disturbance regimes due to climate change.}},

   compared herpetofaunal responses in burned forests to unburned forests,
   fewer studies have examined changes in the herpetofaunal community

   changes in habitat and relative abundance of reptiles and amphibians
   each year within a 3-year burn cycle in nine restored pine woodlands of
   western Arkansas, USA. Overall numbers of reptiles did not change among
   the three burn years; however, capture rates for one snake species
   (southern black racer {[}Coluber constrictor priapus]) and three lizards
   differed among the three post-burn years. Overall capture rate for
   anurans and all amphibians combined was greatest the first year after
   burning, mostly because captures of dwarf American toads (Bufo
   americanus charlessmithi) were substantially greater in stands the first
   year after burning. Salamander captures were infrequent. Capture rates
   of most reptile and amphibian species declined over the 3-year sampling
   period. Only minor changes in capture rate occurred among the 36 species
   we evaluated during the intervening years between frequent burns.
   Capture rates for only two species were lower the first year after fire.

Abstract = {{Fire trails provide access into vegetation for controlled burns in
   fire-prone regions of the world. We examined the ecological impacts of
   fire trails on plant assemblages in edge habitat adjacent to trails in
   eucalypt woodlands of World Heritage Blue Mountains National Park,
   southeastern Australia. We found that understory plant species richness,
   total plant density, and leaf mass per area (LMA) were significantly
   higher in fire-trail edge habitat than in the understory of interior
   woodland habitat without fire trails. Understory plant species
   composition also differed significantly between fire-trail edge and
   interior habitats. Higher total plant density, higher LMA, and
   compositional differences in understory assemblages of fire-trail edge
   habitat were significantly related to increases in the availability of
   photosynthetically active radiation. In addition, higher soil clay
   content in fire-trail edges, which is linked to increased soil water
   availability for plant growth, was significantly related to higher
   species richness and compositional differences in the understory, as
   well as to compositional differences in overstory assemblages. From a
   conservation and management perspective, we suggest that, although
   significant ecological effects of fire trails on plant assemblages in
   edge habitats were detected, our work provides evidence that fire trails
   are unlikely to lead to serious conservation issues such as local
   extirpations of native species or the facilitation of exotic plant
   invasion. Nevertheless, our study has identified those plant species
   that are unique to, or particularly sparse or common in, fire-trail
   habitat, which should be prioritized for demographic and distributional
   monitoring should the need arise to increase the extent of fire trails

Abstract = {{Forests in the western U.S. are subject to a variety of pathogens, whose
   role in forest health is being questioned. The relationship of dwarf
   mistletoe (Arceuthobium americanum Nutt. ex Engelm.) and time since
   stand-replacing fire was determined for part of the Medicine Bow
   National Forest in southeastern Wyoming. Mean dwarf mistletoe rating
   (0-6 scale) was found to be 0.85 in the study area as a whole and ranged
   from 0-5.82. Of 43 stands examined, 51\% contained mistletoe to some
   degree. Dwarf mistletoe infection was light in the majority of the
   sampled stands in the study area. Dwarf mistletoe infection
   characteristics generally increased with increasing time since
   stand-replacing fire but were highly variable. Mean dwarf mistletoe
   infection characteristics generally increased with tree size, but were
   also highly variable. Chi-square analysis indicates that trees surviving
   the most recent stand-replacing fire increased dwarf mistletoe infection
   rates in the post-fire stands. Dwarf mistletoe infection at the
   landscape scale is characterized by infection centers, as some stands
   have heavy mistletoe infection while stands of similar age have no
   mistletoe infection present. If prescribed fires are used to restore the
   health of lodgepole pine forests, these fires will need to be intense,
   stand-replacing burns. But, healthy lodgepole pine forests may always
   contain a mosaic of mistletoe infection centers and uninfected stands
   that require a spatial approach to health assessment. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Provision of woodfuel is an important ecosystem service of dry forests
   and woodlands. However, charcoal production through selective logging of
   preferred hardwood species has the potential to alter the physiognomic
   composition of the residual or re-growth woodlands and may lead to their
   deterioration and degradation. This study, conducted through forest
   inventory in Mutomo District in Kenya, assessed the impact of charcoal
   production on unprotected dry woodlands in terms of tree density,
   targeted species basal area, species richness, evenness and Shannon
   diversity. The parameters of the disturbed woodlands were evaluated for
   significant differences with those of the neighbouring protected Tsavo
   East National Park, which served as a reference for an ecologically
   undisturbed ecosystem. By evaluating a consequence of tree harvesting
   for charcoal production, this study confirmed the overall significant
   differences between the protected and unprotected woodlands in all the
   tested parameters. To confirm if the differences in the land-covers of
   the woodlands had any influence on their degradation, all mentioned
   parameters were compared between the four differentiated classes and
   their respective control plots in the protected areas. At the
   ``land-cover level{''}, the statistically significant difference in the
   basal area of tree species preferred for charcoal production between the
   protected and unprotected open trees confirms that the class with a high
   density of large mature trees is the prime target of charcoal producers.
   In addition, there seems to be a general trend of lower values of tree
   species richness, evenness and Shannon diversity for the unprotected
   woodlands subjected to charcoal production. On the other hand, the
   disturbed woodlands display the potential to recover through their
   comparably high saplings density. The findings make an important
   contribution to the discourse on the impact of charcoal production in
   dry woodlands, a topic that is highly controversial among researchers.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Recovery trajectories derived from remote sensing data are widely used
   to monitor ecosystem recovery after disturbance events, but these
   trajectories are often retrieved without a precise understanding of the
   land cover within a scene. As a result, the sources of variability in
   post-disturbance recovery trajectories are poorly understood. In this
   study, we monitored the recovery of chaparral and conifer species
   following the 2007 Zaca Fire, which burned 97,270 ha in Santa Barbara
   County, California. We combined field survey data with two time series
   remote sensing products: the relative delta normalized burn ratio
   (RdNBR) and green vegetation (GV) fractions derived from spectral
   mixture analysis. Recovery trajectories were retrieved for stands
   dominated by six different chaparral species. We also retrieved recovery
   trajectories for stands of mixed conifer forest. We found that the two
   remote sensing products were equally effective at mapping vegetation
   cover across the burn scar. The GV fractions (r(78) = 0.552, p < 0.001)
   and normalized burn ratio (r(78) = 0.555, p < 0.001) had nearly
   identical correlations with ground reference data of green vegetation
   cover. Recovery of the chaparral species was substantially affected by
   the 2011-2017 California drought. GV fractions for the chaparral species
   generally declined between 2011 and 2016. Physiological responses to
   fire and drought were important sources of variability between the
   species. The conifer stands did not exhibit a drought signal that was
   directly correlated with annual precipitation, but the drought likely
   delayed the return to pre-fire conditions. As of 2018, 545 of the 756
   conifer stands had not recovered to their pre-fire GV fractions. Spatial
   and temporal variation in species composition were important sources of
   spectral variability in the chaparral and conifer stands. The chaparral
   stands in particular had highly heterogeneous species composition.
   Dominant species accounted for between 30\% and 53\% of the land cover
   in the surveyed chaparral patches, so non-dominant land cover types
   strongly influenced remote sensing signals. Our study reveals that
   prolonged drought can delay or alter the post-fire recovery of
   Mediterranean ecosystems. It is also the first study to critically
   examine how fine-scale variability in land cover affects time series
   remote sensing analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major environmental factor influencing vegetation
   heterogeneity, with closed forest and savanna ecosystems having
   different management needs due to their different responses to fire
   disturbance. However, the differences in post-fire vegetation dynamics
   between these ecosystems have seldom been compared using a uniform set
   of parameters. Additionally, post-fire dynamics of forest-savanna
   ecotones is poorly characterized. With the hypothesis that closed
   forest, savannas and ecotones will exhibit different post-fire
   responses, we studied the vegetation diversity, structure and dynamics
   in an upland forest savanna vegetation mosaic in Minas Gerais, Brazil
   following a fire that occurred in September 2011. In January 2012, we
   identified, tagged, and measured the basal diameter of all regenerating
   juvenile tree stems within forty-six 4 m(2) plots in closed forest,
   savanna and ecotone vegetation, and conducted recensuses in 2013 and
   2014. We modelled the relationship between short-term dynamics
   parameters (recruitment, mortality, basal area loss and gain, and the
   turnover and net changes in the number of individual stems and basal
   areas) and vegetation type. Species diversity was higher in closed
   forests and ecotones than in savanna. Across all vegetation types, stem
   density decreased and basal area increased. Parameters such as
   recruitment, net changes in the number of individuals, and the gain,
   loss and turnover in basal area did not differ across vegetation types.
   However, stem mortality was higher in closed forest and ecotones
   combined than in savannas, and the net change in the number of
   individuals was the lowest in the savanna. Overall, our results support
   that within a climatically-similar vegetation mosaic, closed forests
   exhibit different post-fire regeneration dynamics from savanna as
   expected. Ecotones exhibited post-fire responses and dynamics more
   similar to closed forests than to savanna, but more studies will be
   needed to establish if this pattern is applicable to other areas.
   Understanding the longer-term vegetation dynamics and plant regeneration
   patterns is a potential next step that will help inform fire management
   strategies for forest-savanna mosaics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sprouting vigour is determined by the plant amount of reserves and
   intrinsic growth rate of plants. While the first factor has been well
   studied, the second is far less understood. Although a higher growth
   rate would imply a higher sprouting vigour, fast-growing species may
   have less below-ground reserves, and thus, a lower sprouting potential.
   The relative importance of both opposite effects was little explored in
   the literature. To analyse the influence of growth rate on sprouting
   vigour, one growth season after a fire we measured plant height of the
   old (pre-fire) and new (post-fire) tissue in 194 individuals of 14 woody
   species from a woodland in central Argentina. We calculated a mean value
   of pre- and post-fire height for each species, and obtained from a
   database potential height at maturity, wood density (WD) and specific
   leaf area (SLA), as surrogates of intrinsic growth rate. We performed a
   forward stepwise multiple regression using WD and SLA, together with
   mean pre-fire height or potential height as independent variables, and
   mean post-fire height (as an indicator of resprout vigour) as the
   dependent variable. Interactions were also tested. Pre-fire height, WD
   and their interaction term were the variables that best explained
   post-fire height. We also analysed the relationship between pre- and
   post-fire size for each species independently by fitting hyperbolic
   functions. Then we correlated both parameters of the functions to
   species characteristics (WD, SLA, potential height and mean pre-fire
   height). Both parameters of the hyperbolic functions were significantly
   correlated only with WD, but not with the other species characteristics.
   All results together indicate that species with low WD (i.e. high
   potential growth rate) regrow more vigorously than species with high WD
   when pre-fire individuals were tall. In contrast, when pre-fire
   individuals were small, WD had no influence on sprout vigour. A
   trade-off between allocation of biomass to underground reserves and
   shoot growth seems to be responsible for the patterns obtained. For
   small individuals, below-ground reserves seem to play a more important
   role than inherent growth rate (here measured through WD) in determining
   the sprouting vigour, while for large individuals, growth rate seems
   more important than reserves.}},

   two and three years after fire, with two trials per year (7200 monitored

   computing a transformed-Ripley's K function and Moran's I correlograms.
   There was a large spatial and temporal variability in acorn predation,

Abstract = {{Understanding tropical forest diversity is a long-standing challenge in
   ecology. With global change, it has become increasingly important to
   understand how anthropogenic and natural factors interact to determine
   diversity. Anthropogenic increases in fire frequency are among the
   global change variables affecting forest diversity and functioning, and
   seasonally dry forest of the southern Amazon is among the ecosystems
   most affected by such pressures. Studying how fire will impact forests
   in this region is therefore important for understanding ecosystem
   functioning and for designing effective conservation action. We report
   the results of an experiment in which we manipulated fire, nutrient
   availability, and herbivory. We measured the effects of these
   interacting factors on the regenerative capacity of the ecotone between
   humid Amazon forest and Brazilian savanna. Regeneration density,
   diversity, and community composition were severely altered by fire.
   Additions of P and N + P reduced losses of density and richness in the
   first year post-fire. Herbivory was most important just after
   germination. Diversity was positively correlated with herbivory in
   unburned forest, likely because fire reduced the number of reproductive
   individuals. This contrasts with earlier results from the same study
   system in which herbivory was related to increased diversity after fire.
   We documented a significant effect of fire frequency; diversity in
   triennially burned forest was more similar to that in unburned than in
   annually burned forest, and the community composition of triennially
   burned forest was intermediate between unburned and annually burned
   areas. Preventing frequent fires will therefore help reduce losses in
   diversity in the southern Amazon's matrix of human-altered landscapes.}},

   experienced these wildfires. The 2001 wildfires occurred during a
   drought year which was followed by an extended period of low rainfall.
   Substantial flows did not occur in either of the burnt sub-catchments

   function of stem diameter. Fire-driven mortality was lower in stems
   protected by the crowns of larger trees than in stems that were in the
   open. There was also evidence to suggest that the effects of fire are
   exacerbated by the prior action of frost and elephant herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Many pines growing in fire-prone ecosystems exhibit an abundant
   production of cones and the retention of part of these cones as an
   aerial seed bank in the canopy (serotiny). The protection of seeds and
   their prolific release after fire facilitate the re-colonization of the
   burned area. However, over-stocking in this fire regenerated stands may
   constraint tree growth, as well as increase the risk of new wildfires.
   Therefore, thinning is strongly recommended both to reduce fire
   occurrence and to reduce intraspecific competition. Although the
   benefits of thinning for tree growth in fire regenerated forests have
   been thoroughly documented, less attention has been paid to the effects
   on reproductive traits such as the timing of reproduction, the size of
   the cone crop and the degree of serotiny. In this study, the effects of
   thinning on the reproductive traits of fire regenerated Pinus halepensis
   forests with different regeneration age (22-, 18- and 10-yr-old) were
   investigated. In the thinned plots, there was a greater increase in the
   percentage of pines that started producing cones for the first time
   (thinning = 50.4 +/- 11.4\%, control = 13.3 +/- 4.0\%), as well as an
   increase in the number of new cones produced per pine (between two- and
   six-fold compared to the control stands). Our results show that thinning
   may decrease serotiny depending on age. Thus, the number of pines
   bearing open cones did not change during the study in the thinned or
   control plots of the younger stands (10 yrs) or in the control plots of
   22 and 18 yrs, while it increased in the thinned stands of 22 and 18
   yrs. Not a single cone was observed to open during the study in the
   thinned or control 10-yr-old plots, while in the 22- and 18-yr-stands
   the number of old serotinous cones per pine opened was higher in the
   thinned plots than in the control ones. Therefore, we conclude that
   thinning in fire regenerated R halepensis forests should be conducted in
   younger stands (10-yr-old, in our study), because thinning at this age
   shortens the juvenile (non-reproductive) period and greatly increases
   the number of new cones produced per pine in completely serotinous
   individuals. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   burned basins to change. Sediment tracing techniques offer an approach
   to quantify this sediment source response to burning. In this paper, we
   review the application of various sediment tracers to discriminate
   sediment sources following wildfire. This includes studies examining
   changes in fallout radionuclide, geochemical and mineral magnetic
   properties of burned soil to identify possible fire-related effects on
   tracer properties and behaviour. Previous work suggests that fallout
   radionuclides (Cs-137, excess Pb-210, Be-7, (PU)-P-239,240) may provide
   the most effective tracers for post-fire sediment source and budgeting
   studies. Other tracer properties seem to be overly susceptible to burn
   effects and might provide a less consistent basis for post-fire source
   discrimination. The final selection of tracer properties for use in
   sediment tracing applications should reflect the likely controls of
   individual tracer concentrations in different sources and their
   potential response to burning.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is commonly used to reduce the risk of severe
   wildfire. However, further information about the associated
   environmental effects is required to help forest managers select the
   most appropriate treatment. To address this question, we evaluated if
   fire severity during spring prescribed burning significantly affects the
   resprouting ability of two common shrub species in shrubland under a
   Mediterranean climate in NW Spain. Fire behaviour and temperatures were
   recorded in tagged individuals of Erica australis and Pterospartum
   tridentatum during prescribed burning. The number and length of
   resprouted shoots were measured three times (6, 12 and 18 months) after
   the prescribed burning. The influence of a series of fire severity
   indicators on some plant resprouting vigour parameters was tested by
   canonical correlation analysis. Six months and one year after prescribed
   burning, soil burn severity (measured by the absolute reduction in depth
   of the organic soil layer, maximum temperatures in the organic soil
   layer and the mineral soil surface during burning and the post-fire
   depth of the organic soil layer) reduced the resprouting vigour of E.
   australis and P. tridentatum. In contrast, direct measurements of fire
   effects on plants (minimum branch diameter, duration of temperatures
   above 300 degrees C in the shrub crown and fireline intensity) did not
   affect the post-fire plant vigour.
   Soil burn severity during spring prescribed burning significantly
   affected the short-term resprouting vigour in a mixed heathland in
   Galicia. The lack of effects eighteen months after prescribed burning
   indicates the high resilience of these species and illustrates the need
   to conciliate fire prevention and conservation goals. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The quokka, Setonix brachyurus, is a medium- sized, macropodid marsupial
   that is endemic to south- western Australia. It has declined markedly in
   its distribution and abundance since the early 1930s and is listed as
   vulnerable under IUCN criteria. The presence or absence of quokka
   populations at 66 sites in the northern jarrah forest of Australia was
   investigated using generalised linear models ( GLM). We hypothesised
   that fox control and the presence of a mosaic of post- fire seral stages
   within Agonis linearifolia swamp vegetation were important in predicting
   the presence of quokkas. The number of poison meat baits delivered per
   hectare, the average number of years since the swamps burnt and the
   number of post- fire age classes within the swamps ( mosaic value) were
   used as explanatory variables. Two models had substantial support (Delta
   AIC(c) < 2), with the best approximating model including the variables
   `baiting' and `swamp age', and the second-best model including the
   additional variable `swamp mosaic value'. The two best models had Akaike
   weights ( weight of evidence as being the best model of the data) of
   0.465 and 0.308 respectively. We used an information-theoretic approach
   and multimodel inference to determine the best approximating model of
   baiting, swamp age and swamp mosaic, and Akaike weights to assess model
   fit and to rank variable importance. Baiting had a model average
   parameter estimate of 98, swamp age 79 and a mosaic of swamp age classes
   42, implying that baiting was more than twice as important as the number
   of swamp ages classes at a site in predicting the occurrence of quokkas.
   Evidence from our analysis therefore supports previous studies that
   concluded that continued fox control and the maintenance of a mosaic of
   early seral stage (< 10 years since fire) and long unburnt habitat (> 19
   years since fire) are essential for its conservation.}},

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Research Highlights:Fire-frequented savannas are dominated by plant
   species that regrow quickly following fires that mainly burn through the
   understory. To detect post-fire vegetation recovery in these ecosystems,
   particularly during warm, rainy seasons, data are needed on a small,
   temporal scale. In the past, the measurement of vegetation regrowth in
   fire-frequented systems has been labor-intensive, but with the
   availability of daily satellite imagery, it should be possible to easily
   determine vegetation recovery on a small timescale using Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecosystems with a sparse
   overstory.Background and Objectives:We explore whether it is possible to
   use NDVI calculated from satellite imagery to detect time-to-vegetation
   recovery. Additionally, we determine the time-to-vegetation recovery
   after fires in different seasons. This represents one of very few
   studies that have used satellite imagery to examine vegetation recovery
   after fire in southeastern U.S.A. pine savannas. We test the efficacy of
   using this method by examining whether there are detectable differences
   between time-to-vegetation recovery in subtropical savannas burned
   during different seasons.Materials and Methods:NDVI was calculated from
   satellite imagery approximately monthly over two years in a subtropical
   savanna with units burned during dry, dormant and wet, growing
   seasons.Results:Despite the availability of daily satellite images, we
   were unable to precisely determine when vegetation recovered, because
   clouds frequently obscured our range of interest. We found that, in
   general, vegetation recovered in less time after fire during the wet,
   growing, as compared to dry, dormant, season, albeit there were some
   discrepancies in our results. Although these general patterns were
   clear, variation in fire heterogeneity and canopy type and cover skewed
   NDVI in some units.Conclusions:Although there are some challenges to
   using satellite-derived NDVI, the availability of satellite imagery
   continues to improve on both temporal and spatial scales, which should
   allow us to continue finding new and efficient ways to monitor and model
   forests in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Fire suppression has altered the historical mixed-severity fire regime
   and homogenised forest structures in Jasper National Park, Canada. We
   used dendrochronology to reconstruct fire history and assess forest
   dynamics at 29 sites in the montane forests. Based on fire scars and
   even-aged post-fire cohorts, we determined 18 sites had mixed-severity
   fire histories through time, and 11 sites had evidence of high-severity
   fires only - yielding a mixed-severity fire regime for the study area.
   Lodgepole pine, hybrid spruce and Douglas-fir established simultaneously
   after low- and high-severity fires. Regardless of fire history, forest
   canopies were mixed in composition and subcanopies were strongly
   dominated by shade-tolerant hybrid spruce. Despite their size, subcanopy
   trees were similar in age to the canopy trees. Current stand composition
   and age structures largely reflect the effects of high-severity fires
   that burned similar to 110 years ago at 18 of 29 sites. In the absence
   of fires after 1905, forests have matured simultaneously, homogenising
   the landscape and resulting in forest structures that are more conducive
   to high-severity fire than are fires of a range of severities. Proactive
   fire management is justified to restore fire as a vital ecological
   process and promote forest resilience by countering the effects of a

   The addition of prescribed burning enhanced the effects of the wildlife

   heterogeneity of these factors. Soil moisture variability appeared to be
   independent of treatments. Shelterwood cutting increased first-year

Abstract = {{After a wildfire, moss crust develops in early post-fire stages
   revealing important roles related to soil erosion prevention and
   increase of soil fertility. However, the post-fire management selected
   could determine the capacity of soil to recover and the active role of
   mosses in the ecosystem recovery. Salvage logging (SL) was performed in
   the wildfire that occurred in July 2012 in ``Sierra de Mariola Natural
   Park{''} (E Spain), with detrimental consequences to soils in the
   short-term. The aim of the study is to assess if the presence of a
   biocrust dominated by mosses six years after the wildfire improved the
   soil quality and functions, and if the salvage logging management
   influenced the process. Our results showed that the SL management
   affected in a medium-term to the percentage of soil covered by mosses,
   reaching 78.4\% in control soils compared to 56\% in SL soils. Regarding
   the influence of mosses in soils, our results did not show greater
   differences in the physical parameters measured, hydraulic conductivity,
   water repellency and soil penetration resistance, possibly related to
   the lower developmental stages of the biocrust. However, it was observed
   that the presence of mosses played a significant role in both the soil
   fertility and the microbial activity. The improvement in soil fertility
   was registered mainly in the organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous
   contents, and for the microbial parameters, for which higher values for
   the microbial biomass carbon and basal soil respiration were reached in
   soils under mosses. In conclusion, we can suggest that mosses had an
   important role in the functional recovery of degraded ecosystems after
   wildfires, and therefore we encourage considering the presence of mosses

Abstract = {{Burn severity classifications derived from multitemporal Landsat
   Thematic Mapper images and the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) are commonly

   efforts to retrospectively map historical burn severity require
   defensible, objective methods of classifying continuous differenced
   Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) data where field data are often
   unavailable. For three fires, we compare three methods of classifying
   pre- and post-fire Landsat data: (1) dNBR classification using Composite
   Burn Index (CBI) field data to assign severity classes; (2) fuzzy
   C-means classification of a dNBR image; (3) local Getis-Ord statistic
   (Gi{*}) output applied to a dNBR image, classified using fuzzy C-means
   clustering. We then use a Kappa statistic to evaluate the agreement of
   severity classes assigned to a pixel with its corresponding CBI plot.
   For two of the three fires, the C-means clustering of the dNBR and the
   Gi{*} output performed as well or better than dNBR images classified
   using CBI data, with strong agreement for moderate-and high-severity
   classes. These results suggest that clustering of dNBR data may be a
   suitable approach for classifying burn severity data without field data.
   This method may also be useful as a tool for rapid post-fire assessments
   (e.g. Burned Area Emergency Response and Burned Area Reflectance
   Classification maps), where images must often be classified quickly and
   subjectively. Further analysis using additional field data and across
   different vegetation types will be necessary to better understand the

   Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, often overly dense from a

   severe wildfires especially given warmer and drier climate projections

   established 60 plots per fire, 10 in each of five post-fire mortality
   classes: 0-20\%, 21-40\%, 41-60\%, 61-80\%, and 81-100\% mortality,
   based on percentage of trees killed, plus unburned control areas. We
   measured height, diameter, status (alive or dead) and crown base height
   of each tree, plus fuel loading by size class, litter and duff depth,
   and herbaceous biomass. Ten years after wildfire, low mortality (0-40\%)
   plots resembled unburned plots in almost every fuels attribute. Basal
   area in low-mortality plots exceeded reconstructed historical ranges and
   fire hazard reduction targets by up to 130\%. However, coarse woody
   debris (CWD; woody material >7.62 cm) loadings fell below a recommended
   ``optimum{''} range and herbaceous fuels were sparse. Mid-mortality
   (41-80\%) plots were characterized by more open stands and increased
   surface fuel loadings, basal area was close to target ranges and CWD
   loadings were within the recommended range. High mortality (81-100\%)
   plots had few trees but CWD loadings exceeded recommended levels by up
   to 28\%, and herbaceous fuels were adequate to carry a surface fire.
   These findings suggest that post-fire management should be targeted to
   the level of mortality. Low mortality and unburned areas should be
   targeted for reducing stand densities and promoting understory growth,
   to minimize crown fire hazard and increase site potential. Burned areas
   with >80\% tree mortality have the lowest crown fire hazard, but may
   benefit from fuel reduction efforts such as low intensity prescribed
   burning to reduce both fine fuels and some of the CWD. Stand structures
   and surface fuel loads in mid-mortality plots most resembled historical
   targets and met numerous restoration objectives for ponderosa
   pine-dominated forests, especially given predicted climate changes.
   These areas can be maintained through low-intensity prescribed burning
   to prevent them from becoming overly dense and thus enhance their
   longer-term resiliency to future disturbances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean pine species of low-and mid-elevations, namely Pinus
   halepensis Mill., Pinus brutia Ten., Pinus pinea L. and Pinus pinaster
   Ait., constitute an important component of forest vegetation in
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems around the Mediterranean basin. These
   forests are strongly influenced by wildfires, which have occurred for
   millennia in Mediterranean regions. In burned Mediterranean pine
   forests, the community composition and the population dynamics of soil
   arthropods are determined by their life history traits and the wildfire
   regime. In these ecosystems, the effects of fire regime on soil
   arthropods at the taxonomical level of order are similar to those
   recorded in other Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Severe wildfires cause
   a simplification of the structure of the soil community due to both the
   immediate mortality of soil animals and the structural alteration of the
   soil organic horizon. Frequent wildfires influence the soil arthropods
   indirectly, preventing the recovery processes of the vegetation and,
   consequently, of the organic horizon. Wildfires do not influence the
   phenology of soil arthropods, at least at the taxonomical level of
   order, and the seasonality of the Mediterranean climate remains the
   principal environmental factor controlling the dynamics of soil
   arthropod populations. The recovery patterns of soil arthropods vary in
   relation to species, fire regime, and the environmental characteristics
   of the forest under consideration.}},

Abstract = {{1. Global change is threatening ecosystems and biodiversity world-wide,
   creating a pressing need to understand how climate and disturbance
   regimes interact and influence the persistence of species. We quantify
   how three ecosystem drivers - rainfall, fire and herbivory - influence
   vital rates in the perennial resprouting graminoid, Triodia scariosa, a
   foundation species of semi-arid Australia.
   2. We used an 11-year dataset from a fire and herbivore exclosure
   experiment, to model flowering, post-fire recruitment and the post-fire
   survival of seedlings and resprouting plants. Regression modelling
   quantified the effect of rainfall, inter-fire interval, fire type
   (wildfire or prescribed fire), grazing by herbivores (native and feral)
   and an interaction between fire type and herbivory on T. scariosa
   populations.
   3. Rainfall, fire and herbivory had significant effects on post-fire
   recruitment and the survival of seedlings and resprouting plants,
   including strong interactions between these drivers. Herbivory following
   wildfire had a minor effect, but in years of below-average rainfall
   herbivory following prescribed fire had a large effect, reducing the
   survival of seedlings and resprouting plants by 20\% and over 50\%
   respectively, relative to post-fire survival under average rainfall
   conditions.
   4. Variation in rainfall underpinned significant variation in post-fire
   resprouting and seedling survival, thus we postulate rainfall primarily
   drives the dynamics of T.scariosa populations.
   5. Synthesis. This study highlights the importance of modelling
   interactions between key ecosystem drivers when predicting how changes
   in global climate and disturbance regimes influence plant vital rates.
   Relatively small changes to disturbance regimes can substantially alter
   population processes, even in perennial resprouting species. This work
   suggests that conservation of foundation species, such as T.scariosa,
   will benefit if fire management decisions are better integrated with
   inter-annual weather forecasts and herbivore management.}},

Volume = {{337}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Fire can shape insect communities, and subcortical insects are
   especially affected because their hosts can sustain extensive fire
   injuries. Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (mountain pine beetle) is a
   subcortical bark beetle, and the most economically and ecologically
   significant insect species in western North American conifer forests. In
   a recent study we found that although endemic-level D. ponderosae
   preferentially colonized fire-injured Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine)
   trees after prescribed fire, colonization rates decreased consistently
   over a 4-year period. Determining possible mechanisms driving this
   decline is important for understanding the post-fire population dynamics
   of bark beetle species that can kill healthy trees during periodic
   outbreaks. As D. ponderosae populations at endemic population levels are
   associated with a diverse subcortical community, we investigated whether
   the beetles' responses to fire are mediated by interactions with
   competitors and natural enemies at the community level. We surveyed
   subcortical insect communities for 3 consecutive years using three types
   of passive traps (emergence, landing, and flight intercept), intended to
   capture a wide variety of insect families in non-burned and burned
   stands. Insects were grouped by both family and functional group
   (predators, parasitoids, and competitors). We identified 5243
   individuals of the subcortical community to three orders (Coleoptera,
   Diptera, and Hymenoptera) and 31 families, as well as one sub-family.
   Using Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), we found that the
   subcortical community was almost always associated with burned stands,
   and that variation in both competitors and predators drove this pattern.
   Additionally, the community differed between areas with and without D.
   ponderosae. Since D. ponderosae are poor competitors with other bark and
   wood boring beetles, and are regulated by natural enemies and
   competitors at endemic levels, we propose that interactions with the
   subcortical community negatively affect their post-fire colonization in
   P. contorta forests and may partially explain colonization decline over
   time in western Canada. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Relationship between post-fire regeneration and leaf economics spectrum

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{103-110}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recent work has identified global-scale relationships between key leaf
   traits (leaf economics spectrum). However, it is important to determine
   whether this approach can be applied at local scale with smaller subsets
   of species facing similar environments. Since fire is a key process in
   Mediterranean shrubland dynamics we analyze whether fire-related
   life-history traits influence the pattern of correlation between the
   leaf economic spectrum and leaf moisture traits.
   Using structural equation modelling and exploratory path analysis, we
   developed alternative models to test how interspecific leaf traits are
   related to the seasonal variation of water content (leaves and shoots)
   and to the type of post-fire regeneration of Mediterranean woody
   species.
   This study demonstrates that for these species seasonal variation in
   water content and fuel moisture would be better predicted by the
   presence or absence of a trait describing post-fire seedling
   establishment than by the leaf economic spectrum traits. However, leaf
   dry matter content (LDMC) is influenced by both the leaf economic
   spectrum and the post-fire regenerative type.
   Seeder species (those that recruit via seeds immediately after fire)
   present lower LDMC and higher relative seasonal variation of relative
   water content (RWCrsv) than non-seeders. We hypothesize that since
   seeder species mostly evolved under the Mediterranean climate, they
   developed a particular strategy of drought tolerance (without causing an
   effect to the relation between the volume occupied by cytoplasm relative
   to the volume occupied by cell walls), which is the cause of the
   observed relation between LDMC and RWCrsv.
   This study suggests that the leaves of Mediterranean woody species would
   follow the general leaf economics spectrum (Wright et al. 2004) but that
   specific selective forces, such as disturbance regime, acting at
   regional scale also play a relevant role to explain leaf traits related
   to water content.}},

Abstract = {{Tree regeneration was compared in burned and unburned portions of a
   tropical dry forest (1110 mm ppt/year) and a tropical humid forest (1542
   mm ppt/year) in southeastern Bolivia. Both forests burned 5 years prior
   to our study, and both forests were also lightly selectively logged
   (intensity < 1 m(3)/ha)-the dry forest during the 1970 and 1980s and the
   humid forest just prior to the wildfire. The objective of this study was
   to compare abundance, size, and mode (seedling or resprout) of tree
   regeneration in burned and unburned areas of these forests, focusing on
   the most common canopy tree species and the commercial timber species at
   each site. Regeneration of 13 species of trees was quantified in the
   humid forest and 12 species in the dry forest. Tree regeneration <5 cm
   basal diameter but >20 cm tall was more abundant in the dry forest ((x)
   over bar = 1807 stems/ha) than in the wet forest (x = 490 stems/ha). In
   both forests, resprouts were generally larger but less abundant than
   seedlings. In the dry forest, regeneration of the following commercial
   tree species was significantly more abundant in the burned areas:
   Cedrela fissilis, Anadenanthera colubrina, Astronium urundueva, and
   Centrolobium microchaete. However, Acosmium cardenasii, a canopy tree
   species not marketed for timber in Bolivia, represented the majority of
   regeneration (63\%) in the dry forest and was equally abundant in burned
   and unburned areas (similar to1100 stems/ha). In the humid forest, only
   one timber species, Aspidosperma rigidum, was more abundant in burned
   than unburned areas (51 vs. 0 stems/ha, respectively). Another timber
   species that is rarely harvested in the region, Pseudolmedia laevis, was
   significantly less abundant in the burned than unburned area (22 vs. 173
   stems/ha, respectively). The results of this study suggest that
   controlled burning could increase the abundance of timber tree
   regeneration at the dry forest site and to a lesser extent at the humid
   forest site. No data were collected to assess the likelihood that this
   increased density of regeneration will result in increased harvestable
   timber. However, local forest management institutions do not presently
   appear capable or motivated to conduct fire management-whether for
   enhancing timber regeneration or for limiting the damage caused by
   accidental wildfires. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mountain forests deserve special attention from ecologists and

   of grassland and scrub. Due to overgrazing and burning, however, these
   woodland patches are believed to cover only 11\% of their potential area

   species diversity for the Bolivian Polylepis woodland remnants, assessed
   the conservation status of the occurring species, determined their
   trophic niche, and related species richness with climatic variables and
   elevation. Based in 31 publications, we found 780 identified species

   butterflies and 8 reptiles. Ten of the 13 Bolivian Polylepis species, as

   In general, plant species richness increased with increased

   species richness, precipitation and length of the growth season. The
   highest bird endemism in Polylepis woodland remnants occurred at

   richness decreased with increasing maximum temperature. Finally, we

Abstract = {{In eastern Australia the practice of grazing cattle in eucalypt forests
   and woodlands, as a supplementary activity to farmland grazing, is
   widespread. It is typically accompanied by burning at frequent intervals
   by graziers to promote more nutritious and digestible growth of the
   ground cover for their livestock. Collectively, these forest grazing
   practices affect understorey structure, which in turn affects other
   biotic and abiotic components of these ecosystems. In order to test how
   significant the effects of forest grazing practices are relative to the
   effects of other management practices and environmental variables and
   the degree to which grazing practices determine understorey vegetation
   structure, we surveyed 58 sites on the northern tablelands of New South
   Wales, Australia. All sites were located in eucalypt forest and were
   stratified by grazing status (presence or absence): time since logging,
   time since wildfire, geology, aspect, slope and topographic position. At
   each site an index of vegetation complexity and the most abundant plant
   species were recorded. The data were analysed by a backwards stepwise
   multiple regression. Grazing practices had the greatest influence on
   understorey vegetation complexity of any of the measured attributes. The
   grazed sites were characterized by a significantly lower vegetation
   complexity score, different dominant understorey species, reduced or
   absent shrub layers, and an open, simplified and more grassy understorey
   structure compared with ungrazed sites. Time since logging and time
   since wildfire also significantly affected understorey structure. Our
   results indicate that cattle grazing practices (i.e. grazing and the
   associated frequent fire regimes) can have major effects on forest

Abstract = {{Tree removal is often applied to woodland-encroached rangelands to
   restore vegetation and improve hydrologic function, but knowledge is
   limited regarding effects of tree removal on hydrologic response. This
   study used artificial rainfall and overland flow experiments (9-13 m(2))
   and measures of vegetation and ground cover to investigate short-term
   (1-2 yr) responses to tree removal at two woodland-encroached sites.
   Plots were located under trees (tree zone) and in the intercanopy
   (shrub-interspace zone, 75\% of area). Before tree removal, vegetation
   and ground cover were degraded and intercanopy runoff and erosion rates
   were high. Cutting and placing trees into the intercanopy did not
   significantly affect vegetation, ground cover, runoff, or erosion 1 yr
   post-treatment. Whole-tree mastication as applied in this study did not
   redistribute tree mulch within the intercanopy, but the treatment did
   result in enhanced herbaceous cover and hydrologic function in the
   intercanopy. Fire removal of litter and herbaceous cover increased
   tree-zone runoff and erosion under high-intensity rainfall by 4- and
   30-fold at one site but had minimal impact at the other site. Site
   response differences were attributed to variability in burn conditions
   and site-specific erodibility. Burning had minimal impact on
   shrub-interspace runoff and erosion from applied high-intensity
   rainfall. However, 1 yr postfire, erosion from concentrated overland
   flow experiments was 2- to 13-fold greater on burned than unburned
   tree-zone and shrub-interspace plots and erosion for burned tree zones
   was 3-fold greater for the more erodible site. Two yr postfire, overland
   flow erosion remained higher for burned versus unburned tree zones, but
   enhanced intercanopy herbaceous cover reduced erosion from
   shrub-interspace zones. The net impact of burning included an initial
   increase in erosion risk, particularly for tree zones, followed by
   enhanced herbaceous cover and improved hydrologic function within the
   intercanopy. The overall results suggest that erosion from
   late-succession woodlands is reduced primarily through recruitment of
   intercanopy herbaceous vegetation and ground cover. Published by

Abstract = {{Forest areas restored after mining typically take decades, or longer,

   Individuals also differed significantly in their microhabitat use and

   species would rapidly recolonise restored sites and that no
   modifications to current restoration practices were required to
   accelerate their return. Prescribed burning of restored areas could
   negatively affect this species but the effect would be short-term (< 2
   years). The approach used in this study could be used to develop
   management prescriptions that accelerate the return of late-successional
   species to restored sites.}},

Abstract = {{In open woodlands and savannas, fire is often the dominant disturbance
   that shapes and maintains their structure and dynamics. Numerous studies
   have explored tree-grass coexistence under different fire regimes in
   these ecosystems; however, there is a lack of research on the tree-tree
   relationship in the presence or absence of fire. In the present study,
   we explored the effects of fire regime on tree spatial pattern,
   mortality and regeneration in the Argentine Caldenal, which is one of
   the most endangered and least studied open woodlands in the Neotropics.
   While there was no significant difference in the overall tree density
   between frequently burned and fire-excluded regimes, we found clear
   divergences between fire regimes in the within-stand spacing of not only
   all trees, but also of large and small trees in addition to their
   spatial interactions. In contrast with previous results from other
   frequently burned open forests, trees in the Caldenal were randomly
   distributed in burned plots whereas both mid-and long-term fire
   exclusion lead to the strong short-scale aggregation of trees. In the
   absence of fire, both large and small trees were significantly clumped,
   but in the frequently burned woodlands, large and small trees had a
   tendency to repulsion and aggregation, respectively. Fire regime also
   significantly affected tree mortality and regeneration mechanisms in the
   Caldenal. Our mortality analysis indicated that fire suppression led to
   the shift from fire-induced to competition-driven mortality of trees.
   When analysing tree regeneration, we found a lack of seedlings in any of
   the fire regimes but the presence of vigorous sprouting only in
   frequently burned plots. The present study thus revealed the key role of
   frequent fires in the Caldenal open woodlands because recurrent burning
   not only shaped the spatial arrangement of trees, but fire-induced
   mortality also triggered an essential tree recruitment mechanism in
   these ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale, rapid reductions in forest and woodland tree cover caused
   by fire, drought-induced die-off, or wildfire-mitigating thinning
   prescriptions, all three of which differentially affect canopy
   structure, are increasingly altering coniferous-dominated landscapes
   across extensive regions such as western USA. These types of reductions
   in canopy cover can result in substantial increases in near-ground solar
   radiation, which in turn drive numerous ecological processes. However,
   existing relationships for how reductions in canopy cover translate into
   changes in incoming near-ground solar radiation do not account for the
   ways in which fire, die-off, and thinning differentially alter either or
   both the foliar and woody components of canopy architecture and the
   degree to which such alterations depend on foliar density. We
   systematically quantified trends in near-ground solar radiation for a
   broad range of canopy cover for two of the most extensive semiarid
   coniferous forest and woodland vegetation types in the western USA:
   those dominated by a combination of pinon and juniper (using Pinus
   edulis and Juniperus monosperma as representative species) or by
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). We used hemispherical photography to
   account for how canopy architecture affected mean and variance in
   near-ground solar radiation over a broad range of canopy cover (from as
   low as similar to 5\% to as high as similar to 85\%). For both
   vegetation types, we evaluated four disturbance types: undisturbed,
   controlled burns, drought- and beetle-induced die-off, and prescriptive
   thinning treatments. We also assessed near-ground solar radiation for
   undisturbed vegetation spanning an elevation continuum that included
   both pinon-juniper and ponderosa pine vegetation types. Our results
   quantify how near-ground solar radiation varies substantially and
   systematically among forest gradient types and as a function of forest
   disturbance type. Trends in near-ground solar radiation differed among
   gradients associated with fire, die-off, or thinning, dependent on how
   each affects the foliar and/or woody components of canopy architecture.
   Deviations from undisturbed conditions for remaining disturbed tree
   cover were greatest for burned, intermediate for die-off and least for
   thinned. The differences in microclimate quantified here and how they
   vary with type of tree reduction are relevant for assessing vegetation
   responses following reductions in tree cover. In addition, the
   differences are large enough to require consideration in evaluating land
   surface interactions of forests and woodlands with the atmosphere (e.g.,
   increases of >40 W m(-2) relative to undisturbed conditions). Our
   results provide a means to enable managers to rapidly relate
   readily-obtainable field estimates of canopy cover to approximate
   estimates of near-ground solar radiation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Questions (a) How did seedling numbers and species composition change in
   the first year after a wildfire during drought, relative to pre-fire
   variation? (b) Has the community returned to pre-fire composition after
   five years? (c) Has the degree of dominance by exotic annual grasses
   changed? (d) Is there any evidence that drought conditions affected
   community cover, before or after fire? Location Exotic-dominated annual
   grassland in southern California, USA. Methods We monitored community
   cover and native annual forb densities for four years before and four
   (cover) to five (densities) years after an unintentional fire (fall
   2013) coinciding with the spring 2012-2019 California drought. We also
   measured seedling emergence both before and during the first year
   post-fire. We assessed post-fire changes in cover and density relative
   to pre-fire variation, and tested correlations between community cover
   and annual rainfall measures. Results Seedling emergence declined
   strongly after fire for exotic grasses, but remained stable for exotic
   forbs. Seedling densities of the most common native forbs declined, but
   several previously-rare natives increased. Community cover initially
   shifted towards the exotic forbs Erodium spp., then returned to higher
   exotic grass densities. Yet the previously dominant Bromus diandrus
   declined steeply, even as other exotic grasses and some native forbs
   increased. Up to five years after fire, relative cover and abundance of
   the most common exotic and native species still differed from pre-fire
   composition. Common species were uncorrelated with annual precipitation,
   but several may have responded to shorter growing seasons. Conclusions
   Immediate post-fire conditions favoured exotic and native forbs over
   grasses, as predicted. Yet in contrast to many previous studies, the
   community did not return quickly to pre-fire composition but showed
   persistent changes that favoured neither natives nor exotics. Our
   results suggest post-fire recovery in this habitat may be contingent on
   abiotic conditions, with drought one potential explanation for changes.}},

Abstract = {{The floristic composition dynamics of a primary forest in the Brazilian
   Amazon, which was affected by fire in 1997, was analyzed by comparing
   data from sample inventories carried out in 1983, 1987, 1989, 1995, 2008
   and 2012 in 12 plots of 0.25 ha each including therefore previous (14

   area of dense ombrophilous forest, unaffected by anthropogenic
   disturbances, in the Tapajos National Forest, Para state, Brazil. The
   questions of this study are the following: (1) What is the effect of a
   fire on the tree species composition of a mature forest in the Amazon?
   (2) Is there a difference in the diversity of tree species between
   before and after fire? To answer these questions, (i) the pre-and
   post-fire tree species composition were described, quantified and
   compared, and (ii) the richness and diversity of pre-and post-fire tree
   species were quantified and compared. After 15 years of fire, the forest
   had no loss in richness and diversity of tree species, indicating good
   resilience to the fire disturbance. The post-fire changes in the
   floristic composition of this primary forest are mainly driven by the
   gain and loss of locally rare species. Furthermore, some tree species
   with higher density and basal area were responsible for the maintenance
   of the forest structure, especially Rinorea guianensis Aubl. and Protium

Abstract = {{After wildfire, surviving trees are of major ecological importance as
   they can help in the post-fire regeneration process. Although these
   trees may be damaged, they may also benefit from reduced fuel hazard and
   competition. However, little is known about the long-term growth
   response of surviving trees.
   This study aims to explain short- to long-term variations in the
   postfire growth of surviving black pines in an area burnt in 1994,
   focusing on levels of fire severity and tree sizes.
   Relative basal area increments were used to detect time-course
   variations in postfire radial tree growth depending on fire severity.
   Linear mixed-effects models were used to describe the factors affecting
   postfire ring growth.
   In the short term, fire caused stronger reduction in growth in small
   trees with increasing bole char height. However, as time since fire
   increased, a positive effect of fire on growth due to reduced
   competition counteracted the short-term fire impacts. Indeed, small
   surviving trees demonstrated a surge in growth 15 years after the fire.
   It was concluded that reduced competition might offset the short-term
   negative effects of fire in surviving black pines.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, rainforests have been considered vulnerable to fire.
   Recent research, however, has shown that many rainforest species can

   species resprouted after the experimental burn, predominantly from buds

   resulted in reduced overall plant height and resprouting from buds lower
   on the stem. Increasing proportions of W. nobilis litter generated fires
   with higher intensities and fuel consumption compared with rainforest
   angiosperm litter. Moreover, fuel moisture content decreased with
   increasing W. nobilis litter proportions. Higher litter flammability may
   result in increased likelihood of fire ignition and fire severity near
   W. nobilis trees, which would negatively impact the juveniles of all
   three rainforest species. Alternatively, after lower-temperature fires
   (e.g. in rainforest angiosperm litter), W. nobilis may have an advantage

Pages = {{378-390}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important disturbance affecting hydrological processes
   through alteration of vegetation cover and soil characteristics. The
   effects of fire on hydrological systems at the catchment scale are not
   well known, largely because site specific data from both before and
   after wildfire are rare. In this study a modelling approach was employed
   for change detection analyses of one such dataset to quantify effects of
   wildfire on catchment hydrology. Data from the Entiat Experimental
   Forest (Washington State, US) were used, a conceptual runoff model was
   applied for pre- and post-fire periods and changes were analyzed in
   three different ways: reconstruction of runoff series, comparison of
   model parameters and comparison of simulations using parameter sets
   calibrated to the two different periods. On average, observed post-fire
   peak flows were 120\% higher than those modelled based on pre-fire
   conditions. For the post-fire period, parameter values for the snow
   routine indicated deeper snow packs and earlier and more rapid snowmelt.
   The net effect of the changes in all parameters was largely increased
   post-fire peak flows. Overall, the analyses show that change detection
   modelling provides a viable alternative to the paired-watershed approach
   for analyzing wildfire disturbance effects on runoff dynamics and
   supports discussions on changes in hydrological processes.}},

   overwhelming tendency within the wildland fire community to regard
   Byram's flame length-fireline intensity and Van Wagner's crown scorch
   height-fireline intensity models as universal in nature. However,
   research has subsequently shown that such linkages among fire behaviour
   and post-fire impact characteristics are in fact strongly influenced by
   fuelbed structure, thereby necessitating consideration of fuel complex
   specific-type models of such relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial variability (i.e. heterogeneity) of environmental variables
   determines a wide range of ecosystem features and plays a key role in
   regulating key ecosystem services. Wildfires are among the most
   significant natural disturbances that forests face, but our knowledge
   about their effect on ecosystem spatial variability is still limited. We
   used a 19-year fire chronosequence of natural, unmanaged Pinus
   canariensis C. Sm. ex DC forests to investigate how wildfires affect
   overall ecosystem spatial variability, as well as that of key faunal,
   plant and soil ecosystem attributes. The spatial variability of most
   soil variables and of the overall ecosystem tended to decrease after the
   fire and remain lower than the unburned plots even after 19 years. The
   spatial variability of plant-related variables, except for litter
   decomposition, as well as that of soil arthropods abundance, decreased
   more gradually than that of soil variables, reaching the lowest values
   in the plots burned 19 years before the survey. Our study provides
   evidence that wildfires are capable of significantly decreasing
   local-scale forest spatial heterogeneity through changes in the spatial
   variability of their different components, with likely yet unknown
   consequences for ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus massoniana forests bordering South China are often affected by
   wildfires. Fires cause major changes in soil properties in many forest
   types but little is known about the effects of fire on soil properties
   in these P. massoniana forests. Such knowledge is important for
   providing a comprehensive understanding of wildfire effects on soil
   patterns and for planning appropriate long-term forest management in
   these forests. Changes in soil physical properties, carbon, nutrients,
   and enzymes were investigated in a P. massoniana forest along a
   wildfire-induced time span consisting of an unburned soil, and soils 0,
   one, four, and seven years post-fire. Soil (0-10 cm) was collected from
   burned and unburned sites immediately and one, four, and seven years
   after a wildfire. The wildfire effects on soil physical and chemical
   properties and enzyme activities were significantly different among
   treatment variation, time variation, and treatment-by-time interaction.
   Significant short-term effects on soil physical, chemical, and
   biological properties were found, which resulted in a deterioration of
   soil physical properties by increasing soil bulk density and decreasing
   macropores and capillary moisture. Soil pH increased significantly in
   the soil one-year post-fire. Carbon, total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
   (P), and available N and P increased significantly immediately and one
   year after the wildfire and decreased progressively to concentrations
   lower than in the unburned soil. Total potassium (K) and exchangeable K
   increased immediately after the wildfire and then continuously decreased
   along the burned time-span. Urease, acid phosphatase, and catalase
   activities significantly decreased compared to those in the unburned
   soil. In fire-prone P. massoniana forests, wildfires may significantly
   influence soil physical properties, carbon, nutrients, and enzyme

Abstract = {{Fire is often viewed as destructive of wildlife and wildlife habitat,
   because it can cause dramatic change. The perception of catastrophic
   fire that burns up forests and kills wildlife has been fostered to
   enlist public support for suppressing fires. A message that is much more
   difficult to convey is that when fire is removed from the landscape
   important wildlife habitat can be slowly and subtly eliminated from
   ecosystems that depend on the frequent occurrence of fire.
   Many fire-dependent communities-shortleaf pine forests, barrens, glades,
   prairies, balds, and oak savannas-are embedded in the extensive and
   diverse central hardwood landscape. Approximately 232 species of birds
   (119 breeding, 44 wintering, and 69 year-round residents) reside in this
   landscape. Some of the rarer bird species in the region are closely tied
   to fire-dependent habitats. The status of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker
   (Picoides borealis) is tenuous in pine forests of Kentucky and Oklahoma
   where fire has been suppressed for much of the century. Efforts to
   reintroduce fire to restore the open-structured, pine-dominated forests
   are hopeful signs for the species. Grassland birds are one of the most
   rapidly declining groups of species in North America. Habitat conversion
   has eliminated many of the grassland communities within the Central
   Hardwoods region, but plant succession in the absence of fire has also
   degraded habitat suitability for many grassland birds. Numerous
   preserves are being established to retain the rare biota of these
   grasslands. Many oak-dominated forests and oak woodland- savanna mosaics
   are slowly shifting to greater proportions of trees more associated with
   mesic conditions, such as maples (Acer sp.), acid canopy closure. These
   shifts in structure and composition bring attendant changes in the avian
   community. Fire-with proper consideration of the potential effects on
   small populations of birds and invertebrates and the tradeoffs in bird
   species that will be favored-is an essential tool for habitat
   maintenance for some of the rare and declining birds in the Central
   Hardwoods region.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Have millennia of human land use fundamentally altered the
   vegetation of a large proportion of the high Andean puna biome, with
   natural vegetation now restricted to inaccessible areas? Can
   inaccessible ledges be used as surrogates to infer the potential natural
   vegetation (PNV) in heavily impacted areas of the puna ecosystem of the
   high Andes? Is there a difference in plant community composition and
   diversity between the potential natural puna vegetation, represented by
   areas inaccessible to grazing and burning, and the anthropogenically
   disturbed vegetation found on nearby, but accessible, slopes?
   Location: Abra Maalaga Private Conservation Area, Cusco, southern
   Peruvian Andes.
   Methods: Four study habitats were chosen that comprised ledges and
   slopes from within and outside of the conservation area. For each
   habitat, vegetation composition was recorded using eight to twelve 2 x
   2-m(2) plots studied for species cover and abiotic variables.
   Results: Analysis of species richness using two-way ANOVAs with Tukey
   test found that plots from the three habitats inaccessible to
   anthropogenic disturbance exhibited similar richness levels, whereas
   plots accessible to grazing and anthropogenic burning had significantly
   higher species richness. Likewise, CCA separated out plots of the three
   habitats inaccessible to anthropogenic disturbance from the unconserved
   slope plots. Species indicator analyses found the three inaccessible
   habitats to share the largest number of indicator species, with none
   being shared by the accessible, unconserved slope habitat. The PNV,
   inferred from the inaccessible vegetation, comprises a mosaic of
   Polylepis pepei woodland and tussock grassland, dominated by Festuca
   aff. procera, Luzula gigantea, Valeriana mandoniana and Carex
   pichinchensis.
   Conclusions: As both the conserved and unconserved ledge habitats
   contain a vegetation that approaches that of the conserved slope, ledges
   can be taken as a surrogate to infer the PNV in heavily impacted areas
   where no conserved slopes are available. From preliminary data, the
   presumed PNV of the study area corresponds to a distinct vegetation
   assemblage including species previously unknown to science. Adjacent
   disturbed, accessible land contained a higher species diversity, with a
   flora that may have originated from localized, disturbed natural
   habitats.}},

Title = {{Disjunct and decoupled? The persistence of a fire-sensitive conifer
   species in a historically frequent-fire landscape}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{55}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Local and regional species extirpations may become more common as
   changing climate and disturbance regimes accelerate species' in situ
   range contractions. Identifying locations that function as both climate
   and disturbance refugia is critical for biodiversity conservation. Here,
   we investigate the persistence of a disjunct, fire-sensitive conifer
   population, yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis), in the
   historically frequent-fire landscape of the Blue Mountains in eastern
   Oregon, USA. We used tree rings to reconstruct multi-century fire
   histories, which were then used to compare historical mean fire return
   intervals (MFRIs) inside of the cedar grove to the surrounding dry
   forest matrix, as well as to examine relationships between historical
   fire occurrence and reconstructed climate. We also examined trends in
   post-fire yellow-cedar mortality and regeneration between 2006, when the
   grove burned in a wildfire, through 2017. Results indicated that fire
   was less frequent in the cedar grove (MFRI = 35.8 years) than in the
   surrounding dry mixed-conifer forest (MFRI = 14.4 years). Historical
   fire occurrence was associated with hotter and drier conditions.
   Following the 2006 fire, cedar mortality was high (>90 \%), but by 2017
   post-fire regeneration was abundant (median = 8125 seedlings ha(-1)).
   The eastern Oregon cedar grove appears to occupy a fire refugium
   historically decoupled from the frequent-fire regime of the broader
   landscape. The topographic position of the grove suggests it is also a
   climate refugium. Managing for climate and disturbance refugia has been
   identified as an important option for conservation in the context of
   rapid global change, and this study provides evidence that locations
   where climate and disturbance refugia overlap may be disproportionately
   important for the maintenance of regional biodiversity. However, active
   management may be required for populations to persist in some of these
   locations as anthropogenic change is capable of overwhelming the
   underlying buffering capacity of refugia.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic and thermoregulatory capacities of the Macedonian mouse
   (Mus macedonicus) of a population from a post-fire habitat on Mount
   Carmel, Israel, were studied. Post-fire habitats in the Mediterranean
   ecosystem of Mount Carmel are invaded by species that exist in the
   forest margins, including M. macedonicus, which established the largest
   mice population at early stages of recovery. Therefore, it was of great
   interest to study its thermoregulatory physiology. Mice were acclimated
   to a photoperiod of 12L:12D at an ambient temperature of 27 degreesC.
   The aim of this study was to reveal the physiological capacities of M
   macedonicus that enable its invasion into the exposed, dry and hot
   post-fire habitats on Mount Carmel at the early stages of recovery. The
   results of our study show that M. macedonicus has a relatively low
   metabolic rate, which is also reflected in its relatively low food and
   energy consumption. Its thermoneutral zone is 32-37 degreesC, with a
   high lower critical point, similar to desert-adapted rodent species.
   This species has a relatively high overall thermal conductance 0.295 +/-
   0.04 ml O(2)(.)g(-1.)h(-1.)degreesC(-1). However, its nonshivering
   thermogenesis capacity is within the range of other rodent species of a
   mesic origin, such as wood-mice. These physiological adaptations can
   partly explain its ability to cope with the challenges of post-fire
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions are one of the major causes of biodiversity loss.
   Anthropogenic alteration in fire regimes has promoted plant invasion in
   several regions and ecosystems worldwide, especially in those where
   fires are historically rare. This is the case of the UNESCO Biosphere
   Reserve Torres del Paine National Park (TPNP), located in southern South
   America. In this study, we hypothesised that the seeds of native species
   of the TPNP do not resist fire-related high soil temperatures as do
   exotic plants, which could facilitate the spread of exotic plant
   invasion in post-fire environments. To test this hypothesis, we exposed
   seeds of plant species collected from the TPNP to different heat doses
   (60 degrees C, 5 min; 90 degrees C, 5 min; 90 degrees C, 10 min; 120
   degrees C, 5 min) and compared their final germination and viability
   with those of unheated seeds. The study was conducted on five native
   species and three aliens inhabiting the TPNP. Almost all the seeds of
   native species died after exposure to temperatures higher than 60
   degrees C, whereas seeds of the alien species resisted higher heat
   doses. The on-site resistance of the aliens (through fire-tolerant soil
   seed banks) and the fire sensitivity of native seeds contribute to our
   understanding on post-fire invasion in the TPNP.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{207-220}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Questions
   What influence does mechanical mastication and other fuel treatments
   have on: (1) canopy and forest floor response variables that influence
   understory plant development; (2) initial understory vegetation cover,
   diversity, and composition; and (3) shrub and non-native species density
   in a second-growth ponderosa pine forest.
   Location
   Challenge Experimental Forest, northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA.
   Methods
   We compared the effects of mastication only, mastication with
   supplemental treatments (tilling and prescribed fire), hand removal, and
   a control on initial understory vegetation response using a randomized
   complete block experimental design. Each block (n=4) contained all five
   treatments and understory vegetation was surveyed within 0.04-ha plots
   for each treatment.
   Results
   While mastication alone and hand removal dramatically reduced the
   midstory vegetation, these treatments had little effect on understory
   richness compared with control. Prescribed fire after mastication
   increased native species richness by 150\% (+6.0 species m2) compared
   with control. However, this also increased non-native species richness
   (+0.8 species m2) and shrub seedling density (+24.7 stems m2).
   Mastication followed by tilling resulted in increased non-native forb
   density (+0.7 stems m2).
   Conclusions
   Mechanical mastication and hand removal treatments aided in reducing
   midstory fuels but did not increase understory plant diversity. The
   subsequent treatment of prescribed burning not only further reduced fire
   hazard, but also exposed mineral soil, which likely promoted native
   plant diversity. Some potential drawbacks to this treatment include an
   increase of non-native species and stimulation of shrub seed
   germination, which could alter ecosystem functions and compromise fire
   hazard reduction in the long-term.}},

Title = {{The role of fire in the competitive dynamics of coast redwood forests}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a major component of the disturbance regime and a critical
   determinant of competitive outcomes in many ecosystems. In forests
   dominated by coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), fire was frequent and
   ubiquitous prior to European settlement, but fires have been exceedingly
   small and rare over the last 70-80 years because of aggressive fire
   prevention and suppression policies. As a result, many aspects of
   redwood fire ecology remain poorly understood. However, in 2008 a single
   storm ignited numerous fires throughout the redwood region, providing a
   rare opportunity to conduct replicated fire effects research. One year
   post-fire, we investigated competitive dynamics by quantifying bole
   survival and basal sprouting, for redwood and associated species, at
   four field sites that spanned much of the latitudinal range of redwood
   and encompassed (1) second-growth and old-growth stands, (2) burned and
   unburned areas, and (3) a wide range of fire severities. We employed a
   mixed effects analytical framework and found that: (1) the probability
   of bole survival was greater for redwood than for its primary competitor
   (tanoak; Notholithocarpus densiflorus), (2) this divergence was much
   more pronounced at higher fire severities, and (3) tanoak exhibited a
   slight advantage in terms of post-fire basal sprouting, but the
   dominance of tanoak basal sprouts in burned areas was reduced relative
   to unburned areas. For many disturbance types in many ecosystems, the
   empirical data necessary for effective management decisions are lacking,
   and studies incorporating vegetative tree regeneration are especially
   scarce. Our work demonstrates the importance of utilizing unique field
   research opportunities to test current theories, while unequivocally
   documenting that fires of all severities increased the abundance of
   redwood relative to tanoak, and that higher severity fires more strongly
   favored redwood.}},

   woodland}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Stand-replacing wildfire is an infrequent but important disturbance in
   southwestern pinyon-juniper woodlands. A typical successional cycle in
   these woodlands is approximately 300 years or more after a
   stand-replacing fire. Arthropods, especially ground-dwelling taxa, are
   one of the most abundant and diverse fauna in terrestrial ecosystems and
   are typically responsive to microhabitat change. Little is known
   regarding community responses of ground-dwelling arthropods to changes
   in woodland successional stages from early ecosystems dominated by
   grasses, herbaceous plants, and fire adapted shrubs to tree-dominated
   old-growth ecosystems. In 2007 and 2008, within Mesa Verde National
   Park, Colorado, we compared the community composition of ground-dwelling
   arthropods between old-growth pinyon-juniper stands that were 300-400
   years old and early successional areas recovering from a stand-replacing
   fire in 2002. The 2002 fire eliminated the dominant woody vegetation,
   which was replaced by increased herbaceous vegetation and bare ground.
   The early successional arthropod community showed a significantly higher
   abundance in major arthropod taxonomic groups, except spiders, compared
   to old-growth woodland. Old-growth species richness was greater in late
   August-September, 2007 and greater in early successional habitats during
   April-July, 2008. Spatial variability of the habitat was much greater in
   the recently burned early successional plots than the old-growth late
   successional plots. The differences in habitat were strongly correlated
   with arthropod community composition, suggesting that ground-dwelling
   arthropods are very sensitive to habitat changes. Habitat affiliation
   was strong, with 83\% (early succession ruderal) and 91\% (old-growth
   woodland) of the species found primarily or exclusively in one habitat.
   Many habitat indicator species (defined as species found in
   significantly greater abundance in one habitat) were found in both
   burned and old-growth habitats. Several species were found to be strict
   specialists exclusive to only one of these habitats. Collectively, the
   results suggest that heightened concern over loss of old-growth
   woodlands is warranted, given the distinct nature of the ground-dwelling
   arthropod community in old-growth habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Recent observations suggest that repeated fires could drive
   Mediterranean forests to shrublands, hosting flammable vegetation that
   regrows quickly after fire. This feedback supposedly favours shrubland
   persistence and may be strengthened in the future by predicted increased
   aridity. An assessment was made of how fires and aridity in combination
   modulated the dynamics of Mediterranean ecosystems and whether the
   feedback could be strong enough to maintain shrubland as an alternative
   stable state to forest. A model was developed for vegetation dynamics,
   including stochastic fires and different plant fire-responses.
   Parameters were calibrated using observational data from a period up to
   100 yr ago, from 77 sites with and without fires in Southeast Spain and
   Southern France. The forest state was resilient to the separate impact
   of fires and increased aridity. However, water stress could convert
   forests into open shrublands by hampering post-fire recovery, with a
   possible tipping point at intermediate aridity. Projected increases in
   aridity may reduce the resilience of Mediterranean forests against fires
   and drive post-fire ecosystem dynamics toward open shrubland. The main
   effect of increased aridity is the limitation of post-fire recovery.
   Including plant fire-responses is thus fundamental when modelling the
   fate of Mediterranean-type vegetation under climate-change scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of post-fire
   defoliation on axillary bud viability and mortality of Piptochaetium
   napostaense (Speg.) Hack. and Poa ligularis Nees. at different
   phenological stages. Both species are cool-season perennial native
   grasses highly preferred by cattle in the semi-arid region of central
   Argentina. The following treatments were established for each species:
   no defoliation (control), early-season defoliation (vegetative stage)
   and late-season defoliation (internode elongation stage). Ten plants
   were assigned randomly to each treatment. Fire treatment was applied at
   the end of the annual growing cycle of both species.
   Our results would suggest that early-season defoliation during the first
   year after fire might reduce axillary bud viability in P. nopostaense
   and P ligularis. In addition, P. napostaense was more susceptible to
   early-season defoliation than P. ligularis. Post-fire defoliation,
   principally early-season defoliation, might increase plant mortality in
   P. napostaense, but it does not seem to affect P. ligularis. Therefore,
   a period with no grazing after fire might be the key factor to protect
   axillary buds, and subsequently permit the re-establishment of the
   photosynthetic canopy through the production of new tillers, favouring
   mainly the persistence of P. napostaense in the community. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Jack pine barrens, once common in northern lower Michigan, mostly have
   been converted to managed jack pine plantations. Management of the
   disturbances associated with logging provides the opportunity to
   maintain the unique plant assemblages of jack pine barrens and nest
   habitat of the federally endangered Kirtland's warbler. Studies indicate
   that Carex pensylvanica can develop into dense mats and strongly compete
   with other barrens species such as Vaccinium angustifolium, which seem
   to be important species for Kirtland's warbler nest locations. According
   to forest managers, the most important factors facilitating high cover
   of V. angustifolium and reducing cover of C. pensylvanica are the amount
   of shade produced by tree crowns before harvest (pre-harvest shade), the
   length of time between harvest and planting (planting delay), and fire.
   We found that high or low levels of pre-harvest shade had no effect on
   cover of either V. angustifolium or C. pensylvanica. Planting delays of
   at least three years following prescribed bums generally increased cover
   of V. angustifolium in forest plots, which are important for warbler
   nesting. Analysis of community composition in openings indicated that
   burning enhanced the growth of barrens species. We found only weak
   evidence for a negative correlation between the cover of V.
   angustifolium and C. pensylvanica on our study sites. The openings
   created in the jack pine plantation are important refugia for barrens
   flora that would likely be lost under forests managed strictly for jack
   pine. Maintenance of jack pine barrens flora and Kirtland's warbler nest
   habitat is possible within the context of a heavily managed forest
   plantation system.}},

Pages = {{33-41}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants) is a prominent dispersal mechanism
   in many environments, and can play a key role in local vegetation
   dynamics. Here we investigate its interaction with another key process
   in vegetation dynamics-fire. We examine ant dispersal of seeds
   immediately before and after experimental burning in an Australian
   tropical savanna, one of the world's most fire-prone ecosystems.
   Specifically, our study addressed the effects of burning on: (1) the
   composition of ants removing seeds, (2) number of seed removals, and (3)
   distance of seed dispersal. Fire led to higher rates of seed removal
   post-fire when compared with unburnt habitat, and markedly altered
   dispersal distance, with mean dispersal distance increasing more than
   twofold (from 1.6 to 3.8 m), and many distance dispersal events greater
   than the pre-fire maximum (7.55 m) being recorded. These changes were
   due primarily to longer foraging ranges of species of Iridomyrmex, most
   likely in response to the simplification of their foraging landscape.
   The significance of enhanced seed-removal rates and distance dispersal
   for seedling establishment is unclear because the benefits to plants in
   having their seeds dispersed by ants in northern Australia are poorly
   known. However, an enhanced removal rate would enhance any benefit of
   reduced predation by rodents. Similarly, the broader range of dispersal
   distances would appear to benefit plants in terms of reduced
   parent-offspring conflict and sibling competition, and the location of
   favourable seedling microsites. Given the high frequency of fire in
   Australian tropical savannas, enhanced benefits of seed dispersal by
   ants would apply for much of the year.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a critical ecosystem process that has played a key role in
   shaping forests throughout the Beartooth Mountains in northwestern
   Wyoming. The highly variable topography of the area provides ideal
   conditions to compare fire regimes across contiguous forest types, yet
   pyro-dendrochronological research in this area is limited. We
   reconstructed fire frequency, tree age structure, and post-fire tree
   growth response in the Clarks Fork Ranger District of the Shoshone
   National Forest to infer variations in historical fire behavior and
   stand effects. We collected fire-scarred trees and plot-based tree ages
   on plots ranging 0.5-5 km(2) in size across two forest types separated
   by 2 km: a lower-elevation forest of mixed Douglas-fir and lodgepole
   pine and a higher elevation treeline forest dominated by whitebark pine.
   Fires occurred in the lower-elevation forest in 1664, 1706, 1785, 1804,
   1846, and 1900 with a mean fire return interval of 47 years. The fires
   in 1804 and 1900 were also recorded in the higher elevation forest, with
   significant tree mortality at high elevation in the 1900 fire. Both
   forests were multi-aged with little evidence of tree cohorts in response
   to severe, stand-replacing events. On average, tree growth increased
   after fires, with mean ringwidths after fire 39\% wider in Douglas-fir
   and 40\% wider in lodgepole pine than pre-fire averages, suggesting that
   some tree mortality likely occurred in association with lowe-relevation
   forest fires. Burns were more frequent in the lower-elevation forest and
   were occasionally able to spread into the upper-elevation whitebark
   stand. Although we suspect the transition of fires from low-to
   high-elevation occurred during drier years, we did not find any
   relationship between fire years and available climatic reconstructions
   via superposed epoch analysis. Regeneration during the 20th Century in
   the whitebark forest documents recovery of this forest after the 1900
   moderate-severity fire event. Finally, especially in the lower-elevation
   Douglas-fir forest, the period since the last recorded fire (1900)
   appears to be longer than any fire-free period in the historical record,
   suggesting that fire exclusion may be creating changes in landscape and
   patch-scale stand structures, which will likely impact future fire
   behavior, especially the extent of crown-replacing fire, in these
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{In arid and semi-arid landscapes around the world, wildfire plays a key
   role in maintaining species diversity. Dominant plant associations may
   depend upon particular fire regime characteristics for their
   persistence. Mountain shrub communities in high-elevation landscapes of
   the Intermountain West, USA, are strongly influenced by the post-fire
   recovery dynamics of the obligate-seeding shrub, mountain big sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. vaseyana {[}Rydb.] Beetle). This
   species is a short-distance disperser with a short-lived seedbank,
   leading to highly variable post-fire recovery times (15-100 years). We
   investigated the relative importance of site productivity and seasonal
   climate in explaining the variance in recovery time for 36 fires,
   comprising a fire chrono-sequence (from 1971 to 2007) for the Great
   Basin and Colorado Plateau. A. t. vaseyana recovery was positively
   related to precipitation in the cool season immediately following fire,
   likely because deep soil-water recharge that persists throughout the
   growing season enhances first-year seedling survival. Percentage sand
   fraction positively correlated with recovery rate yet negatively
   correlated with live cover in unburnt stands. Our data support the
   hypothesis that post-fire recovery rate of A. t. vaseyana depends on the
   climatically controlled ephemerality of the regeneration niche, as is
   likely true for many arid-land shrub species.}},

Abstract = {{The production of plant macroremains was studied in a conifer forest two
   months after it burned in 1996 in northern Quebec. The proportions of
   various types of charred and uncharred pieces (needles, cones and wood)
   produced by black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana)
   were determined by sampling around individual trees. Both species
   produced equivalent masses of charred material, but pieces of wood
   charcoal from jack pine are generally larger that those of black spruce.
   The proportion of charred versus uncharred needles is the best indicator
   of the species dominance in the forest. Although the fall of uncharred
   needles is delayed from the time of a fire, they contribute to more than
   half of all remains produced. Jack pine cones remain on the tree for a
   long time after a fire, while charred cones of black spruce are
   dehiscent (cones come off the branches easily). Trees are poor wood
   charcoal producers compared to undergrowth shrubs. As a result, the
   macroremains assemblage associated with a fire event is made up of large
   amount of uncharred material from trees and a large proportion of
   charred pieces produced by undergrowth vegetation. Modern assemblages of
   plant macroremains indicate that in order to reconstruct past vegetation
   associated with fire disturbance, it is important to distinguish between
   the various types of remains, because wood charcoal is mainly produced
   by material that is already dead.}},

   EFFECTS OF FIRE AND POCKET GOPHERS}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},

Abstract = {{The effects of fire and pocket gophers, Geomys bursarius, on the
   survivorship of Penstemon grandiflorus growing in an oak woodland in
   Minnesota were studied from 1986 to 1990.  Plants growing in sparse
   vegetation experienced mortality rates twice that of plants growing in
   dense vegetation.  This difference was due partly to pocket gophers
   whose earth moving activities reduce the density of vegetation and bury
   and kill individual Penstemon plants.  Laboratory feeding trials showed
   that gophers readily eat Penstemon, particularly the fleshy roots.  An
   experiment involving the removal of 25-75\% of the root tissue in 90
   plants showed that root loss significantly reduced survivorship,
   suggesting that gopher herbivory might also kill plants.  When gophers
   were experimentally excluded, plants growing in sparse vegetation
   exhibited significantly lower mortality rates than those growing in
   dense vegetation.  Plants in the smallest size class exhibited reduced
   survivorship following a late spring burn; however, overall patterns of
   survivorship of plants in burned areas did not differ markedly from
   those in the unburned areas.  A longitudenal analysis of plants with
   different reproductive histories revealed no survivorship cost to
   reproduction.  Mortality rates decreased with increasing plant size. 
   Small plants were more likely to be killed by fire and by being buried
   under gopher mounds.  Differences in underground energy reserves of
   small and large plants can account for most of the survivorship patterns
   observed in this study.  The study shows that within openings of the oak
   woodland, fire and gophers reduce the survival of individual Penstemon
   plants.  Nevertheless, since both gophers and fire also serve to
   perpetuate suitable habitat in the woodland, Penstemon is ultimately
   dependent on both for its long term persistence in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Forest encroachment threatens the biological diversity of grasslands
   globally. Positive feedbacks can reinforce the process, affecting soils
   and ground vegetation, ultimately leading to replacement of grassland by
   forest species. We tested whether restoration treatments (tree removal,
   with or without fire) reversed effects of nearly two centuries of
   encroachment by Abies grandis and Pinus contorta into dry, montane
   meadows in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. In nine, 1-ha plots
   containing a patchy mosaic of meadow openings and forests of varying age
   (20 to > 140 yr), we compared three. treatments affecting the ground
   vegetation: control (no trees removed), unburned (trees removed, slash
   burned in piles leaving 90\% of the area unburned), and burned (trees
   removed, slash broadcast burned). We quantified changes over 3-4 years
   in soils, abundance and richness of species with differing habitat
   associations (meadow, forest, and ruderal), and recruitment of conifers.
   Except for a transient increase in available N (especially in burn
   scars), effects of burning on soils were minimal due, in part, to mixing
   by gophers. Tree removal greatly benefited meadow species at the expense
   of forest herbs. Cover and richness of meadow species increased by 47\%
   and 38\% of initial values in unburned plots, but changed minimally in
   burned plots. In contrast, cover and richness of forest herbs declined
   by 44\% and 26\% in unburned plots and by 79\% and 58\% in burned plots.
   Ruderal species and conifer seedlings were uncommon in both treatments.
   Although vegetation was consumed beneath burn piles, meadow species
   recovered significantly after three years. Long-term tree presence did
   not preclude recovery of meadow species; in fact, colonization was
   greater in older than in younger forests. In sum, temporal trends were
   positive for most indicators, suggesting strong potential for
   restoration. Contrary to conventional wisdom, tree removal without fire
   may be sufficient to shift the balance from forest to meadow species. In
   meadows characterized by historically infrequent fire, small-scale
   disturbances and competitive interactions may be more critical to
   ecosystem maintenance and restoration. Managers facing the worldwide
   phenomenon of tree invasion should critically evaluate the ecological
   vs. operational need for fire in ecosystem restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Obligate seeding species are highly specialized to fire disturbance and
   many conifers such as cypress, which are adapted to high intensity
   stand-replacing fires, have canopy seed banks stored in serotinous
   cones. Resilience of these trees to fire disturbance is a function of
   disturbance frequency and one focus of this study was to determine the
   effect of patch age on postfire recruitment. A second focus was to
   determine the extent to which fire induced a landscape level change in
   the location of the forest boundary. Prior to a fire in 1994, a large
   Cupressus sargentii forest was a mosaic landscape of different aged
   patches of nearly pure cypress bordered by chaparral. Patches less than
   60 years of age were relatively dense with roughly one tree every 1-2
   m(2) but older patches had thinned to one tree every 3-15 m(2). Older
   trees had substantially greater canopy cone crops but the stand level
   seed bank size was not significantly correlated with stand age.
   Fire-dependent obligate seeding species are sensitive to fire return
   interval because of potential changes in the size of seed banks - facing
   both a potential `immaturity risk' and a `senescence risk'. At our site,
   C. sargentii regeneration was substantial in stands as young as 20
   years, suggesting that fire return interval would need to be shorter
   than this to pose any significant risk. Reduced seedling recruitment in
   stands nearly 100 years of age may indicate risk from senescence is
   greater, however, even the lowest density seedling recruitment was many
   times greater than the density of mature forests - thus this cypress
   would appear to be resilient to a wide range of fire return intervals.
   Changes in landscape patterning of forest and chaparral are unlikely
   except after fire. Factors that inhibit tree establishment within the
   shrubland, as well as factors that affect shrub establishment within the
   forest border likely affect the `permeability' of this ecotone. After
   the 1994 fire this boundary appeared to be stable in that cypress
   recruited best within the shadow of burned canopies and cypress were
   weak invaders of adjacent shrublands.}},

   alvar landscape in the Ottawa valley through a comparison of burned and
   unburned alvar woodland. The two adjacent habitats on the same

   butterflies. The sampling was done during 11 visits in 2008 beginning 16
   May and ending 13 September. Both bee and butterfly diversity were
   higher in the post-fire burned alvar woodland compared to the adjacent
   unburned woodland based on species richness, number of individuals and
   Brillouin's Biodiversity Index which takes evenness and heterogeneity
   into account. No bees were captured in the unburned area, but 34 species

   higher vascular plant diversity and much higher cover and frequency
   values for insect-pollinated plants providing nectar and pollen
   including flowering shrubs such as Amelanchier alnifolia var. compacta,
   Arctostaphylos uva-ursi and Prunus virginiana. The burned site also
   provided more cover of larval food plants for butterflies and apparently
   more nesting sites for bees. We suggest that a decrease in fire
   frequency and in the availability of open successional habitats are
   contributing factors in the decline of pollinators, and that endangered
   ecosystems where fire has been a natural phenomenon may require fire or
   fire-simulated management to sustain their biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species can increase fire frequency and intensity, generating
   favorable conditions for their self-perpetuation. Mediterranean
   south-central Chile may be especially prone to the effects of invasive
   species on fire regimes because it is less adapted to fire and it
   contains a highly endemic flora. Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch (syn.
   Cytisus monspessulanus L.; Genista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S. Johnson) is
   an introduced shrub that forms monotypic stands or is present as an
   understory species in native forests as well as in forestry plantations.
   Dense T. monspessulana stands are completely destroyed by fire,
   generating the conditions for it seeds to germinate and establish an
   abundant regeneration, with up to 900 plants/m(2). We report key
   evidence on abundance and biomass in adult stands, and patterns of seed
   bank and regeneration after fire in stands of T. monspessulana around
   the city of Concepcion, Chile. We estimated living biomass in pure
   stands and underneath Eucalyptus plantations. In burned areas, we
   assessed T. monspessulana seed bank and studied regeneration patterns.
   We found that T. monspessulana densities reaches 52,778 plants/ha and
   8.92 ton/ha in pure stands and 34,223 plants/ha and 2.31 ton/ha
   underneath Eucalyptus plantations. T. monspessulana generates small
   caliper fuel and acts as a ladder-fuel. Large soil seed banks allow for
   abundant regeneration after fire, with mean densities of 877,111
   plants/ha, but an overall mortality of 37.2\% in the first year after
   the fire. The high values of regeneration compared to final densities in
   adult stands suggest that density-dependent mortality. Our results
   indicate that T. monspessulana regeneration is not only favored by
   fires, but also that the species creates favorable conditions for
   intense and continuous fires, both under pure conditions, but also
   associated to exotic tree plantations. To understand the implications of
   positive feedbacks between invaders and fire, we recommend focusing in
   the mechanisms by which they increases fuel accumulation and fuel
   flammability, and how higher fire frequency and intensity favors
   invasive species recruitment over native species. Comprehension of this
   dynamics will allow for better management and control of these invasions
   which have major ecological, economical and social implications.}},

Abstract = {{The Croppers Creek paired catchment project was established in 1975 to
   examine the hydrologic effects of conversion of native eucalypt forest
   to pine plantation. In 1980, Clem Creek catchment was converted to
   radiata pine. In 2006, following prolonged severe drought, all
   catchments were burnt by wildfire. The pine plantation was killed and
   the eucalypt forests were scorched. These recovered by producing
   epicormic shoots. Flows from the eucalypt forest catchments were zero
   before the fire; small outflows post-fire may possibly be attributed to
   a cessation of transpiration. The diurnal variation in flow from the
   pine catchment ceased on burning, indicating a cessation of
   transpiration. The outflow from this burnt catchment was similar to the
   pre-bum catchment, despite the death of the pines. In all catchments
   there was a generation of occasional, high ``spike{''} flows as a
   distinct fire effect. Vegetation and transpiration capacity appears to
   have recovered by one year. After three years, fire effects were no
   longer detectable. The data, together with satellite image analysis,
   suggested that the impact of the drought on the hydrology was severe and
   inseparable from the fire effects.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the fire-induced changes in groundwater recharge rate. This
   aspect is particularly important in the case of large forested areas
   growing over a coastal aquifer affected by saltwater intrusion. In the
   Ravenna coastal area (Italy), pine forests grow on coastal dune belts,
   overlying a sandy unconfined aquifer, which is strongly affected by
   marine ingression. Three groundwater profiles across the forest and
   perpendicular to the coastline were monitored for groundwater level,
   physical, and chemical parameters. The aims were to define groundwater
   quality, recharge rate, freshwater volume, and highlight change, which
   occurred after a forest fire with reference to pre-fire conditions.
   Analytical solutions based on Darcy Law and the Dupuit Equation were
   applied to calculate unconfined flow and compare recharge rates among
   the profiles. The estimated recharge rates increased in the partially
   and completely burnt areas (219 and 511mmyear(-1), respectively)
   compared with the pristine pine forest area (73mmyear(-1)). Although
   pre-fire conditions were similar in all monitored profiles, a post-fire
   decrease in salinity was observed across the burnt forest, along with an
   increase in infiltration and freshwater lens thickness. This was
   attributed to decrease canopy interception and evapotranspiration caused
   by vegetation absence after the fire. This research provided an example
   of positive forest fire feedback on the quantity and quality of fresh
   groundwater resources in a lowland coastal aquifer affected by saltwater
   intrusion, with limited availability of freshwater resources. The fire
   provided an opportunity to evaluate a new forest management approach and
   consider the restoration and promotion of native dune herbaceous
   vegetation.}},

Title = {{Threshold peat burn severity breaks evaporation-limiting feedback}},
Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A suite of autogenic ecohydrological feedbacks and moss traits are
   important for protecting vast peatland carbon stocks following wildfire
   disturbance. Here, we examine how peat burn severity and water table
   depth (WTD) affect the strength of one such feedback-the
   hydrophobicity-evaporation feedback (HEF). The HEF is an
   evaporation-limiting feedback known to minimize water loss following
   wildfire. The peatland surface becomes hydrophobic creating an
   evaporative cap and thereby reducing post-fire evaporation; however,
   recent studies hypothesize that this is dependent on peat burn severity.
   To test this hypothesis, we studied plots along a peat burn severity
   gradient in a partially drained black spruce peatland that burned during
   the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. Evaporation rates were
   significantly lower in plots where hydrophobicity was present.
   Hydrophobicity was lowest in the severely burned area, and the average
   instantaneous evaporation rate (2.75 mm day(-1)) was significantly
   higher than moderately and typical-lightly burned areas (0.82 and 1.64
   mm day(-1), respectively). Based on lab results, increasing WTD affected
   hydrophobicity within lightly burned (singed) feather moss samples but
   not in heavily burned feather moss, showing the importance of post-fire
   ground cover and in situ WTD. Our results provide evidence of a burn
   severity threshold where increased depth of burn removes the feather
   moss evaporative cap and causes the HEF to break down. We argue that
   this threshold has important implications for boreal peatlands, which
   are predicted to undergo climate-mediated pre-fire drying and increasing
   burn severities, potentially leading to further carbon losses due to
   enhanced post-fire drying and concomitant decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine fertilizer compound ratios
   suitable for soil conditions and tree seedling growth in recently burned
   areas in Korean forests. Currently, the conventional fertilizer ratio
   applied to undisturbed forests in Korea is N:P:K 3:4:1. In this study,
   Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora S. et Z.) seedlings planted in the
   burned area were fertilized over four growing seasons with the following
   NPK compound ratios: unfertilized (CON), 3:4:1, 6:4:1, 3:8:1, and 3:4:2.
   Fertilization generally increased current-year needle nutrient
   concentrations of the seedlings, and the chlorophyll a:b ratio in CON
   was significantly lower than in all fertilized plots. Fertilization
   significantly affected the growth of the pine seedlings, which had 71-87
   \% more height growth and 29-67 \% increased root collar diameter (RCD)
   compared to CON. The increases in height and RCD were significantly
   higher with the 6:4:1 and 3:8:1 ratios than with the 3:4:1 ratio. The
   3:4:2 and 3:4:1 fertilizer ratios had no effect on the RCD growth of
   seedlings. This suggests that the early growth of pine seedlings could
   be improved by providing high N and P supplies to areas affected by
   forest fires rather than the conventional fertilizer ratio of 3:4:1 in
   Korean forest soils. Therefore, application of the suitable
   fertilization ratio may be a very effective way to reduce reforestation
   cost as well as to shorten restoration period.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fire can modify and accelerate the hydrological response of
   Mediterranean basins submitted to intense rainfall: during the years
   following a fire, the effects on the hydrological response may be
   similar to those produced by the growth of impervious areas. Moreover,
   climate change and global warming in Mediterranean areas can imply
   consequences on both flash flood and fire hazards, by amplifying these
   phenomena. Based on historical events and post-fire experience, a
   methodology to interpret the impacts of forest fire in terms of
   rainfall-runoff model parameters has been proposed. It allows to
   estimate the consequences of forest fire at the watershed scale
   depending on the considered burned area. In a second stage, the combined
   effect of forest fire and climate change has been analysed to map the
   future risk of forest fire and their consequence on flood occurrence.
   This study has been conducted on the Llobregat river basin (Spain), a
   catchment of approximately 5,000 km(2) frequently affected by flash
   floods and forest fires. The results show that forest fire can modify
   the hydrological response at the watershed scale when the burned area is
   significant. Moreover, it has been shown that climate change may
   increase the occurrence of both hazards, and hence, more frequent severe
   flash floods may appear.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical evidence from Australia shows that fuel reduction burning
   significantly reduces the incidence and extent of unplanned fires.
   However, the integration of environmental values into fire management
   operations is not yet well-defined and requires further research and
   development.
   WAVES, a plant growth model that incorporates Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere
   Transfer, was used to simulate the hydrological and ecological effects
   of three fuel management scenarios on a forest ecosystem. WAVES was
   applied using inputs from a set of forest plots for one year after three
   potential scenarios: (1) all litter removed, (2) all litter and 50\% of
   the understorey removed, (3) all litter and understorey removed.
   Modelled outputs were compared with sites modelled with no-fuel
   reduction treatment (Unburnt).
   The key change between unburnt and fuel reduced forests was a
   significant increase in soil moisture after fire. Predictions of the
   recovery of aboveground carbon as plant biomass were driven by model
   structure and thus variability in available light and soil moisture at a
   local scale. Similarly, effects of fuel reduction burning on water
   processes were mainly due to changes in vegetation interception capacity
   (i.e. regrowth) and soil evaporation. Predicted effects of fuel
   reduction burning on total evapotranspiration (ET) - the major component
   of water balance - were marginal and not significant, even though a
   considerable proportion of ET had effectively been transferred from
   understorey to overstorey. In common with many plant growth models,
   outputs from WAVES are dictated by the assumption that overstorey trees
   continue to grow irrespective of their age or stage of maturity. Large
   areas of eucalypt forests and woodlands in SE Australia are well beyond
   their aggrading phase and are instead over-mature. The ability of these
   forests to rapidly respond to greater availability of water remains
   uncertain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that burning of vegetation stimulates new plant growth

   Cyanohydrins have been recently identified in aqueous smoke solutions

   karrikins, a family of butenolides related to 3-methyl-2H-furo{[}2,3-c]
   pyran-2- one. Karrikins stimulate seed germination and influence
   seedling growth. They are active in species not normally associated with
   fire, and in Arabidopsis they require the F-box protein MAX2, which also
   controls responses to strigolactone hormones. We hypothesize that
   chemical similarity between karrikins and strigolactones provided the

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Much recent research has investigated the effects of burning on mature
   black spruce (Picea mariana) forests in interior Alaska, however little
   research has focused on how frequent reburning affects soil organic
   layer (SOL) vulnerability in these ecosystems. We compared organic soil
   layer characteristics in black spruce stands that burned after two
   fire-free intervals (FFI), including an intermediate-interval (37-52
   years) and a more typical long-interval (70-120 years). We found that
   depth of burn varied significantly between intermediate-interval and
   long-interval sites, and as there was less material available to burn in
   intermediate-interval stands, percent depth reduction was greater in
   these stands (78.9\% +/- 2.6\%) than in long-interval stands (62.9\% +/-
   1.5\%). As a result, less residual organic soil carbon remained
   post-fire in intermediate-interval than long-interval stands. Post-fire
   organic soil carbon stocks averaged 0.51 +/- 0.08 kg Cm-2 in the
   intermediate-interval sites, which is less than estimates of soil carbon
   stock for long-interval fire events (ranging from 2.07 to 5.74 kg Cm-2).
   In addition to altering soil carbon storage, a depletion of the SOL
   during more frequent fire events will likely delay the recovery of
   permafrost and could trigger a change in the possible successional
   trajectory of a site, from black spruce dominated to deciduous or even
   shrub dominated ecosystems in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Plant ash derived from fire plays an important role in nutrient balance
   and cycling in ecosystems. Factors that determine the composition and
   availability of ash nutrients include fire intensity (burn temperature
   and duration), plant species, habitat nutrient enrichments and leaf type
   (live or dead leaf). We used laboratory simulation methods to evaluate
   temperature effects on nutrient composition and metals in the residual
   ash of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) and cattail (Typha domingensis),
   particularly on post-fire phosphorus (P) availability in plant ash. Live
   and dead leaf samples were collected from Water Conservation Area 2A in
   the northern Everglades along a soil P gradient, where prescribed fire
   may be used to accelerate recovery of this unique ecosystem. Significant
   decreases in total carbon and total nitrogen were detected with
   increasing fire temperature. Organic matter combustion was nearly
   complete at temperatures >= 450 degrees C. HCl-extractable P (average,
   50\% of total P in the ash) and NH4Cl-extractable P (average, 33\% of
   total P in the ash) were the predominant P fractions for
   laboratory-burned ash. Although a low-intensity fire could induce ail
   elevation of P availability, an intense fire generally resulted in
   decreased water-soluble P. Significant differences in nutrient
   compositions were observed between species, habitat nutrient status, and
   leaf types. More labile inorganic P remained in sawgrass ash than in
   cattail ash; hence, sawgrass ash has a greater potential to release
   available P than cattail. Fire intensity affected plant ash nutrient
   composition, particularly P availability, and the effects varied with
   plant species and leaf type. Therefore, it is important to consider fire
   intensity and vegetation community when using a prescribed fire for

   approaches to sustainable rural development, and climate change
   adaptation and mitigation in West African savannas. However, the
   planning of land management interventions is hindered by the lack of
   information at relevant spatial resolution. We examined predictive
   models for mapping various tree, soil and species diversity attributes
   with a comparison of RapidEye and Landsat imagery. The field data was
   collected in the vicinity of the community-managed forest in southern
   Burkina Faso, where the main environmental threats are agricultural
   expansion and fuelwood extraction. The modelling was done using Random
   Forest algorithm. According to our results, tree crown cover and
   correlated attributes, such as basal area and tree species richness,
   were predicted most accurately. High spatial resolution RapidEye imagery
   provided the best accuracy but difference to medium resolution Landsat
   imagery was negligible for most attributes. Burn scar masked Landsat
   time series performed similar to dry season single date Landsat imagery,
   but the former avoids image selection and mosaicking, and could be less
   sensitive to artifacts due to the burn scars. The presented approach
   provides valuable information on important tree, soil and species
   diversity attributes for spatial planning of land management
   interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   FUELS NEAR BOLES TO PREVENT INJURY}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Fire suppression and other factors have resulted in high wildfire risk
   in the western US, and prescribed burning can be an effective tool for
   thinning forests and reducing fuels to lessen wildfire risks. However,
   prescribed burning sometimes fails to substantially reduce fuels and
   sometimes damages and kills valuable, large trees. This study compared
   fuel reductions between spring and fall prescribed burns and tested
   whether removing ( i. e., raking) fuels within 1 m of boles reduced fire
   damage to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex Lawson \& C.
   Lawson). In 2007 and 2008, raking was applied to alternating trees along
   18 transects in central Oregon, USA. Fuels surrounding 292 trees were
   burned in fall 2010, and fuels surrounding 216 trees were burned in
   spring 2012. Both seasons of burn affected most fuel size classes
   similarly, with one exception being duff, which was more fully consumed
   in fall than in spring. Where fall burning occurred, raking reduced the
   percentage of dead cambium samples from 24.3 +/- 4.9 \% to 6.4 +/- 3.0
   \% ( point estimates +/- 95 \% confidence intervals), in addition to
   reducing bole scorch. Conversely, where spring burning occurred, injury
   of not- raked trees was milder, so raking did not have the potential to
   greatly reduce damage. Redistributing fuels away from boles would be
   more beneficial under relatively dry conditions when duff is prone to
   extensive smoldering. Our study and most other studies suggest that duff
   is, on average, drier in fall than in spring, so raking would tend to
   afford more protection from fall burns than from spring burns. The
   little tree mortality that occurred was split nearly evenly between
   raked trees ( 25) and not- raked trees ( 30), so raking did not
   appreciably increase survival in this study. However, the finding that
   raking reduced injury suggests that it may reduce mortality from more
   intense burns.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of annual burning since 1952, triennial

   (one fire in 61 years) on woody understorey vegetation in a dry

   determined the influence of these treatments, and other site variables
   (rainfall, understorey density, topsoil C : N ratio, tree basal area,
   distance to watercourse and burn coverage) on plant taxa density,
   richness and composition. The richness of woody understorey taxa 0-1min
   height was not affected by burning treatments, but richness of woody
   plants 1-7.5m in height was lower in the annually burnt treatment than
   in the triennially burnt treatment from 1989 to 2007. Fire frequency and
   other site variables explained 34\% of the variation in taxa composition
   (three taxon groups and 10 species), of which 33\% of the explained
   variance was explained by fire treatment and 46\% was explained by other
   site variables. Annual burning between 1974 and 1993 was associated with
   lower understorey densities mainly due to reduced densities of eucalypts
   1-7.5m in height. Triennial burning during the same period was
   associated with higher densities of eucalypts 0-7.5min height relative
   to the annually burnt and unburnt treatments. Most woody taxa persisted
   in the frequently burnt treatments through resprouting mechanisms (e. g.
   lignotuberous regeneration), and fire patchiness associated with
   low-intensity burning was also found to be important. Persistence of
   plants <1 m tall demonstrates the resilience of woody taxa to repeated
   burning in this ecosystem, although they mainly exist in a suppressed
   growth state under annual burning.}},

Abstract = {{Research Highlights: Black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) and trembling
   aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) both regenerated vigorously after
   wildfire. However, pure semi-upland black spruce stands are at
   increasing risk of changing successional trajectories, due to greater
   aspen recruitment. Background and Objectives: Black spruce and aspen are
   found across the boreal forest with black spruce dominating lowlands and
   aspen being common in uplands. Both species are well adapted to wildfire
   with black spruce holding an aerial seedbank while aspen reproduce
   rapidly via root suckering. In the summer of 2016, the Horse River
   wildfire burned 589,617 hectares of northern Alberta's boreal forest.
   Methods: We assessed early regeneration dynamics of both pure aspen and
   pure black spruce forests. For black spruce, 12 plots were established
   in both bog and semi-upland habitats to assess seedling regeneration and
   seedbed availability. For aspen, 12 plots were established in each of
   the low, moderate, and high burn severities, as well as 5 unburned
   plots. Results: Post-fire black spruce regeneration densities did not
   differ between bog and semi-upland habitats, but were positively
   correlated with forb cover and charred organic matter seedbeds. Aspen
   regeneration within pure black sprue stands was substantial,
   particularly in semi-upland habitats, indicating a potential shift in
   successional trajectory. Fire severity did not significantly affect
   aspen regeneration in pure aspen stands, but regeneration density in all
   severity types was >90,000 stems ha(-1). Aspen regeneration densities
   were negatively related to post-fire forb and shrub cover, likely due to
   competition and cooler soil temperature.}},

   or after natural pine seed release could influence changes in
   germination and individuals' early survival by altering the composition
   and structure of these Mediterranean habitats. We ran a seed-sowing
   experiment to analyse the recruitment patterns of three Mediterranean
   pine species (Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra) in three
   sites where prescribed fires were carried out. In each site, we sowed
   one representative pine species according to natural habitats. Three
   treatments (control: sowing without intervention; pre-fire: sowing
   before prescribed fires; and post-fire: sowing after prescribed fires)
   were established. In the sown experiment, we tested two biogeographical
   seed provenances (wetter and drier regions) per species to observe
   different capabilities of adaptation. Germination and survival of
   individuals were monitored during one year. We observed that the
   provenances from drier areas had higher germination and survival rates
   than those from the wetter ones. The three species seemed to undergo a
   negative effect in the burned plots. Within the burned area, the

Abstract = {{Previous research has suggested that prescribed fire will become more
   necessary in the northern Great Plains of the United States as woody
   encroachment and invasive plant species cover increase. Prescribed fire
   will likely become a more frequent management strategy to mimic natural
   processes in grasslands-a combination of fire and grazing. However, the
   amount of research on fire is somewhat lacking since the 1980s, with few
   land managers and producers willing or able to use fire in the western
   half of the northern Great Plains. We evaluated the impact of a wildfire
   in northwest South Dakota on two ecological sites (sandy and shallow
   sandy) and two vegetation types (native rangelands and crested
   wheatgrass pasture lands) to gain more insights into potential fire
   effects by comparing burned with adjacent nonburned sites, as well as
   comparing sites 5 yr prefire and 4 and 16 mo post fire. We collected
   data on plant species composition, bare ground, and biomass production.
   We did not detect any negative effects to the overall plant community,
   but crested wheatgrass did increase on some burned sites 16 mo post
   fire. The most prominent difference between burned and nonburned sites
   was the increase in bare ground and reduced basal litter on burned
   sites, but these changes were undetectable 16 mo after fire. Our results
   suggest mixed-grass prairies in the northern Great Plains are resilient
   to fire, and prescribed fire could be an appropriate management strategy
   when applied at the correct spatial-temporal scale and fire
   prescription. When specific management strategies, like fire, are
   perceived as negative, research has the potential to overcome perception
   and provide more context for land managers and producers on the
   conditions that affect management strategies. (C) 2019 The Society for

   mixed-species/size/age stands in the sustainable management of natural
   forests and woodlands in Africa for diverse timber and non-timber forest
   products and services, and during rehabilitation of degraded forests?
   The evergreen moist tropical to warm-temperate forests, from the equator
   to 34A degrees S, generally function through relative shade tolerance.
   The tropical, strongly seasonal, drier deciduous woodlands generally
   function through adaptation to fire and/or grazing/browsing.
   Silvicultural systems, when implemented, are often not aligned with the
   ecological characteristics of the particular forest systems or the
   specific targeted species. This paper presents the concept of using the
   basic disturbance-recovery processes, with recovery development via
   stand development stages, as the basis for the development of
   silvicultural systems suitable for maintenance of forest complexity.
   Grain analysis and stem diameter distributions, analysed from resource
   inventories, are used to determine the specific shade- or fire-tolerance
   characteristics of key economical and ecological tree species. The
   gained knowledge of the ecosystem and species characteristics (including
   modes of regeneration, i.e. from seed or vegetative regrowth) and
   processes is used to simulate the ecological disturbance-recovery
   processes through the development of mixed silvicultural systems, such
   as a single-tree selection system, a group felling system and a coppice
   management system in the same forest. Very similar concepts are used to
   develop rehabilitation strategies to recover the processes towards
   regrowth stands of diverse species and structure: through stands of
   introduced plantations and invader tree species; and through early
   regrowth stages in deciduous woodlands and evergreen forests, after
   fire, slash-and-burn traditional agriculture, charcoal production or

Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Conifer regeneration failure in the presence of dense ericaceous cover
   resulting from the removal of canopy trees by forest harvesting observed
   in boreal and temperate forest has been attributed to allelopathy,
   competition, and soil nutrient imbalance. Ecosystem-level alleopathic
   effect has been argued as a cause for conifer regeneration failure by
   citing examples from a species-poor boreal forest in northern Sweden
   with ground vegetation dominated by crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum,
   Ericales) and New Zealand dairy pastures invaded by nodding or musk
   thistle (Carduus nutans). This article aims to explain the phenomenon of
   vegetation shift from conifer forest to ericaceous heath by extending
   the argument of ecosystem-level impact of ericaceous plants and linking
   the disturbance-mediated regeneration strategies of the dominant conifer
   species and the understory ericaceous species with the quality of
   seedbed substrate that influence the direction of secondary succession.
   It has been argued that fire severity plays a pivotal role in
   controlling seedbed quality and the regeneration mechanisms of conifers,
   which in turn determines the direction of post-disturbance succession.
   The post-fire-dominated ericaceous plants and their habitat-modifying
   effects have been explained from the point of view of keystone species
   concept and their role as ecosystem engineers. In the absence of high
   severity natural fires the canopy keystone species (conifer) fails to
   regenerate successfully mainly due to limitation of favorable seedbed.
   On the other hand, the understory ericaceous plants regenerate
   vigorously by vegetative methods from the belowground components that
   survived the fire. Forest harvesting by clearcutting or selective
   cutting also create similar vigorous vegetative regrowth of ericaceous
   plants, but conifer regeneration suffers from the lack of a suitable
   seedbed. Thus in the absence of successful conifer regeneration, the
   vigorously growing understory ericaceous plants become the new keystone
   species. The new keystone ericaceous species bring about a significant
   long-term habitat change by rapid accumulation of plyphenol-rich humus.
   Ericaceous phenolic compounds have been found to inhibit seed
   germination and seedling growth of conifers. By forming protein-phenol
   complexes they cause a further reduction of available nitrogen of the
   already nutrient-stressed habitat. A low pH condition in the presence of
   phenolic compounds causes the leaching of metallic ions and forms hard
   iron pans that impair soil water movement. The phenolic allelochemicals
   of ericaceous humus are also inhibitory to many conifer ectomycorrhizae.
   On the other hand, ericaceous plants perpetuate in the community by
   their stress-tolerating strategies as well as their ability to acquire
   nutrients through ericoid mycorrhizae. Three mechanisms working at the
   ecosystem level can be suggested as the cause of vegetation shift from
   forest to ericaceous heath. These are (1) the absence of high severity
   natural fire and the limitation of suitable conifer seedbed in the
   presence of thick humus, (2) increased competition resulting from the
   rapid vegetative regeneration of understory ericaceous plants after
   forest canopy opening by harvesting or nonsevere fire, and (3) habitat
   degradation by phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous plants causing a
   soil nutrient imbalance and iron pan formation. Thus, a shift in
   keystone species from conifer to ericaceous plant in the
   post-disturbance habitat may induce a retrogressive succession due to
   ecosystem-level engineering effects of the new keystone species.
   Vegetation management in conifer-ericaceous communities depends on land
   management objectives. If the objective is to produce timber and other
   forest products then the control of ericaceous plants and site
   preparation is necessary after forest harvesting. Ploughing and liming
   followed by conifer planting and repeated N fertilization has been
   applied successfully to promote afforestation of Calluna heathlands in
   Britain. However, such practice has not been proven successful in the
   reforestation of Kalmia-dominated sites in eastern Canada. If, on the
   other hand, the land management objective is to maintain heathlands for
   herbivore production or conservation of cultural landscape, as in the
   case of certain Calluna-dominated heathland in Western Europe, then
   moderately hot prescribed burning is useful as a management tool.}},

   volume for trees with no crown consumption. For trees with >40\% crown
   consumption volume, linear regression indicates >85\% mortality, but for
   trees with crown consumption volume <40\%, there is a statistically
   significant, linear relationship between increasing crown scorch and
   increasing probability of mortality. Analysis of an independent 600+

Abstract = {{Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) populations are in decline across the
   species' range due to historic wildfire exclusion, mountain pine beetle
   (Dendroctonus ponderosae, MPB) outbreaks, and an invasive fungal
   pathogen causing the disease white pine blister rust (Cronartium
   ribicola, WPBR). Despite reliance on stand-replacing fires, information
   on whitebark pine regeneration occurrence is limited and the trajectory
   of future forests is largely unknown in some areas of the range.
   Regeneration densities were assessed in burned and adjacent non-burned
   areas at six high elevation locations in northwest Wyoming where
   stand-replacing fires occurred 8-32 years before the surveys. In these
   locations at the eastern extent of the species range, we assessed what
   site factors were associated with regeneration success. Whitebark pine
   regeneration density was greater and seedlings were older in non-burned
   compared to burned areas. Within burns, north aspects had more
   regeneration than south aspects. Potential seed source densities and
   other species' regeneration were positively related to whitebark pine
   regeneration densities in burned areas. South facing slopes or grass
   covered areas may have either delayed or no regeneration of whitebark
   pine without the help of artificial planting.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Fire is a primary form of disturbance in boreal ecosystems.
   Charcoal is an important by-product of forest fire and has been reported
   to have the potential to influence the plant community establishing
   after fire. To date, however, no study has effectively tested the
   relationship between charcoal and plant regeneration in the actual
   post-fire forests. To determine the contribution of charcoal to soil
   properties and plant regeneration after forest fires, we conducted in
   situ investigations concerning the relationship between charcoal and the
   plant-soil system.
   Materials and methods We conducted a field investigation in a recently
   burnt Gmelin larch (Larix gmelinii)/Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest
   in the Russian Far East to investigate charcoal contents, pH, water
   contents, and nutrient availability in soil together with the
   regeneration of larch and pine seedlings.
   Results and discussion Positive correlations were found between charcoal
   contents and soil pH, water contents, and available P contents.
   Additionally, charcoal contents and the number of pine seedlings were
   positively correlated. There was, however, no significant relationship
   between charcoal content and extractable NH(4) (+) content or the number
   of larch seedlings. These results suggest that while charcoal influences
   are somewhat obscure in the field, charcoal significantly contributes to
   the amelioration of water and nutrient availability together with the
   success of regeneration of pine seedling.
   Conclusions Charcoal produced during fire events in Gmelin larch and
   Scots pine forests of eastern Russia has a modest influence on soil
   properties, but has the potential to improve regeneration in these
   fire-prone ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Fire management at the landscape scale may be detrimental to threatened
   species restricted to fire refugia, such as riparian zones, if their
   fire response is assumed based on the broader vegetation community type.
   Conserving threatened plant species in fire-prone habitats requires
   understanding how life-history traits allow persistence under prevailing
   fire regimes. Using three threatened Pomaderris species associated with
   riparian zones in south-east Australia, we tested for evidence of
   fire-adapted traits to identify if key life-history traits are coupled
   to specific fire cues and determine how their current distribution
   relates to prevailing fire regimes. We did this by (i) exposing seeds to
   heat-shock treatments with fire-related temperatures (60-100 degrees C)
   in germination trials; (ii) testing for the presence of a soil-stored
   seed bank and its response to fire by using ex-situ experimental burns
   on soil samples and (iii) conducting field surveys of post-fire
   demographic responses for P. adnata. All species showed maximum
   germination following heat-shock treatment at 100 degrees C, strongly
   suggesting adaptation to high severity fire. Seedling emergence from
   soil samples was positively affected by fire for P. bodalla and P.
   walshii, while there was an in situ post-fire germination pulse in P.
   adnata seedling recruitment and moderate increases in resprouting and
   survivorship of mature plants. The study demonstrates that these
   riparian-occurring species have life-history traits that may enable
   persistence under high severity fire and highlights how the possession
   of bet-hedging strategies may allow species to use riparian zones as
   fire refugia in a landscape dominated by an anthropogenically altered
   fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{Fire affects the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM).
   While combustion of the O-horizon causes direct losses of SOM, fire also
   transforms the remaining SOM into a spectrum of thermally altered
   organic matter. Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) can resist degradation and may
   have important effects on soil carbon cycling. The objectives of this
   study are to examine the mobility of PyC. Studying the effects of
   wildfire is challenging due to the rapid post-fire changes in the
   ecosystem and lack of robust controls. We overcame those limitations by
   examining the Chimney Tops 2 Fire which burned 4,617 ha of the Great
   Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSMNP), including a National Ecological
   Observatory Network (NEON) site, in November 2016. We examined PyC in
   soils from three time points from an area burned at low-severity (pre-,
   immediate post-, and 11 months post-fire) and two time points from areas
   burned at lower to higher severity (immediate post- and 11 months
   post-fire). At locations with pre-fire soil samples we found that PyC
   increased in the O-horizon (2.22 g BPCA/kg soil) after low severity
   fire, which resulted in higher PyC concentrations at 5-10 cm (0.73 g
   BPCA/kg soil and 17.79 g BPCA/kg C) and 10-20 cm (12.19 g BPCA/kg C) of
   depth in the mineral soil. Sites burned at higher severity had more PyC
   in the O horizon relative to sites burned at lower severity (10.29 g
   BPCA/kg soil and 29.89 g BPCA/kg C). As a result of higher
   concentrations of PyC in the O-horizons burned at higher severity,
   statistically more PyC moved from the O-horizon to the 0-10 cm horizon
   from immediate to 1-year post-fire (1.37 g BPCA/kg soil and 16.10 g
   BPCA/kg C). Lastly, the depth profile of C and BPCA suggest a shift in
   the source and amount of PyC in these soil profiles over time-possibly
   as a result of fire suppression. Results indicate that low severity fire
   may be an important mechanism by which PyC is produced and transported
   into mineral soils.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2052-2060}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Globally, fire maintains many mesic habitats in an open canopy state by
   killing woody plants while reducing the size of those able to resprout.
   Where fire is frequent, tree saplings are often suppressed by a ``fire
   trap{''} of repeated topkill (death of aerial biomoass) and resprouting,
   preventing them from reaching adult size. The ability to tolerate
   repeated topkill is an essential life-history trait that allows a
   sapling to persist until it experiences a long fire-free interval,
   during which it can escape the fire trap. We hypothesized that
   persistence in the fire trap results from a curvilinear relationship
   between pre-burn size and resprout size, which causes a plant to
   approach an equilibrial size in which post-fire biomass recovery is
   equal to fire-induced biomass loss. We also predicted that the
   equilibrial stem size is positively related to resource availability. To
   test these hypotheses, we collected data on pre-burn and resprout size
   of five woody plant species at wetland ecotones in longleaf pine savanna
   subjected to frequent burning. As expected, all species exhibited
   similar curvilinear relationships between pre-burn size and resprout
   size. The calculated equilibrial sizes were strong predictors of mean
   plant size across species and growing conditions, supporting the
   persistence equilibrium model. An alternative approach using matrix
   models yielded similar results. Resprouting was less vigorous in dry
   sites than at wet sites, resulting in smaller equilibrial stem sizes in
   drier sites; extrapolating these results provides an explanation for the
   absence of these species in xeric uplands. This new framework offers a
   straightforward approach to guide data collection for experimental,
   comparative, and modeling studies of plant persistence and community
   dynamics in frequently burned habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a recurrent phenomenon in Mediterranean ecosystems and
   contributes to soil degradation and desertification, which are partially
   caused by alterations to soil organic matter (SOM). The SOM composition
   from a Cambisol under a Mediterranean forest affected by a wildfire is
   studied in detail in order to assess soil health status and better
   understand of soil recovery after the fire event. The soil was sampled
   one month and twenty-five months after the wildfire. A nearby unburnt
   site was taken as control soil. Soil rehabilitation actions involving
   heavy machinery to remove burnt vegetation were conducted sixteen months
   after the wildfire. Immediately after fire the SOM increased in topsoil
   due to inputs from charred vegetation, whereas a decrease was observed
   in the underlying soil layer. Twenty-five months after fire soil-pH
   increased in fire-affected topsoil due to the presence of ashes, a
   decrease in SOM content was recorded for the burnt topsoil and similar
   trend was observed for the water holding capacity. The
   pyro-chromatograms of burned soils revealed the formation of additional
   aromatic compounds. The thermal cracking of long-chain n-alkanes was
   also detected. Solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy supported the increase
   of aromatic compounds in the fire-affected topsoil due to the
   accumulation of charcoal, whereas the deeper soil sections were not
   affected by the fire. Two years later, soil parameters for the unburnt
   and burnt sites showed comparable values. The reduction of the relative
   intensity in the aromatic C region of the NMR spectra indicated a
   decrease in the charcoal content of the topsoil. Due to the negligible
   slope in the sampling site, the loss of charcoal was explained by the
   post-fire restoration activity, degradation, leaching of pyrogenic SOM
   into deeper soil horizons or wind erosion. Our results support that in
   the Mediterranean region, fire-induced alteration of the SOM is not
   lasting in the long-term. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is often used in upland oak forests to achieve
   objectives related to woodland restoration or oak regeneration. While
   not uncommon for prescriptions to include repeated burning at short fire
   return intervals, long-term frequent fire effects in hardwood forests
   have rarely been quantified. We describe the effects of over 60 years of
   repeated prescribed burning on stand structure and composition in a
   Missouri Ozark oak-hickory forest. Data were collected in 2010 and 2013
   from 40 x 40 m plots arranged in a randomized complete block design with
   two blocks and three treatments: an unburned control (Control), annual
   prescribed fire (Annual; one-year fire return interval), and periodic
   prescribed fire (Periodic; four-year fire return interval). In 2013, the
   diameter distribution of the Control was an exponential decay, whereas
   those in both burn treatments were unimodal. Repeated prescribed
   burning, especially at four-year fire return intervals, reduced
   overstory density and canopy cover and shifted overstory composition
   from a mixture of white oak species, red oak species, and hickories to
   primarily white oak species. Although small-diameter stems were
   top-killed on Periodic plots, resprouting created a dense mid-story of
   small stature saplings. In contrast, Annual plots were virtually void of
   woody seedlings and saplings. There was no apparent tree recruitment on
   either Annual or Periodic plots. The abundance, richness, diversity, and
   evenness of the understory plant community were greater on the burned
   plots than on the Control plots, with forbs dominating the Annual plots
   and woody species dominating the Control plots. Periodic plots included
   a mixture of forbs and woody species, and graminoids were not common in
   any plots. Understory species richness per square meter was nearly three
   times greater on both burn treatments relative to the Control. Our
   results indicate that long-term, repeated prescribed burning can
   approximate woodland conditions. However, the lack of tree recruitment
   suggests that periods without fire are critical for replacing overstory
   trees. Moreover, additional treatments such as mechanical thinning may
   be important for modifying the understory environment to benefit
   graminoids or for reaching management objectives on desirable
   timescales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The premise of this paper is that continued improvement in the
   understanding of wildfire impacts on soil erosion and better prediction
   of resulting hazards can be best achieved by adopting a concept of
   global regional variants and endemic factors that distinguish some
   regions in terms of post-fire erosion characteristics. The need for such
   an approach is exemplified here based on the fire-prone eucalypt forests
   in south-east Australia. Wildfire effects on vegetation, fauna, soil
   erodibility and erosion in this environment are evaluated and placed in
   the context of the global state-of-the-art for forest environments. In
   addition to expected variation resulting from, for example, geology,
   topography and climate of the area, it is argued that a distinctive
   post-fire behaviour is caused in these eucalypt forests by the
   interaction between specific characteristics of the vegetation, litter,
   soil properties, faunal activity and micro-scale surface features. Soil
   erosion limited only by post-fire rainfall intensity and quantity, or
   until bedrock is exposed, might be expected after wildfire on steep
   slopes in these forests given the non-cohesive character of the often
   sandy soils and their universally water repellent character. That this
   scenario is not realised, except possibly under extreme rainfall
   conditions, which rarely occur during the vulnerable post-fire period,
   can be attributed to a unique suite of features that disrupt or provide
   sinks for overland flow, bind the loose in situ soil and trap mobilised
   sediment. These include mats of fine roots, litter dam-microterrace
   complexes and faunal activity by small mammals and ants. In combination,
   these characteristics reduce post-fire hillslope-channel sediment
   transfer, at least under light to moderate intensity rainfall typical of
   post-fire periods following recent wildfires. Evidence is discussed
   suggesting that the long-term geomorphological role of wildfires in
   south-east Australia may be of relatively minor importance and confined
   largely to enhanced weathering of exposed outcrops and redistribution of
   soil across existing erosional and depositional landforms. The soil
   fertility and downstream water quality implications of widespread
   transfer of topsoil to watercourses resulting from frequent, often
   severe wildfires are nevertheless significant. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Avast area (more than 100 000 ha) of forest, shrubs and agricultural
   land burned on the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece during the 2007
   summer. Three pre- and post-fire differenced Landsat Thematic Mapper

   severity for these devastating fires. These spectral indices were the
   Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalised Difference
   Moisture Index (NDMI) and the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR). The field
   data consist of 160 Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) plots. In
   addition, indices were evaluated in terms of optimality. The optimality
   statistic is a measure for the index's sensitivity to fire-induced
   vegetation depletion. Results show that the GeoCBI-dNBR (differenced
   NBR) approach yields a moderately high R(2) = 0.65 whereas the
   correlation between field data and the differenced NDMI (dNDMI) and the
   differenced NDVI (dNDVI) was clearly lower (respectively R(2) = 0.50 and
   R(2) = 0.46). The dNBR also outperformed the dNDMI and dNDVI in terms of

   the median dNDMI and dNDVI optimality values were respectively 0.50 and
   0.40 (differences significant for P < 0.001). However, inaccuracies
   observed in the spectral indices approach indicate that there is room

Abstract = {{Land-use change has been one of the main drivers of landscape changes in
   the Mediterranean region during the last decades. Many of the formerly
   intensively cultivated or grazed areas were converted to forest and
   wilderness through afforestation or abandonment. Understanding the
   threats to such lands in their process of recovery to less intensively
   managed systems is important to have a proper understanding of the
   effects of land-use change on the ecosystem. Our aim was to determine
   how land-use history could affect postfire vegetation. In 1986, a large
   fire occurred in Sierra de Gredos (Central Spain) and affected an area
   of 6652 ha which had had different land-use histories in the preceding
   decades. Land-use history was reconstructed from aerial photographs
   taken in 1956, 1972 and 1982. Within the crown-fire area of the burn, we
   chose areas that were cultivated, abandoned (matorral) or pine (Pinus
   pinaster) woodlands in 1956. Their status was later assessed in 1972 and
   in 1982. We selected three groups of plots that underwent different
   types of land-use history: that had not changed since 1956, or that
   changed in land-use type between 1956 and 1972, or between 1972 and
   1982. Only two land-use types were considered in 1982: abandoned land
   (i.e. matorral) and pine woodland. Plots remained like this until 1986
   when they burned. Five years after the fire vegetation was sampled: at
   each plot, shrubby plants were measured on 10 5 m transects, and
   herbaceous plants were measured on 50 30 cm x 30 cm squares regularly
   distributed within the transects. The effect of land-use history on the
   postfire vegetation was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and a posteriori
   multiple comparisons. After the fire, the shrubby vegetation was
   dominated by the legume Cytisus striatus subsp. eriocarpus. P. pinaster
   was very scarce. The herbaceous flora was composed of mostly annual
   species of Gramirieae, Compositae and Leguminosae. The abundance of
   shrubs or herbs was not significantly different among different land-use
   histories. Similar results were obtained when species richness was
   analyzed, except that plots burned as matorral developed a greater
   abundance of hemicryptophytes, and less of herbaceous legumes. Plots
   that had been cultivated had a richer flora of annuals than those that
   remained matorral for a longer time. Overall, the recent land-use
   history accounted for few effects on the structure and composition of
   this plant community. Fires may act as a homogenizing agent of
   vegetation and, therefore, could further contribute to increase fire
   hazard. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The causes of bark beetle outbreaks - particularly the role of
   disturbances - are poorly understood. Stand-scale disturbances, like
   fires, can suddenly improve local host susceptibility and may attract
   beetles; however, whether such increases can lead to outbreaks in
   post-disturbance stands is unclear. Using low-density Dendroctonus
   ponderosae mountain pine beetle populations in Pinus contorta lodgepole
   pine forests in western Canada, we investigated whether prescribed fires
   promote outbreaks or provide only short-term resources. Proportionally
   more burned than non-burned trees were attacked. At one site, beetle
   attacks increased in response to a resource pulse, but the proportions
   of attacked trees and numbers of attacks per tree declined over
   fouryears after fire. Elsewhere, beetle attacks remained very low. As
   the resource (phloem) quality of burned trees remained high threeyears
   after fire, we propose that post-fire mortality, resulting in fewer
   available host trees, can at least partially explain why D.ponderosae
   did not build up populations in burned stands.Synthesis and
   applications. Our study emphasizes the importance of examining long-term
   trends in fire-bark beetle interactions, and of understanding
   low-density beetle populations. Because fire does not seem to promote
   mountain pine beetle outbreaks, we recommend the continued use of
   prescribed fire for the general management of P. contorta forests with
   low-density beetle populations.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Rising temperatures and more frequent and severe droughts are driving
   increases in tree mortality in forests around the globe. However, in
   many cases, the likely trajectories of forest recovery following
   drought-related mortality are poorly understood. In many fire-suppressed
   western U.S. forests, management is applied to reverse densification and
   restore natural forest structure and species composition, but it is
   unclear how such management affects post-mortality recovery. We
   addressed these uncertainties by examining forest stands that
   experienced mortality during the severe drought of 2012-2016 in
   California, USA. We surveyed post-drought vegetation along a gradient of
   overstory mortality severity in paired treated (mechanically thinned or
   prescribed-burned) and untreated areas in the Sierra Nevada. Treatment
   substantially reduced tree density, particularly in smaller tree size
   classes, and these effects persisted through severe drought-related
   overstory mortality. However, even in treated areas with severe
   mortality (>67\% basal area mortality), the combined density of residual
   (surviving) trees (mean 44 trees/ha) and saplings (mean 189 saplings/ha)
   frequently (86\% of plots) fell within or exceeded the natural range of
   variation (NRV) of tree density, suggesting little need for
   reforestation intervention to increase density. Residual tree densities
   in untreated high-mortality plots were significantly higher (mean 192
   trees/ha and 506 saplings/ha), and 96\% of these plots met or exceeded
   the NRV. Treatment disproportionately removed shade-tolerant conifer
   species, while mortality in the drought event was concentrated in pines
   (Pinus ponderosa and P. lambertiana); as a consequence, the residual
   trees, saplings, and seedlings in treated areas, particularly those that
   had experienced moderate or high drought-related mortality, were more
   heavily dominated by broadleaf ({''}hardwood{''}) trees (particularly
   Quercus kelloggii and Q. chrysolepis). In contrast, residual trees and
   regeneration in untreated stands were heavily dominated by
   shade-tolerant conifer species (Abies concolor and Calocedrus
   decurrens), suggesting a need for future treatment. Because increased
   dominance of hardwoods brings benefits for plant and animal diversity
   and stand resilience, the ecological advantages of mechanical thinning
   and prescribed fire treatments may, depending on the management
   perspective, extend even to stands that ultimately experience high
   drought-related mortality following treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Cyprus, an island located in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, was

   Cyprus' forests is Pinus brutia, which has been planted extensively on
   abandoned agricultural lands and areas burned by wildfire. P. brutia
   forests are subject to periodic wildfire episodes. In addition, young
   plantations are subject to defoliation by the pine processionary
   caterpillar, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera: Pityocampidae), and
   older forests are subject to attack by several species of bark beetles

   most likely, result in continued problems with wildfire, pine
   processionary caterpillar and bark beetles in the foreseeable future.

   plant and bird community composition and species richness across
   unburned, low-, moderate-, and high-severity burn patches in a
   27-year-old mixed-severity wildfire that had received minimal post-fire

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of a wildfire on stream physical, chemical

   lower and water temperature was higher in streams draining basins where
   the riparian vegetation burned than in streams in unburned basins or
   burned basins where riparian vegetation remained intact. Stream flow and
   suspended sediment concentrations during large post-fire storms and wet
   season nutrient levels were higher in burned than unburned catchments,
   with increased sedimentation after flood peaks. A year after fires,
   algal levels were highest in streams where riparian vegetation burned
   and lowest in streams in burned basins where the riparian canopy
   remained intact. In contrast, streams in burned basins had lower
   particulate organic matter, detritivore and predator levels than
   unburned basins, regardless of whether riparian vegetation burned. Where
   present, southern California steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were
   extirpated from burned basins. Algivore densities were high in streams

   to unburned stream levels. Shredder densities rebounded in streams in
   burned basins with intact riparian vegetation, but remained low for
   4years where riparian vegetation burned. Predatory invertebrate

   Hydrogen stable isotope analysis indicated that the diets of most

   burned riparian canopies supported algal-based food webs and streams
   with intact riparian canopies sustained detrital-based food webs. Fire
   affected basal resources (nutrients, light, allochthonous inputs) with

Abstract = {{Understanding vegetation recovery patterns following wildfire and

   forestry. Plot-scale studies indicate differences in revegetation rates
   and postdisturbance composition in Labrador, Canada, following fire in
   comparison with harvest but do not necessarily capture the full range of
   relevant landscape variability. Using a satellite-based land cover
   classification that distinguishes forest, woodland, shrub, lichen, and
   bare ground, we applied partial least-squared regression (PLS) to derive
   empirical models of vegetation dynamics following fire and harvest.
   Forest recovery rates were found to be generally slow and sensitive to
   predisturbance land condition and site quality (potential productivity).
   We found that, although disturbance type was not specifically retained
   in the model, estimated rates of vegetation recovery were faster for a
   typical harvest compared with a typical fire (i.e., 50\% recovery at 14
   years versus 33 years, respectively). Indeed, the model predicts
   important regeneration delay following fire that appears sensitive to
   both site quality and area burned. Understanding factors affecting
   broad-scale vegetation recovery relationships can help guide future
   sustainable forestry and wildlife habitat initiatives in the region, in
   part by parameterizing landscape simulation models used for strategic

   This study compared the soil erosion predicted by the RUSLE and the
   revised MMF model with the observed values of soil losses, for the first
   year following fire, in two burned areas in NW of Spain with different
   levels of fire severity. The applicability of both models to estimate
   soil losses after three rehabilitation treatments applied in a severely
   burned area was also tested.
   The MMF model presented reasonable accuracy in the predictions while the
   RUSLE clearly overestimated the observed erosion rates. When the R and C
   factors obtained by the RUSLE formulation were multiplied by 0.7 and
   0.865, respectively, the efficiency of the equation improved.
   Both models showed their capability to be used as operational tools to
   help managers to determine action priorities in areas of high risk of
   degradation by erosion after fire. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Hollow-using fauna are thought to be particularly vulnerable to timber
   harvesting, and habitat for these species is often managed by retaining
   single hollow-bearing trees or patches of hollow-bearing trees within
   the harvested area. This study examined tree retention, survival and use
   by arboreal mammals in 27 small clumps of trees (0.04-0.21 ha) retained
   at ten partial harvest sites and 24 clumps of trees in nearby
   unharvested sites in Tasmania, Australia. Harvested sites were assessed
   on three occasions (1999, 2005-06 and 2014) and unharvested sites on two
   occasions (2005-06 and 2014). Of the retained clumps in harvested areas,
   96\% contained at least two habitat trees at the time of first survey
   (one year after harvest) which is the minimum required under the
   Tasmanian Forest Practices Code. Loss of retained trees in clumps
   between 2005-06 and 2014 was higher in harvested sites (average of
   11.7\% of all trees and 1.5\% of habitat trees per clump) than
   unharvested sites (average of 2.8\% of all trees and 0.3\% of habitat
   trees per clump), but was comparable to or lower than rates of loss in
   many other studies. Trees were more likely to fall if they were dead and
   had little burn damage at the time of last survey. Factors found to
   influence tree death included the interaction between burn damage and
   the size of the tree, with the likelihood of a heavily burnt, average
   sized tree dying being twice that of an unburnt tree. Scratch marks from
   arboreal mammals were more prevalent in large trees with visible
   hollows, particularly in the clumps in harvested areas. In conclusion,
   the Tasmanian Forest Practices Code provisions were generally
   implemented as required and the evidence suggests the retained clumps of
   trees survive and are effective to some degree at providing habitat and
   promoting recolonisation by fauna in partial harvest coupes. However,
   further work is required to assess the adequacy of the clump provisions,
   when combined with management for other values in production forests,
   for maintaining hollow-using fauna throughout their range.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{378}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Many recent wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson \& C.
   Lawson) - dominated forests of the western United States have burned
   more severely than historical ones, generating concern about forest
   resilience. This concern stems from uncertainty about the ability of
   ponderosa pine and other co-occurring conifers to regenerate in areas
   where no surviving trees remain. We collected post-fire conifer
   regeneration and other data within and surrounding five 11-18 year-old
   Colorado Front Range wildfires to examine whether high severity burn
   areas (i.e., areas without surviving trees) are regenerating, and how
   regeneration density is related to abiotic and biotic factors such as
   distance from surviving forest, elevation, and aspect. We found that
   some conifer regeneration has occurred in high severity burn areas (mean
   and median of 118 and 0 stems ha(-1), respectively), but at densities
   that were considerably lower than those in unburned and in low to
   moderate severity burn areas. Generalized estimating equation analyses
   revealed that distance from surviving forest was the most important
   predictor of conifer regeneration in high severity burn areas, with
   regeneration declining as distance from surviving forest increased;
   estimates of conifer regeneration were 211 stems ha(-1) immediately
   adjacent to surviving forest but only 10 stems ha(-1) 200 m from
   surviving forest. These analyses also revealed that conifer regeneration
   densities declined as elevation decreased. Regression tree analyses
   likewise showed that distance from surviving forest and elevation were
   important predictors of conifer regeneration in high severity burn
   areas; within 50 m of surviving forest mean (median) regeneration was
   150 (0) stems ha(-1) at elevations <= 2490 m and 1120 (1000) stems
   ha(-1) at elevations >2490 m, but at distances >= 50 m from surviving
   forest mean (median) regeneration was only 49 (0) stems ha(-1),
   regardless of elevation. Applying regression tree results spatially to
   the 2002 Hayman Fire, Colorado's largest and most severe known wildfire,
   we found that 70\% of the area without surviving forest exceeded this 50
   m threshold. These patterns of conifer regeneration suggest that
   Colorado Front Range ponderosa pine-dominated forests may not be
   resilient to high severity wildfire, particularly where surviving forest
   is not in close proximity. We recommend that land managers consider
   planting conifers within the interiors of large high severity burn
   patches, as well as implementing treatments to reduce the risk of
   uncharacteristic high severity wildfire in unburned forests, where
   maintaining a forested condition is desired. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of fire on the vegetative phenological behavior

   the hypothesis that: 1) fire damages total foliage cover, thus leading
   to changes in vegetative phenological patterns. As this hypothesis was
   corroborated, we also tested whether 2) the damage caused by fire to the
   total crown foliage cover and mature leaves is greater in evergreen than
   in deciduous species, and 3) the negative effects of fire on vegetative
   phenology persist after the first fire-free year. The first two
   hypotheses were corroborated, but the third was not. Fire effects on
   total crown foliage cover and mature leaves were greatest during the
   first three months following the fire, and were significantly greater in
   evergreen species. For shoots and young leaves, the greatest differences
   found between three and seven months post-fire. On the other hand, no
   differences were observed in phenological events between burned and
   unburned sites in the second year post-fire, indicating that marked
   effects of the fire were only observed over a short period. Our results

Abstract = {{Few studies have focused on the actual extent and spatial patterns of
   browsing in relation to forest restoration, especially when browsing is
   done by deer with conservation status. Here, we present data from three
   forest restoration experiments located in priority forests for
   restoration in Chiloe Island in Chile. The aim of this study is to
   report evidence of browsing of the southern pudu (Pudu puda), a native
   and Near Threatened deer species. We visually assessed browsing for all
   individual seedlings and calculated the average browsing extent per plot
   and treatment. Since pudus as well as other deer species are known to
   preferably feed in open spaces, we hypothesized that Pilgerodendron
   uviferum planted seedlings will present higher browsing rates in places
   with lower shrub cover (bogs) and canopy cover (upland areas) (H1). In
   the case of degraded North-Patagonian forests we hypothesized that
   Nothofagus nitida planted seedlings will present higher browsing rates
   in places with higher \%PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) and/or
   lower residual basal area (H2). Our results indicate that browsing
   ranged from 9.3\% up to 84.0\% depending on tree species and site
   condition. In burned forests, browsing was significantly higher (p <
   0.01) when shrubs were removed (84.0\% +/- 9.9) than by retaining them
   (68.9\% +/- 11.6). In degraded old-growth forests, we found
   significantly higher browsing in places with higher degradation (p <
   0.05). Furthermore, \% PPFD was significantly correlated with browsing
   (rho: 0.535; p < 0.01). Based on our results, forest restoration efforts
   in Chiloe Island will face a great challenge in balancing the protection
   of Near Threatened wildlife and the restoration of tree species with
   conservation problems, especially in open/disturbed areas, where higher
   browsing was found.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important ecological disturbance factor in most
   Mediterranean ecosystems. In the Mediterranean Basin, most shrub species
   can regenerate after fire by resprouting or seeding. Here, we
   hypothesize that post-fire regenerative syndromes may potentially
   co-vary with traits directly related to functional properties involved
   in resource use. Thus, seeders with a shorter life span and smaller size
   would have lower water-use efficiency (WUE) than re-sprouting species
   and would take up nutrients such as nitrogen from more superficial parts
   of the soil. To test this hypothesis, we compared leaf 13C and 15N
   signatures from 29 co-existing species with different post-fire
   regeneration strategies. We also considered life form as an additional
   explanatory variable of the differences between post-fire regenerative
   groups. Our data support the hypothesis that seeder species (which
   mostly evolved in the Quaternary under a Mediterranean climate) have
   lower WUE and less stomatal control than non-seeders (many of which
   evolved under different climatic conditions in the Tertiary) and
   consequently greater consumption of water per unit biomass. This would
   be related to their smaller life forms, which tend to have lower WUE and
   shorter life and leaf lifespan. Differences in 15N also support the
   hypothesis that resprouters have deeper root systems than
   non-resprouters. The study supports the hypothesis of an overlap between
   plant functional traits and plant attributes describing post-disturbance
   resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire forest resilience must be quantified in a long-term
   perspective considering changes in land-use related to fire dynamics.
   Historical land-use changes leading to increased wildfire severity may

   paleoecological proxies, historical fire records and tree-ring width
   data of relict Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii forests in the Sierra de
   Gredos (central Spain). A high incidence of historical fires was
   recorded in the 1890s, coinciding with a peak in charcoal accumulation
   rates and a sharp decrease in pollen of P. nigra/Pinus sylvestris with a
   rapid increase of pollen of more flammable Pinus pinaster and shrubs.
   The shift observed in pollen assemblages, coupled with a peak in
   charcoal influx, support the occurrence of high-severity fires during
   the 1890s, when abrupt growth suppressions were observed. Trees took 2
   years to recover to their pre-fire growth rates. Lasting growth-recovery
   periods or no growth suppression were observed in the 1920s and 1980s,
   when fire frequency was also high but the study sites were fragmented or

   forest floor and soil, bark beetles, tree diseases and wildlife were
   measured in 10-ha stands, and ecological response was compared among
   treatments at the site level, and across sites, to better understand the
   influence of differential site conditions. For most sites, treated
   stands were predicted to be more resilient to wildfire if it occurred
   shortly after treatment, but for most ecological variables, short-term
   response to treatments was subtle and transient. Strong site-specificity

   that practitioners employ adaptive management at the local scale.
   Because ecosystem components were tightly linked, adaptive management
   would need to include monitoring of a carefully chosen set of key

   Experiments in one field inlcuded: different intensities of initial

   a burn of normal intensity (1.4 plants m-2). Weeding and prolonged
   cultivation strongly reduced species diversity but plant densities were
   less affected because some climbers and trees were apparently stimulated

   Fields abandoned after one rice harvest had, within six months, a closed
   forest canopy of pioneer trees emerging from the pre-existing seed bank

Abstract = {{In fire-prone regions, wildfire influences spatial and temporal patterns
   of landscape heterogeneity. The likely impacts of climate change on the
   frequency and intensity of wildfire highlights the importance of
   understanding how fire-induced heterogeneity may affect different
   components of the biota. Here, we examine the influence of wildfire, as
   an agent of landscape heterogeneity, on the distribution of arboreal
   mammals in fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia. First, we used
   a stratified design to examine the role of topography, and the relative
   influence of fire severity and fire history, on the occurrence of
   arboreal mammals 2-3 years after wildfire. Second, we investigated the
   influence of landscape context on the occurrence of arboreal mammals at
   severely burnt sites. Forested gullies supported a higher abundance of
   arboreal mammals than slopes. Fire severity was the strongest influence,
   with abundance lower at severely burnt than unburnt sites. The
   occurrence of mammals at severely burned sites was influenced by
   landscape context: abundance increased with increasing amount of unburnt
   and understorey-only burnt forest within a 1 km radius. These results
   support the hypothesis that unburnt forest and moist gullies can serve
   as refuges for fauna in the post-fire environment and assist
   recolonization of severely burned forest. They highlight the importance
   of spatial heterogeneity created by wildfire and the need to incorporate

   prominent invading species, and affected tree growth, particularly on
   the sidecast, by shading and crowding the trees. Black huckleberry,
   regenerating from root stalks, was common on the burned sites, but had
   marginal influence on Engelmann spruce development over 5 years. The
   best tree growth occurred on the burned sites, followed by the sidecast,

   the cutbank planting site and moving the mid-trail planting site inward
   on slopes of 30\% or more.}},

Abstract = {{1. Climate change may increase the occurrence of droughts and fires in
   the Amazon. Most of our understanding on how fire affects tropical
   ecosystems is based on studies of non flooded forest-savanna ecotones.
   Nonetheless, tropical floodplain forests in the Amazon can burn severely
   during extreme droughts. The mechanisms slowing down forest regeneration
   in these ecosystems remain poorly understood and have never been
   assessed in the field.
   2. We studied the recovery of Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests
   after one and two fire events. We used Landsat images to map fire
   history and conducted field surveys to measure forest structure, tree
   species richness, tree seed bank and post-lire invasion of herbaceous
   plants.
   3. Sites burnt once had on average 0\% trees, 6\% tree seed abundance,
   23\% tree seed species richness and 8 10 root mat thickness compared to
   unburnt forests. In contrast, herbaceous cover increased from 0 to 72\%.
   Nonetheless, forest structure and diversity recovered slowly towards
   pre-burn levels, except for tree seed banks that remained depleted even
   15 years after fire.
   4. Sites burnt twice had on average 0\% trees, 1\% tree seed abundance,
   3\% tree seed species richness and 1\% root mat thickness compared to
   unburnt forests. Herbaceous cover increased to 100\%. Mean recovery of
   tree basal area was 50\% slower and of root mat thickness 93\% slower
   compared to recovery in sites burnt once. Tree seed banks did not
   recover at all, and herbaceous cover persisted close to 100\% for more
   than 20 years after the second fire.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that after a second
   fire event. Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests lose their recovery
   capacity, and persist in a non-forested state dominated by herbaceous
   vegetation. Such fragility, implies that preventing human ignited fires
   during drought episodes is a particularly, important conservation
   strategy for these ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Large and severe wildfires are now widespread in the Mediterranean
   Basin. Fire severity is important to ecosystem properties and processes
   and to forest management but it has been neglected by wildland fire
   research in Europe. In this study, we compare fire severity between
   maritime pine (PS) woodland and other forest (OF) types, identify other
   variables influent on fire severity, and describe its variation. We
   sampled contiguous, paired stands of PS and OF cover types - including
   deciduous and evergreen broadleaves and short-needled mountain conifers
   - that burned under very high to extreme fire danger in northwestern
   Portugal. Data on stand characteristics and fire severity metrics were
   collected in plots along transects perpendicular to the PS-OF boundary.
   Fire severity was rated in separate for the tree canopy, understorey
   vegetation and forest floor layers, and then an average (composite) fire
   severity rating was calculated. Fire intensity inferred from stem char
   height (adjusted for the effects of other factors) was highest in PS,
   followed by deciduous broadleaved woodland and short-needled conifer
   forest. With a few exceptions, all fire severity ratings were
   significantly different between PS and OF at all sites. Most fire
   severity metrics and ratings were correlated. The distance for fire
   severity minimization did not differ between OF types (median = 21 m).
   Variation in composite fire severity was accounted for by a
   classification tree (R-2 = 0.44) based on cover type (contributing with
   51\% to the overall explanation), stand variables, aspect, distance to
   the PS-OF edge and fire spread pattern. Except for a more immediate
   decline in deciduous broadleaves, fire severity rating was not affected
   by OF type and tended to decrease in more mature stands and moister
   aspects. The fire severity moderation from PS to OF was compounded by a
   dominant pattern of down slope fire propagation into moister
   topographical positions, exacerbating the fuel effect implicit in the
   cover type change. The results are consistent with fire hazard and fire
   incidence studies and support conventional knowledge that advocates the
   expansion of broadleaved deciduous or evergreen forest as a means to
   achieve more fire-resilient ecosystems and landscapes. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Plant invasions can increase fire frequency in desert ecosystems where
   fires were historically infrequent. Although there are many resource
   management concerns associated with high frequency fire in deserts,
   fundamental effects on plant community characteristics remain largely
   unstudied. Here I describe the effects of fire frequency on creosote
   bush scrub vegetation in the Mojave Desert, USA. Biomass of the invasive
   annual grass Bromus rubens L. increased following fire, but did not
   increase further with additional fires. In contrast, density, cover and
   species richness of native perennial plants each decreased following
   fire and continued to decrease with subsequent fires, although not as
   dramatically as after the initial fire. Responses were similar 5 and 14
   years post-fire, except that cover of Hymenoclea salsola Torr.\& A. Gray
   and Achnatherum speciosa Trin. \& Rupr. both increased in areas burnt
   once. These results suggest that control of B. rubens may be equally
   warranted after one, two or three fires, but revegetation of native
   perennial plants is most warranted following multiple fires. These
   results are valid within the scope of this study, which is defined as
   relatively short term vegetation responses (<= 14 years) to short fire

Abstract = {{The current paper presents a study on the interaction between land
   abandonment and soil responses to fire in old agricultural terraced
   landscapes. The study area, located near the Guadalest reservoir (E
   Spain), was partially affected by a forest fire in August 1998. We
   monitored burned and unburned areas as well as two pre-fire stand ages
   since agricultural abandonment: 8-15 years (dry grassland with young
   Pinus halepensis) and > 35 years (mature pine forest). We analysed soil
   surface structure, water repellency and infiltrability, and we monitored
   plant response, runoff and sediment production for a period of 7 years
   after the fire. Aggregate stability increased with both
   time-since-abandonment and fire. Water repellency increased with land
   abandonment but was not affected by fire. Unburned erosion plots
   produced almost no runoff, even during heavy rainstorms. Fire scarcely
   modified runoff and erosion rates in recently abandoned terraces. A dry
   period following fire restricted plant recovery in burned pine forest.
   Burned forest plots registered runoff and sediment yields one to four
   orders of magnitude higher than unburned forest plots. In burned pine
   forest, the maximum sediment production was registered 3 years after the
   fire, when rainstorms took place and plant cover was still low. Old
   agricultural terraces colonised by pines were found to be both
   vulnerable to degradation as a consequence of fire and highly dependent
   on post-fire rain for their recovery.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{58-67}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring is a critical component of ecological restoration and
   requires the use of metrics that are meaningful and interpretable. We
   analyzed the effectiveness of the Floristic Quality Index (FQI), a
   vegetative community metric based on species richness and the level of
   sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance of individual species present
   (Coefficient of Conservatism (CC)), using ground layer vegetation data
   from forests and woodlands with different fire histories in the Missouri
   Ozarks, USA. Specifically, we used total species richness, mean CC, and
   FQI to quantify differences in ground layer vegetation between burned
   and unburned sites, determine if relationships between richness and mean
   CC were consistent at local and landscape-scales, and evaluate the
   influence of richness and mean CC on FQI values using empirical data.
   Concerns regarding FQI identified in previous studies were also observed
   in this study, including a negative relationship between richness and
   mean CC. However, we observed this negative relationship using data from
   all study plots (landscape-scale) but not within discrete site types
   (local-scale). Relationships among mean CC, richness, and FQI were
   complicated because species richness was strongly correlated to FQI
   values across plots in which richness was low, whereas mean CC was only
   correlated with FQI. values across plots in which richness was high. We
   conclude that the interpretation of the Floristic Quality Index may be
   challenged by: (1) the possibility of obtaining the same FQI value
   through different combinations of mean CC and richness; and (2) the
   dominating effect of richness on FQI. Although the FQI metric appears
   responsive to prescribed fire effects on plant communities in the
   Missouri Ozarks, the inclusion of species richness and mean CC provide
   more complete indication of plant community response than FQI alone. (C)

Abstract = {{This study compares the succession of understorey vegetation at

   young, mature and over-mature/old-growth forests. The coverage and
   number of species representing ground lichens, mosses, liverworts,
   grasses, herbs, dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings were recorded and
   analysed separately. The vegetation represented different stages of the
   succession and management history (managed versus semi-natural).
   The vegetation was ordered along two multivariate (DCA) axes, the first
   related to successional stage and the second to human influence. The
   total number of plant species was dependent on the successional stage
   and the diversity pattern was similar both after semi-natural and
   man-made disturbance. The plant life-form groups exhibited specific
   patterns in their occurrence and in their responses to natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances. The coverage of grasses and dwarf shrubs, in
   particular, followed quite different patterns after man-made and natural
   disturbances. Grasses were abundant in managed forests after
   clear-cutting, but almost absent from young natural forests, while dwarf
   shrubs occurred more commonly in the old managed forests than in the
   younger ones. The coverage of seedlings in semi-natural forests peaked
   in the sapling stage, decreased towards the mature stage and increased
   again in the old-growth stage, while tree recruitment was relatively low

Abstract = {{A capacity to predict the effects of fire on biota is critical for
   conservation in fire-prone regions as it assists managers to anticipate
   the outcomes of different approaches to fire management. The task is
   complicated because species' responses to fire can vary geographically.
   This poses challenges, both for conceptual understanding of post-fire
   succession and fire management. We examine two hypotheses for why
   species may display geographically varying responses to fire. 1)
   Species' post-fire responses are driven by vegetation structure, but
   vegetation - fire relationships vary spatially (the dynamic vegetation'
   hypothesis). 2) Regional variation in ecological conditions leads
   species to select different post-fire ages as habitat (the dynamic
   habitat' hypothesis). Our case study uses data on lizards at 280 sites
   in a approximate to 100 000 km(2) region of south-eastern Australia. We
   compared the predictive capacity of models based on 1) habitat
   associations, with models based on 2) fire history and vegetation type,
   and 3) fire history alone, for four species of lizards. Habitat
   association models generally out-performed fire history models in terms
   of predictive capacity. For two species, habitat association models
   provided good discrimination capacity even though the species showed
   geographically varying post-fire responses. Our results support the
   dynamic vegetation hypothesis, that spatial variation in relationships
   between fire and vegetation structure results in regional variation in
   fauna-fire relationships. These observations explain how the widely
   recognised habitat accommodation' model of animal succession can be
   conceptually accurate yet predictively weak.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire landscapes are often blanketed with a layer of ash that is
   capable of altering post-fire infiltration response. Documentation of
   ash layer characteristics, specifically ash sorptivity and hydraulic
   conductivity, is instrumental to understanding and modeling post-fire
   environments and infiltration response. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate laboratory methodologies for determining ash hydraulic
   conductivity and sorptivity based on established methodologies from soil
   measurements. A series of field and laboratory tests were conducted on
   ash from 13 high severity wildfires within western North America to
   evaluate; i) a non-destructive method for the rapid assessment of
   saturated hydraulic conductivity in the laboratory, ii) a method for
   directly measuring ash sorptivity in the laboratory and compare these
   laboratory methods, conducted on disturbed samples, to field
   measurements taken in-situ.
   The air permeametry method and the use of a sorptivity probe are viable
   methodologies for obtaining ash saturated hydraulic conductivity and
   sorptivity values respectively in the laboratory. Air permeametry was
   non-destructive, allowing ash samples to be further processed, while the
   sorptivity probe provided a direct measurement of sorptivity as values
   were collected with no gravitational component. Results were consistent
   between laboratory- and field-based methodologies, indicating that
   disturbed laboratory readings are a viable substitute for in-situ field
   measurements when pertaining to ash sorptivity and hydraulic
   conductivity. Both methodologies provide fundamental information
   regarding ash characteristics, which can be incorporated into modeling
   systems to aid in predicting post-fire infiltration response. (C) 2014

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{451}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Saprotrophic macrofungi are key decomposers of plant biomass in forests.
   These fungi form ecologically diverse group where different species
   specialize in specific substrates. Wildfires produce massive amounts of
   heterogeneous dead substrates. The postfire succession of saprotrophic
   fungi on these substrates may have major consequences on how carbon and
   nutrients are released back to forest ecosystems after a fire.
   We studied the effects of a wildfire (covering 143 ha) on saptroptrophic
   macrofungi (Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) in a Scots pine (Pines
   sylvestris) dominated forest in eastern Finland during 12 years after
   the wildfire. In particular, we focused on the consequences that
   within-fire variation in fire severity had on fungal assemblages.
   Twenty-two permanent sample plots (10 x 10 m(2) each) were monitored
   annually. Plots were located on sites with four different fire severity
   classes and on two unburned control sites. A total of 43 102 sporocarps
   of macrofungi were collected. Based on fungal life histories, we
   separated four different groups in the analyses: (1) wood-associated
   fungi on decayed wood, (2) decomposers of organic matter in soil or that
   live on bare mineral soil in forest floor, (3) biotrophic macrofungi
   that are associations between algae and fungi and that may also be
   symbiotic with mycorrhizae fungi, and (4) parasites on a living host
   plant or other fungi.
   In total, 219 species were observed. Fire severity affected species
   richness and composition, and fire always increased fungal diversity in
   comparison with unburned control sites. On the burned sites, species
   richness was highest on sites of medium burn severity (114 species in
   total, vs. 88-106 spp. on other burned sites). Substrate association of
   species was closely connected to assemblage dynamics: on soil and humus
   substrates, the succession of fire-associated pyrophilous species was
   rapid when compared to the succession of aphyllophoroid wood-associated
   macrofungi (AWAM). Pyrophilous and AWAM assemblages comprised many
   indicator species that occurred only ephemerally during the few years
   after the fire.
   In previous studies, AWAM assemblages often respond negatively to forest
   fires in short-term. Our results, however, show that if also other than
   AWAM macrofungi are included, there are several species typical for
   immediate post-fire habitats. The role that these species have on forest
   ecosystem and for example on carbon dynamics after a wildfire remains an
   important topic for future studies. From the conservation viewpoint, the
   finding emphasizes that post-fire young successional forests are
   important habitats for specialized and rare fungi.}},

Title = {{Spatial and temporal dynamics of 20th century carbon storage and
   emissions after wildfire in an old-growth forest landscape}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{449}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Both fire exclusion and subsequent wildfires have strongly affected
   carbon storage in fire-prone dry forests, with implications for how
   carbon storage will change in the future. Using a reconstruction of
   forest structure in 1899 and pre- and post-fire field data, we
   quantified changes in carbon stocks in a 2125-ha old-growth mixed
   conifer forest landscape over a century of fire exclusion and emissions
   due to a 2013 wildfire. From 1899 to 2002 aboveground carbon storage in
   live trees increased 2.5-fold from 97 Mg/ha to 263 Mg/ha. Despite
   burning in an uncharacteristically severe wildfire, the forest still
   contained 169 Mg/ha of live aboveground tree carbon in 2014. Direct fire
   emissions were 72 Mg/ha and did not vary with canopy cover loss because
   emissions were largely driven by consumption of accumulated surface
   fuels. Areas that burned at low, moderate and high severity in the
   wildfire contained similar amounts of carbon in 1899, when the forest
   was still experiencing frequent low severity fire. By 2002 the low
   severity areas contained 80 and 86 Mg/ha more aboveground live tree
   carbon than moderate and high severity areas respectively. The wildfire
   reinforced and amplified these differences in carbon storage that arose
   during fire exclusion, such that carbon storage following the wildfire
   was more variable across the landscape. Additionally, the proportion of
   carbon stored in shade-intolerant, more fire-sensitive species
   increased. These changes in where and in what tree species carbon is
   stored, due to the combination of fire exclusion and wildfire, have
   implications for the potential future stability of these carbon stocks.}},

Abstract = {{There is a wide range of soil surfactant chemistries on the market today
   that are primarily designed for the treatment of water-repellent soils
   in cropping and turfgrass systems. These chemicals may also have
   potential in treating the deleterious effects associated with post-fire
   water-repellent soils. The objective of this study was to compare 13
   commercially available soil surfactant products with regard to their
   ability to influence water penetration and soil water-holding capacity
   in post-fire water-repellent soil. The impact of the surfactant on soil
   water penetration and water-holding capacity was determined through
   water drop penetration time tests and laboratory column infiltration
   experiments, respectively. All products evaluated in the study improved
   water penetration and generally increased soil water retention; however,
   the degree of performance varied widely among products. Irrigaid Gold,
   Advantage, Penn Wetting, Pervaide, and Tournament Ready were typically
   the most effective at treating soil water repellency. Hydro Wet, Intake,
   Attain FC, Wet-Sol Gro, and EZ Wet in general showed an intermediate
   response, while Fulmax, PenaTron, and Penex were less effective than the
   other products. We assume that the products that had the greatest
   improvements in water penetration and retention will also be the most
   effective in restoring hydrologic function of post-fire water-repellent
   soils; however, the full utility of the products was not demonstrated in
   this study, particularly with respect to plant growth. Additional
   laboratory and field studies are merited for understanding how these
   different surfactant chemistries influence revegetation success.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{Debris flows often occur in burned steeplands of southern California,
   sometimes causing property damage and loss of life. In an effort to
   better understand the hydrologic controls on post-fire debris-flow
   initiation, timing and magnitude, we measured the flow stage, rainfall,
   channel bed pore fluid pressure and hillslope soil-moisture accompanying
   24 debris flows recorded in five different watersheds burned in the 2009
   Station and Jesusita Fires (San Gabriel and Santa Ynez Mountains). The
   measurements show substantial differences in debris-flow dynamics
   between sites and between sequential events at the same site. Despite
   these differences, the timing and magnitude of all events were
   consistently associated with local peaks in short duration (< = 30 min)
   rainfall intensity. Overall, debris-flow stage was best cross-correlated
   with time series of 5-min rainfall intensity, and lagged the rainfall by
   an average of just 5 min. An index of debris-flow volume was also best
   correlated with short-duration rainfall intensity, but found to be
   poorly correlated with storm cumulative rainfall and hillslope soil
   water content. Post-event observations of erosion and slope stability
   modeling suggest that the debris flows initiated primarily by processes
   related to surface water runoff, rather than shallow landslides. By
   identifying the storm characteristics most closely associated with
   post-fire debris flows, these measurements provide valuable guidance for
   warning operations and important constraints for developing and testing
   models of post-fire debris flows.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Semi-arid woodlands, which are characterised by patchy vegetation
   interspersed with bare, open areas, are frequently exposed to wildfire.
   During summer, long dry periods are occasionally interrupted by rainfall
   events. It is well known that rewetting of dry soil induces a flush of
   respiration. However, the magnitude of the flush may differ between
   vegetation patches and open areas because of different organic matter
   content, which could be further modulated by wildfire. Soils were
   collected from under trees, under shrubs or in open areas in unburnt and
   burnt sandy mallee woodland, where part of the woodland experienced a
   wildfire which destroyed or damaged most of the aboveground plant parts
   4 months before sampling. In an incubation experiment, the soils were
   exposed to two moisture treatments: constantly moist (CM) and drying and
   rewetting (DRW). In CM, soils were incubated at 80\% of maximum water
   holding capacity (WHC) for 19 days; in DRW, soils were dried for 4 days,
   kept dry for another 5 days, then rewetted to 80\% WHC and maintained at
   this water content until day 19. Soil respiration decreased during
   drying and was very low in the dry period; rewetting induced a
   respiration flush. Compared to soil under shrubs and in open areas,
   cumulative respiration per gram of soil in CM and DRW was greater under
   trees, but lower when expressed per gram of total organic carbon (TOC).
   Organic matter content, available P, and microbial biomass C, but not
   available N, were greater under trees than in open areas. Wild fire
   decreased the flush of respiration per gram of TOC in the open areas and
   under shrubs, and reduced TOC and microbial biomass C (MBC)
   concentrations only under trees, but had little effect on available N
   and P concentrations. We conclude that the impact of wildfire and DRW
   events on nutrient cycling differs among vegetation patches of a native
   semi-arid woodland which is related to organic matter amount and
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of field landscape research results, the spatial features
   of the anthropogenic impact of Pechenganikel mining and metallurgical
   plant located in the northwest of the Kola Peninsula have been analysed.
   The landscape mapping of the Plant's vicinity (scale 1 : 50 000) has
   been done, the typology of natural complexes representing the features
   of their structure and anthropogenic transformation has been developed.
   The tunturi type (upland massifs with altitudinal belts) and varaka type
   (rocky ridges) of landscapes are dominated in landscape structure. The
   main type of vegetation is mixed pine and birch subshrub forests on
   podzols. Higher than 220 m they turn into birch crooked subshrub wood on
   podzols and podzolized brown soils. On the tops higher than 320 m tundra
   subshrub and lichen communities on moderately developed soils prevail.
   However, vegetation vertical zonality has been blurred due to the
   anthropogenic influence. More than a half (58 \%) of plant and
   vegetation cover should be declared damaged: forests have been replaced
   by woodland, a significant amount of natural woodland have turned into
   hessians, burnt and barren lands on anthropogenically transformed soils
   (the result of Podzols degradation) are dominated in the area.
   Anthropogenic landscape types (pits, refuse piles, mining sites) occupy
   a relatively insignificant part (5 \%) of the area in the Plant's
   vicinity. All in all, anthropogenic impact (Plant's emissions, pits'
   dust distribution) leads to vegetation and soil cover modification and
   formation of anthropogenic landscape types.}},

Abstract = {{A tool was developed to allow managers and foresters to quickly assess
   reforestation needs following forest fire and salvage logging at the
   stand level in both pure and mixed black spruce and jack pine stands.
   This on-site operational assessment tool was created using a forest
   regeneration model that simulates the natural regeneration densities of
   black spruce and jack pine following fire and salvage. Tree species
   basal areas used for simulations represent the natural range expected in
   the field. Additional parameters include the abscission schedule of the
   species, the percentage of optimal (exposed mineral soil or humus)
   post-fire seedbeds, and the timing of the salvage operation. The tool
   also allows for rapid planning of both salvage operations and planting.
   It has important advantages over conventional seedling surveys in that
   it can be employed immediately following fire, can guide management
   decisions about the planning of road construction and the harvest
   sequence, and takes into account the entire establishment phase. Using
   the tool to adjust the harvesting schedule to minimize replanting, the
   likely final cost of reforestation can be estimated for an entire burn.
   The tool shows that a higher percentage of optimal seedbeds are
   necessary following salvage: (1) for black spruce to regenerate
   adequately compared to jack pine (i.e., planting of black spruce will
   almost always be necessary); (2) as basal area of the species of
   interest decreases; and, (3) to adequately regenerate burned intact and
   salvaged stands in late-season fires compared with those from
   early-season fires.}},

Abstract = {{A southern ridge sandhill site in central Florida, USA, was burned in
   1989, 1991, and 1995 after 63 years of fire-suppression to simulate a
   pre-settlement fire regime. Fire changed species abundance and
   vegetation structure but caused only minimal changes in species turnover
   and diversity. There was a general trend for an increase in the cover of
   herbs following fire but this was a statistically significant effect for
   only one species, Liatris tenuifolia var. tenuifolia. Aristida
   beyrichiana increased, litter cover and litter depth were significantly
   reduced, and ground lichens were eliminated in response to burning.
   Scrub oaks and palmettos in the ground cover and small shrub layers
   (height less than or equal to 1 m) either increased or did not respond
   to burning, reflecting strong post-fire resprouting. Diversity in the
   ground cover and small shrub layers were not affected by fire. Scrub
   oaks and palmettos in the large shrub and overstorey layers (height > 1
   in) were reduced in density, basal area, and longest canopy measurements
   in response to fire. Species diversity also decreased within these
   layers following fire. Some Pinus elliottii var. densa survived fire,

Abstract = {{This paper is the first global study of the extent to which fire
   determines global vegetation patterns by preventing ecosystems from
   achieving the potential height, biomass and dominant functional types
   expected under the ambient climate (climate potential).
   To determine climate potential, we simulated vegetation without fire
   using a dynamic global-vegetation model. Model results were tested
   against fire exclusion studies from different parts of the world.
   Simulated dominant growth forms and tree cover were compared with
   satellite-derived land- and tree-cover maps.
   Simulations were generally consistent with results of fire exclusion
   studies in southern Africa and elsewhere. Comparison of global `fire
   off' simulations with landcover and treecover maps show that vast areas
   of humid C-4 grasslands and savannas, especially in South America and
   Africa, have the climate potential to form forests. These are the most
   frequently burnt ecosystems in the world. Without fire, closed forests
   would double from 27\% to 56\% of vegetated grid cells, mostly at the
   expense of C-4 plants but also of C-3 shrubs and grasses in cooler
   climates.
   C-4 grasses began spreading 6-8 Ma, long before human influence on fire
   regimes. Our results suggest that fire was a major factor in their
   spread into forested regions, splitting biotas into fire tolerant and

Title = {{Post-Fire Resprouting in New Zealand Woody Vegetation: Implications for
   Restoration}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Resprouting is an important trait that allows plants to persist after
   fire and is considered a key functional trait in woody plants. While
   resprouting is well documented in fire-prone biomes, information is
   scarce in non-fire-prone ecosystems, such as New Zealand (NZ) forests.
   Our objective was to investigate patterns of post-fire resprouting in NZ
   by identifying the ability of species to resprout and quantifying the
   resprouting rates within the local plant community. Fire occurrence is
   likely to increase in NZ as a consequence of climate change, and this
   investigation addresses an important knowledge gap needed for planning
   restoration actions in fire-susceptible regions. The study was conducted
   in two phases: (1) A detailed review of the resprouting ability of the
   NZ woody flora, and (2) a field study where the post-fire responses of
   plants were quantified. The field study was undertaken in the eastern
   South Island, where woody plants (>5 cm diameter at 30 cm height) were
   sampled in 10 plots (10x10 m), five- and 10-months post-fire. The
   research synthesized the resprouting ability of 73 woody species and is
   the first to provide extensive quantitative data on resprouting in NZ.
   Most of the canopy dominant species were non-resprouters, but many
   smaller trees and shrubs were capable of resprouting, despite their
   evolution in an environment with low fire frequency. Species composition
   and abundance were important predictors of resprouting patterns among
   plots, with similar communities resulting in similar resprouting
   responses. Resprouting capacity provides species with a competitive
   advantage in the post-fire recovery. We suggest that it is possible to
   engineer more fire resilient restoration plantings by planting higher
   proportions of the resprouters identified in this study. The
   incorporation of resprouting as a trait in restoration plans is likely
   to be relevant not just in NZ, but also in other non-fire-prone regions
   facing increases in fire frequency.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In ecosystems subject to regular canopy fires, woody species have
   evolved two general strategies of post-fire regeneration. Seeder species
   are killed by fire and populations regenerate solely by post-fire
   recruitment from a seed bank. Resprouter species survive fire and
   regenerate by vegetative regrowth from protected organs. Interestingly,
   the abundance of these strategies varies along environmental gradients
   and across regions. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain
   this spatial variation: the gap dependence and the
   environmental-variability hypotheses. The gap-dependence model predicts
   that seeders are favoured in sparse vegetation (vegetation gaps allowing
   effective post-fire recruitment of seedlings), while resprouters are
   favoured in densely vegetated sites (seedlings being outcompeted by the
   rapid crown regrowth of resprouters). The environmental-variability
   model predicts that seeders would prevail in reliable rainfall areas,
   whereas resprouters would be favoured in areas under highly variable
   rainfall that are prone to severe dry events (leading to high post-fire
   seedling mortality). We tested these two models using distribution data,
   captured at the scale of quarter-degree cells, for seeder and resprouter
   species of two speciose shrub genera (Aspalathus and Erica) common in
   fire-prone fynbos ecosystems of the mediterranean-climate part of the
   Cape Floristic Region. Contrary to the predictions of the gap-dependence
   model, species number of both resprouters and seeders increased with
   values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (a widely used
   surrogate for vegetation density), with a more marked increase for
   seeders. The predictions of the environmental-variability hypothesis, by
   contrast, were not refuted by this study. Seeder and resprouter species
   of both genera showed highest richness in environments with high
   rainfall reliability. However, with decreasing reliability, seeder
   numbers dropped more quickly than those of resprouters. We conclude that
   the environmental-variability model is better able to explain the
   abundance of woody seeder and resprouter species in Southern Hemisphere
   fire-prone shrublands (fynbos and kwongan) than the gap-dependence
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide essential ecosystem services, and declines in some
   pollinator communities around the world have been reported.
   Understanding the fundamental components defining these communities is
   essential if conservation and restoration are to be successful. We
   examined the structure of plant-pollinator communities in a dynamic
   Mediterranean landscape, comprising a mosaic of post-fire regenerating
   habitats, and which is a recognized global hotspot for bee diversity.
   Each community was characterized by a highly skewed species abundance
   distribution, with a few dominant and many rare bee species, and was
   consistent with a log series model indicating that a few environmental
   factors govern the community.
   Floral community composition, the quantity and quality of forage
   resources present, and the geographic locality organized bee communities
   at various levels: (1) The overall structure of the bee community (116
   species), as revealed through ordination, was dependent upon nectar
   resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar
   volume-concentration combinations available), the ratio of pollen to
   nectar energy, floral diversity, floral abundance, and post-fire age.
   (2) Bee diversity, measured as species richness, was closely linked to
   floral diversity (especially of annuals), nectar resource diversity, and
   post-fire age of the habitat. (3) The abundance of the most common
   species was primarily related to post-fire age, grazing intensity, and
   nesting substrate availability. Ordination models based on
   age-characteristic post-fire floral community structure explained
   39-50\% of overall variation observed in bee community structure.
   Cluster analysis showed that all the communities shared a high degree of
   similarity in their species composition (27-59\%); however, the
   geographical location of sites also contributed a smaller but
   significant component to bee community structure.
   We conclude that floral resources act in specific and previously
   unexplored ways to modulate the diversity of the local geographic
   species pool, with specific disturbance factors, superimposed upon these
   patterns, mainly affecting the dominant species.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive wildfires have affected the Valencia region in the last two
   decades. A large portion of the burnt areas has been localised in old
   fields. Although Mediterranean communities are usually resilient to fire
   and recover very quickly to the pre-fire state, burnt old fields with a
   low number of species could show poor recovery capacity. The response
   capacity of these systems to fire, and, especially, the role of the
   native herbaceous Brachypodium retusum were studied. Two years after
   fire, plant cover reached a value of 56 \%. Resprouter species were more
   important in number and in specific cover. B. retusum represented the
   species with the highest contribution to total plant cover for all the
   study period. Total biomass in burnt plots was always lower than in
   unburnt plots. However, B. retusum green biomass showed a quick recovery
   to pre-disturbance levels, and below-ground biomass was similar in burnt
   and unburnt plots. Reproductive biomass greatly increased in burnt with
   respect to unburnt plots during the first post-fire year, with no stalk
   production in unburnt plots. B. retusum may be considered a promising
   species for the restoration of extremely degraded lands because of its
   high resilience to fire. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales

Abstract = {{The lowland forests of coastal Tanzania comprise small and
   geographically isolated remnants of evergreen or semi-evergreen forest
   vegetation of the Zanzibar-Inhambane regional mosaic-undifferentiated
   forest type. Most of these `coastal forests' are located at less than
   600 m attitude and within 50 km of the coast. They have been isolated
   from other forest-blocks in Africa for perhaps the past 30 million years
   and have considerable biological importance, with high levels of
   endemism.
   This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the distribution, status
   and biological importance of those Tanzanian coastal forests over 2 km2
   in extent. Twenty-four definite and 17 probable forests are identified.
   The largest are located on the Matumbi Massif to the southeast of Utete
   (c. 25 km2), Zaraninge Plateau to the east of Sadaani (c. 20 km2),
   Gendagenda to the west of Pangani (c. 26 kM2), Pugu Kazimzumbwi (c. 30
   km2) and inland from Kilwa (up to 100 km2). However, individual forests
   generally occupy less than 20 km2, and the total area of forest
   remaining may be under 400 kM2.
   Collectively these forests support many rare and poorly known plant
   species, including around 50 believed to be endemic to a single forest,
   seven bird species and subspecies of global conservation significance,
   several rare mammals, reptiles and amphibians, and an invertebrate fauna
   with many rare and undescribed species.
   All Tanzanian coastal forests are being destroyed by unsustainable human
   actions generally following the sequence (a) logging for timber and
   fuel; (b) pole-cutting to build houses; (c) wholesale burning for
   charcoal; (d) wholesale conversion to agriculture. At the present rate
   of destruction the Tanzanian coastal forests and their globally
   important flora and fauna may be completely removed.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{368}},
Pages = {{17-27}},

Abstract = {{In managed boreal forests, variable retention harvest is considered by
   forest managers as a means of mitigating harvest impacts on
   biodiversity. Variable retention harvest consists of maintaining within
   a cut block structural attributes of the original forest stand in intact
   forest patches that could provide quality habitat (i.e., with large
   trees and deadwood) for many forest species during forest regeneration.
   However, retention patch modalities (size, shape, age of the forest)
   allowing both persistence and sustainable recruitment of deadwood over
   time remains unknown. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
   abundance of recent deadwood in post-harvest and post-fire residual
   patches and to compare their temporal dynamics in black spruce dominated
   stands located in northwestern Quebec. Abundance of the recent deadwood,
   estimated as the sum of recent standing deadwood volume and recently
   fallen deadwood volume was analyzed in 41 post-fire residual patches,
   and in 45 post-harvest retention patches of varying ages (i.e. exposure
   time to the disturbed matrix) and in 37 continuous black spruce forest
   stands (controls). This study shows that post-fire residual patches
   appear in general more durable than post-harvest retention patches after
   disturbance. In a management context, our results indicate that: (1)
   large island patches and large linear separators oriented to escape
   windthrow usually have deadwood recruitment dynamics similar to that of
   post-fire patches; (2) retention patches with an initial stand volume
   greater than 60 m(3)/ha will generate more deadwood volume over time.
   This suggests that the selection of large retention patches in the shape
   of an island or a separator, with high volume (between 60 and 300 m3/ha)
   should help increase the persistence of post-harvest retention patches
   in black spruce forest, and simultaneously ensure quality habitat for
   several forest species while the adjacent managed forest regenerates.

Abstract = {{The concept that vegetation structure (and faunal habitat) develops
   predictably with time since fire has been central to understanding the
   relationship between fire and fauna. However, because plants regenerate
   after fire in different ways (e.g. resprouting from above-ground stems
   vs. underground lignotubers), use of simple categories based on time
   since fire might not adequately represent post-fire habitat development
   in all ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that the post-fire
   development of faunal habitat structure differs between ecosystems,
   depending on fire regeneration traits of the dominant canopy trees. We
   measured 12 habitat components at sites in foothill forests (n = 38),
   heathy woodlands (n = 38) and mallee woodlands (n = 98) in Victoria,
   Australia, and used generalised additive models to predict changes in
   each variable with time since fire. A greater percentage of faunal
   habitat variables responded significantly to time since fire in mallee
   woodlands, where fires typically are stand-replacing, than in foothill
   forests and heathy woodlands, where canopy tree stems generally persist
   through fire. In the ecosystem with the highest proportion of epicormic
   resprouters (foothill forests), only ground cover and understorey
   vegetation responded significantly to time since fire, compared with all
   but one variable in the ecosystem dominated by basal resprouters (mallee
   woodlands). These differences between ecosystems in the post-fire
   development of key habitat components suggest there may also be
   fundamental differences in the role of fire in shaping the distribution
   of fauna. If so, this challenges the way in which many fire-prone
   ecosystems currently are categorised and managed, especially the level
   of dependence on time since fire and other temporal surrogates such as
   age-classes and successional states. Where time since fire is a poor
   surrogate for habitat structural development, additional complexity
   (e.g. fire severity, topography and prior land-use history) could better
   capture processes that determine faunal occurrence in fire-prone
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{FIRE EFFECTS ON WILDLIFE IN THE CENTRAL HARDWOODS AND APPALACHIAN
   REGIONS, USA}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{127-159}},
Abstract = {{Fire is being prescribed and used increasingly to promote ecosystem
   restoration (e.g., oak woodlands and savannas) and to manage wildlife
   habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachian regions, USA. However,
   questions persist as to how fire affects hardwood forest communities and
   associated wildlife, and how fire should be used to achieve management
   goals. We provide an up-to-date review of fire effects on various
   wildlife species and their habitat in the Central Hardwoods and
   Appalachians. Documented direct effects (i.e., mortality) on wildlife
   are rare. Indirect effects (i.e., changes in habitat quality) are
   influenced greatly by light availability, fire frequency, and fire
   intensity. Unless fire intensity is great enough to kill a portion of
   the overstory, burning in closed-canopy forests has provided little
   benefit for most wildlife species in the region because it doesn't
   result in enough sunlight penetration to elicit understory response.
   Canopy reduction through silvicultural treatment has enabled managers to
   use fire more effectively. Fire intensity must be kept low in hardwoods
   to limit damage to many species of overstory trees. However, wounding or
   killing trees with fire benefits many wildlife species by allowing
   increased sunlight to stimulate understory response, snag and subsequent
   cavity creation, and additions of large coarse woody debris. In general,
   a fire-return interval of 2 yr to 7 yr benefits a wide variety of
   wildlife species by providing a diverse structure in the understory;
   increasing browse, forage, and soft mast; and creating snags and
   cavities. Historically, dormant- season fire was most prevalent in these
   regions, and it still is when most prescribed fire is implemented in
   hardwood systems as burn-days are relatively few in the growing season
   of May through August because of shading from leaf cover and high fuel
   moisture. Late growing- season burning increases the window for burning,
   and better control on woody composition is possible. Early
   growing-season fire may pose increased risk for some species, especially
   herpetofauna recently emerged from winter hibernacula (April) or forest
   songbirds that nest in the understory (May to June). However, negative
   population-level effects are unlikely unless the burned area is
   relatively large and early growing-season fire is used continually. We
   did not find evidence that fire is leading to population declines for
   any species, including Endangered Species Act (ESA)- listed species
   (e.g., Indiana bat {[}Myotissodalis Mill. Allen] or northern long-eared
   bat {[}M. septentrionalis Trouess.]). Instead, data indicate that fire
   can enhance habitat for bats by increasing suitability of foraging and
   day-roost sites. Similarly, concern over burning and displacement of
   woodland salamanders (Plethodontidae), another taxa of heightened
   conservation concern, is alleviated when fire is prescribed along
   ecologically appropriate aspect and slope gradients and not forced into
   mesic, high site index environments where salamanders are most common.
   Because topography across the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians is
   diverse, we contend that applying fire on positions best suited for
   burning is an effective approach to increase regional landscape
   heterogeneity and biological diversity. Herein, we offer prescriptive
   concepts for burning for various wildlife species and guilds in the
   Central Hardwoods and Appalachians.}},

Abstract = {{Fire frequencies are changing in Neotropical savannas and forests as a
   result of forest fragmentation and increasing drought. Such changes in
   fire regime and climate are hypothesized to destabilize tropical carbon
   storage, but there has been little consideration of the widespread
   variability in tree fire tolerance strategies. To test how aboveground
   carbon stocks change with fire frequency and composition of plants with
   different fire tolerance strategies, we update the Ecosystem Demography
   model 2 (ED2) with (i) a fire survivorship module based on tree bark
   thickness (a key fire-tolerance trait across woody plants in savannas
   and forests), and (ii) plant functional types representative of trees in
   the region. With these updates, the model is better able to predict how
   fire frequency affects population demography and aboveground woody
   carbon. Simulations illustrate that the high survival rate of
   thick-barked, large trees reduces carbon losses with increasing fire
   frequency, with high investment in bark being particularly important in
   reducing losses in the wettest sites. Additionally, in landscapes that
   frequently burn, bark investment can broaden the range of climate and
   fire conditions under which savannas occur by reducing the range of
   conditions leading to either complete tree loss or complete grass loss.
   These results highlight that tropical vegetation dynamics depend not
   only on rainfall and changing fire frequencies but also on tree fire
   survival strategy. Further, our results indicate that fire survival
   strategy is fundamentally important in regulating tree size demography
   in ecosystems exposed to fire, which increases the preservation of
   aboveground carbon stocks and the coexistence of different plant
   functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{The 1351 ha Walker Fire burned in late August 2015 on the eastern Sierra
   Nevada, California escarpment from sagebrush steppe and pinyon pine
   woodlands (2150 m) through mid-elevation forests into subalpine
   whitebark pine (WBP; 3310 m). Fuels were particularly dry due not only
   to the season but as a result of a record multi-year drought
   (2012-2015). The fire burned into stands heavily impacted by a mountain
   pine beetle outbreak (MPB) during a prior drought (2007-2010). Using
   plot data, we report 100\% mortality due to fire of understory
   vegetation and trees in pinyon pine, aspen, white fir, and lodgepole
   pine forest types. Fire-caused tree mortality was lower in Jeffrey pine
   forests (80\%), although 100\% of the understory was killed by the fire.
   For WBP plots in areas that had not been affected by MPB, 100\% of
   understory and tree layers also burned. Where the fire burned through
   plots within the former MPB-outbreak area, 2 of 15 plots had 100\%
   understory vegetation and trees burned by the fire, while the remaining
   13 had varying levels of survivorship. In those plots, pines dead from
   prior beetle-kill as well as live trees remained unburned, as did
   understory vegetation. Whereas such ``gray-stage{''} stands have been
   found to reduce fire severity in other regions and forest types, the
   observed reduction of surface fire was unexpected. In that fires in the
   subalpine WBP zone and bark beetle-fire interactions have not been
   studied in California, these preliminary observations suggest that
   subalpine forests are vulnerable to fire where continuous fuels exist
   below them. However, in xeric, Mediterranean landscapes, MPB outbreaks
   in WBP may reduce subsequent burn severity in unexpected ways. These
   findings may be important given current concerns for WBP's rangewide
   vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a model of heath vegetation, in which species were
   classified into five functional groups based on characteristics of their
   propagule pools, post-fire growth, timing and mode of reproduction and
   competitive status. The model assumes no recruitment without fire and a
   simple competitive hierarchy based on vertical stature. A critical
   feature of the model is an initial post-fire window of 5-6 yr in which
   competition from overstorey species on understorey species is reduced.
   Understorey functional groups differ in their ability to exploit this
   window.
   In the field, we tested five predictions derived from the model: (a)
   overall species richness of understorey varies inversely with overstorey
   density as a result of a trend in richness of woody species, but not in
   herbaceous species; (b) where an overstorey was present in the previous
   fire interval, post-fire population density is reduced in a functional
   group of understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, but not in a group
   of understorey obligate-seeding shrubs with soil seed banks; (c) in
   understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, post-fire regrowth in
   resprouting individuals is adversely affected by the presence of an
   overstorey in the preceding fire interval; (d) in understorey serotinous
   resprouting shrubs, levels of pre-fire propagules are lower in the
   presence of an overstorey, reducing the density of post-fire recruits;
   and (e) in understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, recruitment
   relative to the pre-fire population is unaffected by overstorey species
   within the window of reduced competition. Of these, three tests (a,b,d)
   supported the model, one (e) may support the model, but the results were
   inconclusive and one (c) did not support the model.
   Limitations and further applications of the model are discussed. Our
   results suggest that maintenance of high densities of overstorey
   populations is in conflict with conservation of some understorey
   species. Models of the type we propose will help identify and resolve
   such conflicts and promote the judicious use of fire to maintain full
   species diversity of plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Species can persist in a landscape with recurrent disturbances either
   through local survival or by dispersing to sites of a preferred
   successional stage. This study investigated in what extent forest floor
   dwelling land snails survived forest fires and clear-cutting. Snail
   fauna in LFH (litter, fermenting litter and humus) samples below
   retained aspen trees in disturbed areas were compared with samples under
   scattered aspens in adjacent forests by extracting snails from LFH
   samples below five aspens in several stands of each type (five forest
   fires, six clear-cuts, and seven undisturbed forests). LFH samples from
   burnt sites had a higher pH than from forests, but on average a lower
   abundance of individual snails (11 vs. 30 in 0.5 I LFH) and 50\% lower
   species density (3 vs. 6 species). The abundances and species densities
   in the clear-cuts were less affected. There was generally a positive
   relationship between pH and both species density and abundance in all
   the stand types. Burning apparently depleted the snail fauna
   considerably and some species may be dependent on dispersal if they are
   to recover within the burnt area, while the snail assemblages at
   clear-cuts did not differ significantly in species composition from
   adjacent forests. The positive relationship between pH and snail
   prevalence on the burnt sites raises questions regarding the pre- and
   post-fire spatial variation in pH (and available minerals) within and
   among stands and how it relates to snail survival rates and their
   capacity to track suitable places after the disturbance. Retained aspens
   at clear-cuts seem to harbour a forest like land snail fauna. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Although fire exclusion is thought to be liked with declining plant
   diversity in oak forests, few studies have examined long-term changes in
   their shrub and ground layers resulting from repeated burning. In this
   study, we compare the composition and structure of woody understory and
   ground layer vegetation in burned and unburned oak forest after 17 years
   of annual dormant season low-intensity burns. Over time, burned forest
   had 97\% reduction of shrubs and small saplings, but only 38\% loss of
   stems in the > 5-10 cm size class. Canopy openness was similar in burned
   and unburned forest plots prior to the onset of burning, but it was
   significantly greater in burned forest after 17 years of fire. Ground
   layer vegetation structure also changed significantly, with responses
   differing by guilds. Spring herbs were the dominant guild before burning
   and did not change over time. However, cover and abundance of summer
   herbs increased over time in burned forest, probably in response to
   greater light assimilation under the more open canopy. This resulted in
   greater overall species richness in burned plots without loss of the
   spring herbs. Burning eliminated most alien shrubs, although common
   buckthorn persisted in small numbers. The alien herb garlic mustard also
   persisted and had greater abundance in burned plots, apparently by
   re-colonizing from unburned micro-habitats and adjacent forest. These
   results indicate that long-term burning can eliminate shrub and small
   sapling canopy cover, thereby increasing canopy openness and promoting
   greater richness and cover of summer forbs. Fire also probably had a
   positive effect on seedling establishment through removal of litter.
   Resulting tradeoffs to this gain in diversity include loss of native
   vines, shrubs, understory trees and forest interior bird habitat, as
   well as persistence of alien plants.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of long-term fire exclusion on the structure and
   mortality of a calden (Prosopis caldenia Burkart) woodland, a rare
   vegetation type remaining only in fragments in semi-arid Central
   Argentina. We tested the hypothesis that differences in calden stand
   structure are consequence of differences in fire history by quantifying
   DBH and tree height in 30 plots set in calden woodlands with fire
   occurring at least every 10 y, with fire excluded for 20-30 y and
   without fire for at least 60 y. Stem height, density and basal area
   increased after 20-30 years of fire exclusion. The frequently burned
   woodland had high mortality in all but the largest (>60 cm in DBH and >8
   m in height) size class, whereas the fire-excluded plots exhibited high
   mortality only in the smallest stems (<15 cm in DBH and <3 m in height).
   Our results showed that the fire exclusion increased stem basal area and
   density while decreasing mortality of larger size classes and reducing
   resprouting of stems of any size; the probable explanation for these
   changes is a shift in the prevalent thinning mechanisms from
   fire-induced to competition-induced mortality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Question Recent studies revealed by indirect evidence that lichen-spruce
   woodlands in the closed-crown boreal forest are an alternative stable
   state of black spruce-feathermoss stands. This paper aims to demonstrate
   and quantify black spruce forest cover regression following successive
   wildfire events in the closed-crown forest zone during the 20th century.
   A case study in north-eastern North American closed-crown forest zone is
   presented. Location The study area is at the centre of the closed-crown
   boreal forest zone of eastern Canada (49 degrees 59N, 71 degrees 59W).
   Methods A burned area of 25ha was selected in which three tree cohorts
   were visible. The first cohort contains partly buried trunks and stumps
   of a stand destroyed by a forest fire in 1920, the second contains
   standing dead trees from a 1995 forest fire and the third contains
   seedlings established after the 1995 fire. Fires were dated by scar
   analyses of living trees at the edge of the site. An array of sample
   plots was established in autumn 1997 to evaluate each cohort in terms of
   stocking and tree density. Results Black spruce stocking decreased
   significantly between cohorts, from 43.5\% in Cohort 1 (all coniferous
   trees) to 25.6\% in Cohort 2 and 11.5\% in Cohort 3 (2011). Jack pine
   showed an inverse tendency, from 0\% in Cohort 1 (not determined) to 0\%
   in Cohort 2 and 3.8\% in Cohort 3. Black spruce stems per hectare also
   dropped significantly from a minimum of 1322 in Cohort 1 to 1088 in
   Cohort 2 and 976 in Cohort 3. Conclusions This study is the first
   quantitative demonstration that lichen-spruce woodlands in the
   closed-crown boreal forest zone are an alternative stable state of black
   spruce-feathermoss stands. Stocking levels and densities markedly
   declined after each of the two fires (1920 and 1995) that both occurred
   after spruce budworm outbreaks (1910 and 1980) and are most likely
   responsible for the shift from a closed-crown to an open woodland.}},

Abstract = {{Alcoa of Australia Limited has been rehabilitating bauxite mines in the
   jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of Western Australia for more than
   30 years. Mines rehabilitated in the early 1980s using out-dated methods
   have built up substantial fuel loads that may be reduced through
   prescribed burning. The vegetation response of 11-13 year-old
   rehabilitated bauxite mines to fire regimes differing in intensity and
   season over the first two years of post-burn succession is compared to
   the native jarrah forest. A total of 243 species from 137 genera and 56
   families were identified in the native forest reference sites and in the
   11-13 year-old rehabilitated areas before and after burning. The
   vegetation of the pre-burn rehabilitated areas was very different to
   that of the native jarrah forest. While total live plant cover, Acacia
   density, non-native eucalypt seedling density, weed density and the
   evenness index were similar between the two areas, total plant density,
   live Acacia cover, the proportion of weeds, native species numbers and
   diversity were significantly different. However, the greatest difference
   between the vegetation of the pre-burn rehabilitated sites and the
   native jarrah forest was the higher dominance of seeding species (plants
   killed by fire) in rehabilitated areas. In contrast, native jarrah
   forest was dominated by resprouting species (plants that survive fire).
   Burning the rehabilitated sites was successful in making the areas more
   similar to the forest in terms of total plant density, live Acacia cover
   and native species numbers but decreased their similarity in terms of
   live plant cover, Acacia density, non-native eucalypt seedling density,
   weed density and evenness. The vegetation response of the rehabilitated
   areas to different seasons of burning showed that autumn burning led to
   a greater increase in plant establishment than spring burning. Autumn
   burning also resulted in an undesirable increase in the density of
   non-native eucalypt seedlings that was not observed following spring
   burning. Although burning these 11-13 year-old rehabilitated sites will
   increase similarity to the native forest, it is unlikely that they will
   resemble the native jarrah forest without further management
   intervention.}},

Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Despite decades of research, the primary factors determining savanna
   structure remain elusive - a conundrum termed `the savanna problem'.
   After 47 years of annual burning in Terminalia woodland and
   Acacia/Combretum savanna on sandy, granite-derived soils in the southern
   Kruger National Park, South Africa, a dense cover of trees and shrubs
   persists on some burnt plots and is largely absent from others. We
   postulated that intense browsing pressure by antelope and other
   herbivores prevents recruitment of trees in burnt plots and that
   herbivores concentrate on plots that are richest in nutrients. Herbivore
   abundance did not show a relationship with soil macronutrients and we
   consequently investigated micronutrient status. The reduction in tree
   cover as a result of annual burning was positively correlated with mass
   of herbivores (15-1500 kg) (r (2) = 0.61, n = 8). This index of
   herbivore abundance was in turn positively correlated with total Zn (r
   (2) = 0.64, n = 8). Other indices of herbivore abundance showed
   significant relationships with total clay content and total Mn. We
   suggest that herbivores concentrate on sites with greater clay content
   (possibly due to a greater availability of micronutrients), and that
   tree cover can remain relatively dense under a regime of annual burning
   if browsing pressure is not intense. The long-term burn experiments in
   the Kruger National Park savanna provide a platform for unravelling the
   savanna problem. Determining possible interactions between soil
   properties, herbivory and fire is a step in this direction.}},

Abstract = {{To describe root system topology of Pinus halepensis and Cistus
   monspeliensis saplings co-inhabiting natural post-fire sites, 55 P.
   halepensis and 26 C. monspeliensis saplings were extracted by the total
   excavation method from a burnt pine stand. Seedlings were individually
   labelled when emerging after fire and extracted three years later, at
   the sapling phase. In order to evaluate the effect of inter-specific
   competition of C. monspeliensis on P. halepensis root system, a
   stratified sampling was carried out according to density and height of
   the saplings. Topological parameters considered in the analysis were
   magnitude, total external pathlength, and altitude of the root systems.
   Weight and length of roots were also measured in order to estimate the
   specific root length, an index commonly used in morphological studies.
   Results clearly evidenced greater variability in root system topology of
   P. halepensis than C. monspeliensis saplings. Herringbone architecture
   (i.e., the most ordered pattern possible, with branching confined to the
   main axis) characterised small pine saplings, regardless of competition
   from C. monspeliensis, which changed to random branching in large
   saplings. In medium sized saplings, the root system was affected by
   inter-specific competition, which delayed changes in root branching. In
   contrast, C. monspeliensis invariably adopted randomly branched
   architecture, regardless of intra-specific competition. It is concluded
   that such different topological patterns make C. monspeliensis more
   competitive during the early stages of post-fire succession, because its
   root system is much more transport-efficient in the nutrient-rich
   environment. Those pines which finally branch roots by random pattern
   will reach higher stem height and magnitude, a factor which allows them
   to successfully compete with C. monspeliensis for soil nutrients and
   water. The morphological analysis showed a significant increase in the
   specific root length with competition, both in P. halepensis and C.
   monspeliensis saplings, which could be interpreted as a consequence of
   the reduction of root diameter in response to nutrient depletion.}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The lichen woodland (LW) is an open-crown subarctic forest distributed
   principally in North America where it extends from Newfoundland in
   Atlantic Canada to the Yukon and Alaska. It is the main tree ecosystem
   of the LW zone north of the closed-crown boreal forest zone, and south
   of the forest-tundra zone where its cover diminishes progressively
   toward the Arctic tree line. Growth and development of LWs are closely
   dependent on dry-mesic, nutrient-poor podzolic soil environments largely
   distributed on the Canadian Precambrian Shield. The sun exposed open
   structure and dominance of lichen species on the dry-mesic soils of LWs
   determine many of their functions. A diversified cryptogamic flora is
   thriving in LWs due to reduced competition from vascular plants unable
   to grow and survive on dry, nutrient-poor soils. Because of the reduced
   greenhouse effect caused by the open structure and dominance of
   pale-color lichen mats inducing a greater albedo, LWs exerts a negative
   microclimatic impact on the environment culminating in the reduction of
   the frost-free growth season and increase and intensity of frost events.
   A suite of common, often recurrent, sometime compounding, fine- and
   large-scale disturbances (including climate change) activates the
   successional dynamics of LWs and also their historical and present
   expansion and contraction across the boreal biome. Post-disturbance
   chronosequences induced by fire, wind and caribou trampling and grazing
   are producing similar seral communities converging toward the self
   maintenance of the LW ecosystem. Long-term succession in southernmost LW
   sites possibly converges toward the closing of tree canopy and recovery
   of closed-crown conifer forests (CCCF) in absence of fire. The creation
   of LW occurred repeatedly during the late Holocene, as well as its
   extirpation from the northernmost sites (forest tundra zone) with
   wildfire as the principal triggering mechanism. LWs are presently unable
   to transgress the tree line, except for minor advances in small confined
   sites. Current evidence of the dual distribution of LWs and CCCF in
   eastern Canada shows that the LW zone is expanding southward into the
   CCCF zone, where compound disturbances associated with epidemics
   followed by small to extensive fires are transforming dense forest
   stands to LWs, a process most likely independent of climate. In terms of
   ecosystem management, there are concerns about the maintenance of the
   southernmost LWs within the CCCF zone as poor carbon sinks. Projects
   involving LW plantation sites in the CCCF zone in eastern Canada are
   proposed to offset the increased emission of atmospheric gases and thus
   mitigate climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Stratigraphic and geomorphic evidence indicate floods that occur soon
   after forest fires have been intermittent but common events in many
   mountainous areas during the past several thousand years. The magnitude
   and recurrence of these post-fire flood events reflects the joint
   probability between the recurrence of fires and the recurrence of
   subsequent rainfall events of varying magnitude and intensity. Following
   the May 1996 Buffalo Creek, Colorado, forest fire, precipitation amounts
   and intensities that generated very little surface runoff outside of the
   burned area resulted in severe hillslope erosion, floods, and streambed
   sediment entrainment in the rugged, severely burned, 48 km(2) area.
   These floods added sediment to many existing alluvial fans, while
   simultaneously incising other fans and alluvial deposits. Incision of
   older fans revealed multiple sequences of fluvially transported sandy
   gravel that grade upward into charcoal-rich, loamy horizons. We
   interpret these sequences to represent periods of high sediment
   transport and aggradation during floods, followed by intervals of
   quiescence and relative stability in the watershed until a subsequent
   fire occurred.
   An alluvial sequence near the mouth of a tributary draining a 0-82 km(2)
   area indicated several previous post-fire flood cycles in the watershed.
   Dendrochronologic and radiocarbon ages of material in this deposit span
   approximately 2900 years, and define three aggradational periods. The
   three general aggradational periods are separated by intervals of
   approximately nine to ten centuries and reflect a `millennium-scale'
   geomorphic response to a closely timed sequence of events: severe and
   intense, watershed-scale, stand-replacing fires and subsequent
   rainstorms and flooding. Millennium-scale aggradational units at the
   study site may have resulted from a scenario in which the initial runoff
   from the burned watershed transported and deposited large volumes of
   sediment on downstream alluvial surfaces and tributary fans. Subsequent
   storm runoff may have produced localized incision and channelization.
   preventing additional vertical aggradation on the sampled alluvial
   deposit for several centuries. Two of the millennium-scale aggradational
   periods at the study site consist of multiple gravel and loam sequences
   with similar radiocarbon ages. These closely dated sequences may reflect
   a `multidecade-scale' geomorphic response to more frequent. but aerially
   limited and less severe fires, followed by rainstorms of relatively
   common recurrence. Published in 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed the relationship between burn severity indicators, from
   remote sensing and field observations, and soil properties after a
   wildfire in a fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystem. Our study area was a
   large wildfire in a Pinus pinaster forest. Burn severity from remote
   sensing was identified by studying immediate post-fire Land Surface
   Temperature (LST). We also evaluated burn severity in the field applying
   the Composite Burn Index (CBI) in a total of 84 plots (30 m diameter).
   In each plot we evaluated litter consumption, ash colour and char depth
   as visual indicators. We collected soil samples and pH, soil organic
   carbon, dry aggregate size distribution (MWD), aggregate stability and
   water repellency were analysed. A controlled heating of soil was also
   carried out in the laboratory, with soil from the control plots, to
   compare with the changes produced in soils affected by different
   severity levels in the field. Our results shown that changes in soil
   properties affected by wildfire were only observed in soil aggregation
   in the high severity situation. The laboratory-controlled heating showed
   that temperatures of about 300 degrees C result in a significant
   reduction in soil organic carbon and MWD. Furthermore, soil organic
   carbon showed a significant decrease when LST values increased. Char
   depth was the best visual indicator to show changes in soil properties
   (mainly physical properties) in large fires that occur in Mediterranean
   pine forests. We conclude that CBI and post-fire LST can be considered
   good indicators of soil burn severity since both indicate the impact of

Abstract = {{The impact of wildfire on (a) slope hydrological processes, (b) soil
   erodibility, and (c) post-fire hillslope sediment and phosphorus (P;
   dissolved and particulate) yields are quantified for natural forest
   areas of the burned Evrotas River basin, Peloponnese, Greece. Further,
   the geochemical partitioning of P in burned and unburned sediment is
   evaluated by sequential extraction to assess potential bioavailability
   of particulate P (PP) in downstream aquatic ecosystems.
   A series of field-based rainfall simulation and infiltration experiments
   were undertaken in burned and unburned terrain of contrasting vegetation
   and soil type, after severe wildfires in summer 2007. Resulting water
   and sediment samples were analyzed for P concentration to permit
   calculation of hillslope yields for 20, 40, and 60 mm h(-1) rainfall
   events. Samples of soil were collected from each site type for physical
   and geochemical analyses.
   Plot-scale rainfall simulation experiments and measurements demonstrate
   enhanced runoff and erosion rates in burned terrain. While dissolved P
   concentrations in runoff from burned terrain are elevated (0.21 +/- 0.09
   mg l(-1)) against background levels (0.01 +/- 0.01 mg l(-1)) and exceed
   European water quality guidelines, PP represents 99\% of the severely
   burned hillslope P yield (2.32 +/- 1.63 kg ha(-1) for a 15-min rainfall
   event). Sequential extraction data demonstrate that up to 20\% of total
   PP in burned sediment is potentially bioavailable and that bioavaliable
   PP yields are two orders of magnitude greater than dissolved P yields.
   Release of P from eroded sediment stored in downslope/downstream sink
   zones may protract the post-fire risk to downstream resources.
   Quantification of PP partitioning in eroded sediment is a key
   requirement when assessing the downstream impacts of wildfire.}},

   tundra terrain units. The variability in thermokarst development appears
   to be influenced by the interaction of tundra fire burn severity and
   near-surface, ground-ice content. Subsidence was greatest in severely
   burned, ice-rich upland terrain (yedoma), accounting for -50\% of the
   detected subsidence, despite representing only 30\% of the fire
   disturbed study area. Microtopography increased by 340\% in this terrain
   unit as a result of ice wedge degradation. Increases in the frequency,
   magnitude, and severity of tundra fires will contribute to future
   thermokarst development and associated landscape change in Arctic tundra
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp. and Corymbia spp.) dominate many communities
   across Australia, including frequently burnt tropical savannas and
   temperate forests, which receive less frequent but more intense fires.
   Understanding the demographic characteristics that allow related trees
   to persist in tropical savannas and temperate forest ecosystems can
   provide insight into how savannas and forests function, including
   grass-tree coexistence. This study reviews differences in critical
   stages in the life cycle of savanna and temperate forest eucalypts,
   especially in relation to fire. It adds to the limited data on tropical
   eucalypts, by evaluating the effect of fire regimes on the population
   biology of Corymbia clarksoniana, a tree that dominates some tropical
   savannas of north-eastern Australia. Corymbia clarksoniana displays
   similar demographic characteristics to other tropical savanna species,
   except that seedling emergence is enhanced when seed falls onto recently
   burnt ground during a high rainfall period. In contrast to many
   temperate forest eucalypts, tropical savanna eucalypts lack
   canopy-stored seed banks; time annual seed fall to coincide with the
   onset of predictable wet season rain; have very rare seedling emergence
   events, including a lack of mass germination after each fire; possess an
   abundant sapling bank; and every tropical eucalypt species has the
   ability to maintain canopy structure by epicormically resprouting after
   all but the most intense fires. The combination of poor seedling
   recruitment strategies, coupled with characteristics allowing long-term
   persistence of established plants, indicate tropical savanna eucalypts
   function through the persistence niche rather than the regeneration
   niche. The high rainfall-promoted seedling emergence of C. clarksoniana
   and the reduction of seedling survival and sapling growth by fire,
   support the predictions that grass-tree coexistence in savannas is
   governed by rainfall limiting tree seedling recruitment and regular
   fires limiting the growth of juvenile trees to the canopy.}},

Abstract = {{The Mojave Desert of North America has become fire-prone in recent
   decades due to invasive annual grasses that fuel wildfires following
   years of high rainfall. Perennial species are poorly adapted to fire in
   this system, and post-fire shifts in species composition have been
   substantial but variable across community types. To generalize across a
   range of conditions, we investigated whether simple life-history traits
   could predict how species responded to fire. Further, we classified
   species into plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of
   life-history traits and evaluated whether these groups exhibited a
   consistent fire-response. Six life-history traits varied significantly
   between burned and unburned areas in short (up to 4 years) or long-term
   (up to 52 years) post-fire datasets, including growth form, lifespan,
   seed size, seed dispersal, height, and leaf longevity. Forbs and grasses
   consistently increased in abundance after fire, while cacti were reduced
   and woody species exhibited a variable response. Woody species were
   classified into three PFTs based on combinations of life-history traits.
   Species in Group 1 increased in abundance after fire and were
   characterized by short lifespans, small, wind-dispersed seeds, low
   height, and deciduous leaves. Species in Group 2 were reduced by fire
   and distinguished from Group 1 by longer lifespans and evergreen leaves.
   Group 3 species, which also decreased after fire, were characterized by
   long lifespans, large non-wind dispersed seeds, and taller heights. Our
   results show that PFTs based on life-history traits can reliably predict
   the responses of most species to fire in the Mojave Desert. Dominant,
   long-lived species of this region possess a combination of traits
   limiting their ability to recover, presenting a clear example of how a
   novel disturbance regime may shift selective environmental pressures to
   favor alternative life-history strategies.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of the Leaf-Litter Arthropod Fauna Following Fire in a
   Neotropical Woodland Savanna}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Fire is an important agent of disturbance in tropical savannas, but
   relatively few studies have analyzed how soil-and-litter dwelling
   arthropods respond to fire disturbance despite the critical role these
   organisms play in nutrient cycling and other biogeochemical processes.
   Following the incursion of a fire into a woodland savanna ecological
   reserve in Central Brazil, we monitored the dynamics of litter-arthropod
   populations for nearly two years in one burned and one unburned area of
   the reserve. We also performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to
   determine the effects of fire and litter type on the dynamics of litter
   colonization by arthropods. Overall arthropod abundance, the abundance
   of individual taxa, the richness of taxonomic groups, and the species
   richness of individual taxa (Formiciade) were lower in the burned site.
   However, both the ordinal-level composition of the litter arthropod
   fauna and the species-level composition of the litter ant fauna were not
   dramatically different in the burned and unburned sites. There is
   evidence that seasonality of rainfall interacts with fire, as
   differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were more pronounced in
   the dry than in the wet season. For many taxa the differences in
   abundance between burned and unburned sites were maintained even when
   controlling for litter availability and quality. In contrast,
   differences in abundance for Collembola, Formicidae, and Thysanoptera
   were only detected in the unmanipulated samples, which had a lower
   amount of litter in the burned than in the unburned site throughout most
   of our study period. Together these results suggest that arthropod
   density declines in fire-disturbed areas as a result of direct
   mortality, diminished resources (i.e., reduced litter cover) and less
   favorable microclimate (i.e., increased litter desiccation due to
   reduction in tree cover). Although these effects were transitory, there
   is evidence that the increasingly prevalent fire return interval of only
   1-2 years may jeopardize the long-term conservation of litter arthropod
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically rich savannas and woodlands dominated by Pinus palustris
   once dominated the southeastern U.S. landscape. With European
   settlement, fire suppression, and landscape fragmentation, this
   ecosystem has been reduced in area by 97\%. Half of remnant forests are
   not burned with sufficient frequency, leading to declines in plant and
   animal species richness. For these fire-suppressed ecosystems a major
   regional conservation goal has been ecological restoration, primarily
   through the reinitiation of historic fire regimes. Unfortunately, fire
   reintroduction in long-unburned Longleaf pine stands can have novel,
   undesirable effects. We review case studies of Longleaf pine ecosystem
   restoration, highlighting novel fire behavior, patterns of tree
   mortality, and unintended outcomes resulting from reintroduction of
   fire. Many of these pineland restoration efforts have resulted in
   excessive overstory pine mortality (often >50\%) and produced
   substantial quantities of noxious smoke. The most compelling mechanisms
   of high tree mortality after reintroduction of fire are related to
   smoldering combustion of surface layers of organic matter (duff) around
   the bases of old pines. Development of effective methods to reduce fuels
   and competing vegetation while encouraging native vegetation is a
   restoration challenge common to fire-prone ecosystems worldwide that
   will require understanding of the responses of altered ecosystems to the

Abstract = {{The use of high elevations with deep snow cover presents a challenge to
   mammalian herbivores, which is exacerbated by subalpine vegetation
   dynamics such as slow regrowth following disturbance. We postulated that
   post-fire responses of common wombats (Vombatus ursinus) at high
   elevations would differ from those at low elevations. We examined the
   winter diet of common wombats in the Snowy Mountains in the decade after
   fire in burnt and unburnt areas and compared our results to published
   diet studies from low elevations. Optimal foraging theory predicts that
   as food resources become scarce herbivores respond by widening their
   choice of foods, yet we found that wombats have only marginally wider
   dietary breadth at higher than at lower elevations in terms of plant
   forms and diet breadth in terms of species was not greater. The use of
   shrubs and the tall herb Dianella tasmanica enables wombats to reduce
   the energetic costs of digging for food in snow. Able to survive fire in
   a burrow, the wombat is then capable of responding to reduced foraging
   opportunities following fire by broadening the range of species consumed
   and adopting foraging strategies that exploit temporally improved food
   quality, demonstrated by the greater proportion of grass consumed in

Abstract = {{Today, exotic invasive alien species are considered to be one of the
   greatest threats to biodiversity. However, not all exotic species cause
   negative consequences in the ecosystems in which they settle. In some
   cases, artificial plantations of exotic species can act as a catalyst
   for the regeneration of native species. In southern central Madagascar,
   which has been affected by diverse disturbances (cyclones, logging,
   cultivation), Pinus patula plantations have become environments
   conducive to the regeneration of native species. This study aims to
   assess the level of understory plant diversity in these artificial
   plantations, describe the vegetation dynamics, and examine the effects
   of agricultural practices and logging on vegetation diversity and
   structure. Floristic inventories and biomass measurements were made on
   three types of vegetation that have resulted from previous human-induced
   disturbance: (i) cassava crops established after pine logging; (ii)
   fallows corresponding to cassava crops left fallow for 1-2 years; and
   (iii) post-logging regrowth after pine logging 3-10 years previously.
   Botanical surveys were conducted on 205 10 x 10 m(2) quadrats placed
   along 40 transects. A total of 125 species, 34 of which endemic, from 46
   families were inventoried. The Shannon Weaver index H' values were
   significantly different between post-logging regrowth (H' = 4.01 +/-
   0.67), and cultivated fields (H' = 1.46 +/- 0.23) and fallows (H' = 3.31
   +/- 0.78) (p < 0.001). Agricultural practices, such as tillage regime,
   number of crop-fallow cycles ( > 2 cycles) and number of fire
   occurrences ( > 4 fires) had a greater impact on the reconstitution of
   vegetation than environmental parameters such as slope and topographic
   position. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') and vegetation
   structure parameters (tree density, biomass) were inversely correlated
   with the intensity of disturbance linked to these agricultural
   practices, These results suggest that a low level of disturbance, such
   as that resulting from Pinus tree logging, can act as a catalyst for the
   establishment of native woodlands. Excessive disturbance from
   sylvicultural and agricultural practices, such as frequent burning,
   heavy tillage and high number of crop/fallow cycles, may hinder, but
   does not block, the establishment of native woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What are the effects of fire in native shrubland communities
   and in pine plantations established in these shrublands?
   Location: Northern Patagonia, Argentina.
   Methods: We surveyed four sites in Chall-Huaco valley, located in
   northwest Patagonia. Each site was a vegetation mosaic composed of an
   unburned Pinus ponderosa plantation, a plantation burned in 1996, and an
   unburned matorral and a matorral burned by the same fire. We recorded
   the cover of all vascular plant species. We also analysed species
   richness, total cover, proportion of exotic species, abundance of woody
   species and herb species, cover of exotic species, abundance of woody
   and herb species and differences in composition of species. For both
   shrubs and tree species we recorded the main strategy of regeneration (
   by resprouting or by seed).
   Results: We found that fire had different effects on native matorral and
   pine plantations. Five years after fire, plantations came to be
   dominated by herbs and exotic species, showing differences in floristic
   composition. In contrast, matorral communities remained very similar to
   unburned matorral in terms of species richness, proportion of woody
   species, and herb species and proportion of exotics. Also, pine
   plantations were primarily colonized by seedlings, while matorrals were
   primarily colonized by resprouting.
   Conclusions: Matorrals are highly fire resilient communities, and the
   practice of establishing plantations on matorrals produces a strong
   reduction in the capacity of matorral to return to its original state.
   The elimination of shrubs owing to the effect of plantations can hinder
   regeneration of native ecosystems. Burned plantations may slowly develop
   into ecosystems similar to the native ones, or they may produce a new
   ecosystem dominated by exotic herbs. This study shows that plantations
   of exotic conifers affect native vegetation even after they have been
   removed, as in this case by fire.}},

Abstract = {{Background Many Puerto Rican ecosystems evolved without a regular fire
   regime. As such, many native plants lack adaptations necessary to
   survive even low-intensity fires. Human-caused fires are increasing in
   frequency, in part promoted by the presence of invasive grasses. During
   the afternoon of 19 February 2014, a wildfire burned a large portion of
   the dry forest in El Faro Natural Reserve, Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. Using
   a previously monitored population, we documented the mortality and
   morphological damage on three columnar and semi-epiphytic cactus species
   (Pilosocereus royenii{[}L.] Byles \& Rowley,Harrisia
   portoricensisBritton, andLeptocereus quadricostatusBritton) and one
   globular species (Melocactus intortus{[}Mill.] Urb.) in relation to
   canopy cover and cactus growth strategy. Results Our results suggest
   thatM. intortusandH. portoricensiswere more susceptible to fire damage.
   Cacti growing in areas dominated by grasses and shrubs were
   significantly more likely to burn than those growing under a closed tree
   canopy. Apart fromL. quadricostatus, cacti that survived at least one
   year after the fire had lost spines, developed scarring tissue in some
   or all ribs, and few were able to regrow. Conclusions Because extensive
   tissue damage and environmental alterations were observed during the
   post-fire survey, which occurred between 14 to 19 months after the fire,
   we argue there will be significant delayed mortality and that the
   mortality estimates presented here are conservative.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of regular burning of woodland vegetation in Africa over an
   extended period (46 years) was studied in the Murchison Falls National
   Park, Uganda. Areas identified as having different vegetation types in
   1958 were revisited to analyze vegetation changes and to test the
   prediction that convergence would occur as a result of the regular fire.
   In each of the three vegetation cover types, a transect was analysed.
   Results show that the vegetation cover types have changed and there is
   evidence of vegetation convergence. A detrended correspondence analysis
   (DCA) and a Morisita similarity index analysis showed a good separation
   between the 1958 and 2004 transects for each of the vegetation cover
   types. The DCA also showed that the three 2004 transects were
   compositionally closer to each other than the 1958 transects. The 2004
   transects had also shifted away from the 1958 transects. Whereas in 1958
   compositional similarity was highest between the Terminalia glaucescens
   conversion transect (T2) and the wooded grassland conversion transect
   (T3) (0.86), in 2004 it was most similar between the transects closest
   to Wairingo river (T1 and T2, correlation coefficient of 0.80). T1 was
   referred to as the Terminalia woodland transect. Comparing the 2004
   transects to the 1958 transects, a low compositional similarity was
   observed. The highest was between T3-1958 and T3-2004 (0.62).

   transect) were identified in 2004 than in 1958 and, the transects shared
   more species in 2004 than in 1958. All the big trees (DBH >= 30 cm) that
   existed along T1 in 1958 died off. Clustering of individual woody
   plants, a protective mechanism used by plants in presence of fire, was
   identified in each of the plots analysed.
   To counterbalance the unifying effect of fire for the vegetation in the
   area and to maintain diverse vegetation, a variety of fire management
   regimes are needed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a key process in eucalypt communities, exerting a strong
   influence on the composition, structure and functioning of forests. Much
   of the research on the fire response of temperate, wet-sclerophyll trees
   in Australia comes from Victoria, where the dominant eucalypt is
   Eucalyptus regnans. In contrast, central and northern Tasmanian forests,
   dominated by Eucalyptus delegatensis, are relatively understudied. There
   is a need to determine whether Tasmanian wet-sclerophyll forests, though
   the same forest type in name, are functionally different in floristics
   and response to fire. Here we document the forest community response to
   a natural wildfire event in Tasmania-using opportunistic before/after
   control/impact (BACI) data from pre-existing monitoring plots. Uniting
   pre- and post-fire floristic data, we quantified mortality and
   regeneration of eucalypt, acacia and other dominant tree species, and
   tree ferns, Dicksonia antarctica, in response to wildfire. We also
   evaluated the density of eucalypt and acacia seedling establishment
   between burnt and unburnt forests, and quantified faunal responses to
   fire. Despite moderate-to-high intensity burning in patches across the
   plot, mortality of eucalypts, acacias and tree ferns due to fire were
   low. By contrast, fire-sensitive rainforest species showed low survival,
   though were able to persist in unburnt refugia. Eucalypt and acacia
   seedling regeneration was high in the burnt plot, suggesting that E.
   delegatensis forests regenerate without stand-replacing fire events.
   This contrasts to Victorian E. regnans forests, whose persistence is
   dependent on high-severity stand-replacing events. We also found some
   group-specific avifaunal and invertebrate responses to the fire event,
   which are broadly reflective of responses documented in other
   Victorian-based studies. Our results have implications for Tasmanian
   wet-forest silvicultural practices, which are based on the principle of
   stand-replacement after fire. The broader relevance of this work to
   forest ecology is in demonstrating the serendipitous opportunities that
   can arise with baseline monitoring plots.}},

Abstract = {{Land owners and managers across the western United States are
   increasingly searching for methods to evaluate and mitigate the effects
   of woodland encroachment on sagebrush steppe ecosystems. We used
   small-plot scale (0.5 m(2)) rainfall simulations and measures of
   vegetation, ground cover, and soils to investigate woodland response to
   tree removal (prescribed fire and mastication) at two late-succession
   woodlands. We also evaluated the effects of burning on soil water
   repellency and effectiveness of aggregate stability indices to detect
   changes in erosion potential. Plots were located in interspaces between
   tree and shrub canopies and on undercanopy tree and shrub microsites.
   Erosion from untreated interspaces in the two woodlands differed more
   than 6-fold, and erosion responses to prescribed burning differed by
   woodland site. High-intensity rainfall (102 mm . h(-1)) on the less
   erodible woodland generated amplified runoff and erosion from tree
   microsites postfire, but erosion (45-75 g . m(-2)) was minor relative to
   the 3-13-fold fire-induced increase in erosion on tree microsites at the
   highly erodible site (240 295 g . m(-2)). Burning the highly erodible
   woodland also generated a 7-fold increase in erosion from shrub
   microsites (220-230 g .m(-2)) and 280-350 g . m(-2) erosion from
   interspaces. High levels of runoff (40-45 mm) and soil erosion (230-275
   g . m(-2)) on unburned interspaces at the more erodible site were
   reduced 4-5-fold (10 mm and 50 g . m(-2)) by masticated tree material.
   The results demonstrate that similarly degraded conditions at
   woodland-encroached sites may elicit differing hydrologic and erosion
   responses to treatment and that treatment decisions should consider
   inherent site-specific erodibility when evaluating tree-removal
   alternatives. Strong soil water repellency was detected from 0 cm to 3
   cm soil depth underneath unburned tree canopies at both woodlands and
   its strength was not altered by burning. However, fire removal of litter
   exacerbated repellency effects on infiltration, runoff generation, and
   erosion. The aggregate stability index method detected differences in
   relative soil stability between areas underneath trees and in the
   intercanopy at both sites, but failed to provide any indication of
   between-site differences in erodibility or the effects of burning on
   soil erosion potential.}},

Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{182-191}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Forest wildfires can severely affect the soil faunal community. We
   hypothesised that the recovery of soil animals after a fire would occur
   through (1) immigration from the unburnt forest into the burnt area and
   (2) survival in less-burnt patches or deep soil layers. To test the rate
   of recovery, and whether immigration or survival was the main recovery
   factor, we studied soil macrofauna after two wildfires occurring in 2001
   in central Sweden and north-western Russia. The animals were studied up
   to 2007 by taking soil and litter samples including unburnt and burnt
   forest plots 20 and 60 m from the edge of the unburnt forest. Total
   abundance and species richness was 1.5-5 times higher in the unburnt
   than in the burnt areas shortly after fire. Animals in deep soil layers
   had a better survival after fire than surfaced-welling species. The
   burnt area was colonised within a few months by flying insects, mostly
   dipterans. When the post-fire vegetation had established after 1-2
   years, plant-feeding groups like aphids, cicadellids and thripses became
   even more abundant than in the unburnt forest. Millipedes established
   faster in the area close to the forest edge than in the central part of
   the fire area indicating migration from the forest edge, but most
   slow-dispersing soil animals seemed to recover through survival in the
   burnt area. The biomass of both microbi-detritivores and predators
   showed a delayed recovery in the burnt area and had only reached 40-60\%
   of that in the unburnt forest six years after the wild-fire, indicating
   reduced habitat quality for the former and food shortage for the latter

Abstract = {{In this study, the post-fire regeneration of three coniferous species
   (Pinus brutia, Cupressus sempervirens and Cupressus arizonica) was
   examined in the peri-urban forest of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece. The
   wildfire took place in July 1997 and burned almost 60\% of the forest
   vegetation. During the autumn of 2010, 34 experimental plots were
   established in all aspects within the burned area. In each experimental
   plot the following measurements were carried out: height, diameter at
   breast height and crown projection in two perpendicular diameters. The
   results show that the Pinus brutia individuals, most of which came from
   natural regeneration, presented the best growth, in relation to the two
   other species in all aspects. As for Cupressus sempervirens, equal parts
   of which came from natural and artificial regeneration was characterized
   by remarkable growth especially in the Northeastern aspect. Finally,
   Cupressus arizonica existed in all aspects except the Northeastern. It
   also presented a satisfactory development, especially on the Southern
   aspect. Fourteen years after the fire pure or mixed stands of the above

Abstract = {{Aim We investigate the response of vegetation composition and plant
   diversity to increasing land clearance, burning and agriculture at the
   MesolithicNeolithic transition (c. 64005000 bc) when first farming was
   introduced. Location The Valais, a dry alpine valley in Switzerland.
   Methods We combine high-resolution pollen, microscopic charcoal and
   sedimentological data to reconstruct past vegetation, fire and land use.
   Pollen evenness, rarefaction-based and accumulation-based palynological
   richness analyses were used to reconstruct past trends in plant
   diversity. Results Our results show that from c. 5500 cal. yr bc,
   slash-and-burn activities created a more open landscape for agriculture,
   at the expense of Pinus and Betula forests. Land clearance by
   slash-and-burn promoted diverse grassland ecosystems, while on the long
   term it reduced woodland and forest diversity, affecting important tree
   species such as Ulmus and Tilia. Main conclusions Understanding the
   resilience of Alpine ecosystems to past disturbance variability is
   relevant for future nature conservation plans. Our study suggests that
   forecasted land abandonment in the Alps will lead to pre-Neolithic
   conditions, with significant biodiversity losses in abandoned grassland
   ecosystems. Thus, management measures for biodiversity, such as
   ecological compensation areas, are needed in agricultural landscapes
   with a millennial history of human impact, such as the non-boreal
   European lowlands. Our study supports the hypothesis that species
   coexistence is maximized at an intermediate level of disturbances. For
   instance, species richness decreased when fire exceeded the
   quasi-natural variability observed during the Mesolithic times. Under a
   more natural disturbance regime, rather closed Pinus sylvestris and
   mixed oak forests would prevail.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of herbaceous and woody plants from tropical woodland,
   savanna, and monsoon forest were analysed to determine the impact of
   environmental factors (nutrient and water availability, fire) and
   biological factors (microbial associations, systematics) on plant
   delta(15)N values. Foliar delta(15)N values of herbaceous and woody
   species were not related to growth form or phenology, but a strong
   relationship existed between mycorrhizal status and plant delta(15)N. In
   woodland and savanna, woody species with ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   associations and putative N-2-fixing species with ECM/arbuscular (AM)
   associations had lowest foliar delta(15)N values (1.0-0.6parts per
   thousand), AM species had mostly intermediate delta(15)N values (average
   +0.6parts per thousand), while non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae had highest
   delta(15)N values (+2.9 to +4.1parts per thousand). Similar differences
   in foliar delta(15)N were observed between AM (average 0.1 and 0.2parts
   per thousand) and non-mycorrhizal (average +0.8 and +0.3parts per
   thousand) herbaceous species in woodland and savanna. Leguminous savanna
   species had significantly higher leaf N contents (1.8-2.5\% N) than
   non-fixing species (0.9-1.2\% N) indicating substantial N acquisition
   via N-2 fixation. Monsoon forest species had similar leaf N contents
   (average 2.4\% N) and positive delta(15)N values (+0.9 to +2.4parts per
   thousand). Soil nitrification and plant NO3- use was substantially
   higher in monsoon forest than in woodland or savanna. In the studied
   communities, higher soil N content and nitrification rates were
   associated with more positive soil delta(15)N and plant delta(15)N. In
   support of this notion, Ficus, a high NO3- using taxa associated with
   NO3- rich sites in the savanna, had the highest delta(15)N values of all
   AM species in the savanna. delta(15)N of xylem sap was examined as a
   tool for studying plant delta(15)N relations. delta(15)N of xylem sap
   varied seasonally and between differently aged Acacia and other savanna
   species. Plants from annually burnt savanna had significantly higher
   delta(15)N values compared to plants from less frequently burnt savanna,
   suggesting that foliar N-15 natural abundance could be used as marker
   for assessing historic fire regimes. Australian woodland and savanna
   species had low leaf delta(15)N and N content compared to species from
   equivalent African communities indicating that Australian biota are the
   more N depauperate. The largest differences in leaf delta(15)N occurred
   between the dominant ECM Australian and African savanna (miombo)
   species, which were depleted and enriched in N-15, respectively. While
   the depleted delta(15)N of Australian ECM species are similar to those
   of previous reports on ECM species in natural plant communities, the
   N-15-enriched delta(15)N of African ECM species represent an anomaly.}},

Abstract = {{This opportunistic study compares the vegetation, fuel loads and
   vertebrate fauna of part of a 120-ha block of tropical open forest
   protected from fire for 23 years, and an adjacent block burnt annually
   over this period. Total fuel loads did not differ significantly between
   the unburnt and annually burnt sites, but their composition was markedly
   different, with far less grassy fuel, but far more litter fuel, in the
   unburnt block. There were major differences between treatments in the
   composition of trees and shrubs, manifest particularly in the number of
   stems. There was no overall difference in plant species richness between
   the two treatments, but richness of woody species was far higher in the
   unburnt treatment, and of annual and perennial grasses, and perennial
   herbs in the annually burnt treatment. Change in plant species
   composition from annually burnt to unburnt treatment was directional, in
   that there was a far higher representation of rainforest-associated
   species (with the percentage of woody stems attributable to `rainforest'
   species increasing from 24\% of all species in the annually burnt
   treatment to 43\% in the unburnt treatment, that of basal area from 9\%
   to 30\%, that of species richness from 8\% to 17\%, and that of cover
   from 12 to 47\%). The vertebrate species composition varied
   significantly between treatments, but there was relatively little
   difference in species richness (other than for a slightly richer reptile
   fauna in the unburnt treatment). Again, there was a tendency for species
   that were more common in the unburnt treatment to be
   rainforest-associated species. The results from this study suggest that
   there is a sizeable and distinct set of species that are associated with
   relatively long-unburnt environments, and hence that are strongly
   disadvantaged under contemporary fire regimes. We suggest that such
   species need to be better accommodated by fire management through
   strategic reductions in the frequency of burning.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are increasing in frequency, severity, and size in many parts

   watershed hydrology by restructuring forest composition and structure.
   Topography is an important factor in snowpack accumulation and ablation
   as it influences exposure to solar radiation and atmospheric conditions.
   Few direct measurements of post-fire snowpack have been taken and none
   to this date that evaluate how topographical aspect influences the
   effect of forest fire on snowpack accumulation and ablation. We set up a
   two-year experiment on the Twitchell Canyon fire in south-central Utah
   on both north and south facing aspects and burned and unburned forest
   conditions across three replicated blocks. There was a significant
   interaction between burn condition and aspect for snow depth in which
   there was a reduction in snow depth in burned areas on south facing
   aspects but not on northern facing aspects. Snowpack disappeared earlier
   in burned areas than unburned areas, particularly on south facing
   slopes. Snow water equivalence (SWE) did not vary between burned and
   unburned forest. Year and topographical aspect were primary drivers of
   both snow depth and SWE. A review of five similar studies suggests that
   sites at southern latitudes and lower elevations could be more
   susceptible to reduction in snowpack after wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{High yield commercial forests are an important source of fiber for
   global forest product needs and the southeastern United States is a key
   region for global wood supply needs with intensively managed pine stands
   (Pinus spp.) an important component of forested landscapes in this
   region. Concern has arisen over possible effects of stand establishment
   practices on vegetation communities within commercial forests,
   particularly relative to use of herbicides and burning. Therefore, we
   examined response of plant communities to site preparation within
   intensively managed pine stands in eastern Louisiana, USA that were
   either prescribe burned (PF; n = 5) or treated with a combination of
   herbicides (imazapyr and triclopyr) and prescribe burned (PFH; n = 5)
   during 2002. We used 5 m line intercepts (n = 10 per stand) to quantify
   species richness, diversity, and relative abundance of plant species for
   3 years post-treatment (2003-2005) with a repeated measures analysis of
   variance. We documented 80 genera or species of plants and neither
   species richness nor diversity differed between treatments. Site
   preparation with PFH appeared to promote development of an herbaceous
   plant community and reduced relative abundance of woody plants, whereas
   PF-treated sites were dominated by woody vegetation. Our results
   demonstrate that different plant communities result from PF and PFH site
   preparation and may place stands on different successional trajectories.
   We suggest PFH site preparation may increase availability of early
   successional vegetation associations on managed forest landscapes and
   may extend the time stands stay in this successional stage. However,
   increased crop tree growth from site preparation may shorten open canopy
   conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation of Kings Park, near the centre of Perth, Western
   Australia, once had an overstorey of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) or
   Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart), and many trees still remain in the
   bushland parts of the Park. Avenues and roadsides have been planted with
   eastern Australian species, including Eucalyptus cladocalyx (sugar gum)
   and Eucalyptus botryoides (southern mahogany), both of which have become
   invasive. The present study examined the effect of a recent burn on the
   level of herbivory on these native and exotic eucalypts. Leaf damage,
   shoot extension and number of new leaves were measured on tagged shoots
   of saplings of each tree species in unburnt and burnt areas over an
   8-month period. Leaf macronutrient levels were quantified and the number
   of arthropods on saplings was measured at the end of the recording
   period by chemical knockdown. Leaf macronutrients were mostly higher in
   all four species in the burnt area, and this was associated with
   generally higher numbers of canopy arthropods and greater levels of leaf
   damage. It is suggested that the pulse of soil nutrients after the fire
   resulted in more nutrient-rich foliage, which in turn was more palatable
   to arthropods. The resulting high levels of herbivory possibly led to
   reduced shoot extension of E. gomphocephala, E. botryoides and, to a
   lesser extent, E. cladocalyx. This acts as a negative feedback mechanism
   that lessens the tendency for lush, post-fire regrowth to outcompete
   other species of plants. There was no consistent difference in the
   levels of the various types of leaf damage or of arthropods on the
   native and the exotic eucalypts, suggesting that freedom from herbivory
   is not contributing to the invasiveness of the two exotic species.}},

Abstract = {{Indonesian peatland forest is considered a huge sink of tropical carbon
   and thereby make significant contribution to global terrestrial carbon
   storage. However, landcover and landuse changes in this ecosystem have
   incurred a synergistic exposure to drought and wildfires. Deforestation
   and forest degradation through combustion and decomposition of forest
   biomass and soil carbon have become global issues because of their
   greenhouse gas contribution to global climate change. Thus fire-driven
   carbon losses in these peatlands have increased the need to evaluate the
   impacts of fire at a landscape scale. In 6-10 week dry periods from
   January to April 2014 and in January 2015, wildfires burnt peatland
   forest in Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan province (Indonesian Borneo). An
   assessment was conducted to provide more reliable estimates of the
   effects of fire on aboveground and soil carbon losses and their dynamics
   in the coastal peatlands of the province. Carbon loss from combustion of
   both aboveground biomass and peat soil was substantial. Moreover, CO2
   emission from soil respiration at the burnt peat surface increased 46\%
   over the first 9 months after the fire. This study clearly showed the
   magnitude of fire-driven carbon loss and the scale of CO2 emission to
   the atmosphere arising from fire in tropical peatland forest.}},

Abstract = {{The Northwest Florida coastal landscape consists of a mosaic of sand
   pine scrub, longleaf pine, and ecotonal communities. Fire suppression
   has altered the structure and composition of these communities. The
   effects of environmental variation and the recent reintroduction of fire

   investigated. Relative cover of herbaceous and woody ground cover
   species and density of sapling and canopy trees along with elevation,
   percent bare ground, percent canopy cover, and litter depth were
   determined in burned and long-unburned treatments for all community
   types. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified elevation and
   time since fire as the most influential environmental variables for
   species distribution and abundance. Species most closely associated with
   lower sites included Gaylussacia mosieri Small, Ilex glabra (L.) Gray,
   Kalmia hirsuta Wait., Magnolia virginiana L., Pinus palustrus P. Mill.,

Abstract = {{This is a study of the re-accumulation of bushfire fuels following both
   prescribed lire of low fireline intensity (<700 kW m(-1)) and wildfire
   of high intensity (>10,000 kW m(-1)) in Australian Eucalyptus open
   forests of differing annual rainfall. Repeated measurements over 5 to 7
   years of litter, elevated fuels, coarse woody debris, and bark revealed
   more rapid fuel recovery in higher rainfall forests compared with lower
   rainfall forests, following prescribed fire. In prescribed-burnt forests
   with mean annual rainfall 900-950 mm all fuel categories recovered to
   very high within seven years, with elevated fuels exceeding pre-fire
   loads by up to 200\%. No fuels in prescribed-burnt forests with mean
   annual rainfall 600-650 mm recovered to pre-fire loads after six years
   suggesting that rainfall is an important driver of the rate of fuels
   recovery. High intensity wildfire in lower rainfall forests (600-650 mm)
   stimulated the rapid recovery of elevated fuels to over 600\% of
   pre-fire loads - effectively transforming open forest formations into
   shrublands over the 6 years after fire. The recovery of elevated fuels
   following both prescribed fire in high rainfall forests and wildfire in
   low rainfall forests did not follow a gradual negative exponential
   increase often approximated by an Olson curve, but peaked early after
   fires. This suggests that the Olson recovery function, the default for
   predicting loads for these fuels in the operational fire behaviour
   models in use in south-eastern Australia, may not be appropriate in all
   cases. Fire simulations were run for forests burnt in wildfires using
   default (forest) and observed (shrubland) vegetation types. Under
   weather conditions similar to the previous wildfire, predictions for
   fireline intensities and the rate of spread would be at least 50\%
   greater in transitional shrubland than forest, emphasizing the
   importance of accounting for vegetation dynamics for safe response
   management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shifting cultivation is a predominant practice in the majority of
   tropical hilly tracts. Relatively few studies have examined forest
   recovery following shifting cultivation and we have reviewed these
   studies to identify and synthesize general recovery patterns. Most
   studies report that, although pioneer tree species recover relatively
   faster, woody biomass of mature forest trees recovers several decades
   after suspension of cultivation. Analysis of bird-species inventories in
   10 studies revealed that up to 70\% of mature forest birds may recover
   in successional sites and that species composition is about 55\% similar
   to that in mature forests within 25 years. Results of mammal studies
   were likely to have been confounded by hunting effects and therefore the
   effect of time since suspension of cultivation and hunting impacts need
   to be investigated separately. As shown by a few studies, we conclude
   that community recovery can be expected to be accelerated when
   relatively large forest tracts adjoin a shifting cultivation landscape,
   in comparison with recovery in sites with shorter fallow cycles in the
   absence of contiguous forests, which act as sources for recolonization
   of fauna and vegetation.}},

   to analyse the properties of the ground vegetation over the succession
   from open forest land to closed forest communities. The clearest
   differences in diversity between the seminatural forests mainly
   influenced by fire and managed forests occurred in the early stages of
   succession. Forest management appeared to increase the species richness
   at the beginning of succession. The seminatural stands were rich in
   Cladonia lichens and dwarf shrubs up until tree canopy closure; however,
   the abundance of mosses was lower in the seminatural stands. Forest
   management favoured an abundance of grasses, notably Deschampsia

   Mycelial survival was investigated in two ways. First, we sampled
   seedlings in areas where these species had fruited abundantly before the
   fire, and second, we collected and genotyped mushrooms of S. pungens.
   Neither species was detected on seedlings within the areas sampled, and
   A. francheti was not detected in any above- or below-ground samples
   after the fire. Genetic evidence from S. pungens revealed that post-fire
   genets were small and numerous, and none were found to be identical to
   the genets sampled prior to the fire.
   From these results we conclude that A. francheti was not a common

Abstract = {{Forest fires are shaping forest vegetation and landscape in many parts

   and identification of fire prone areas were done on the basis of
   historical ground fire data in conjunction with satellite remote sensing
   data provided by NRSA. The composition, structure and diversity of
   different forest fire zones was conducted by stratified random sampling
   to measure trees, saplings, seedlings, shrubs, herbs and litter. The
   regeneration pattern of the different forest fire zones was prepared by
   graphical population structures. The fuel load for each fire zones was
   estimated. The duffs litter and wood litter of all fire zones were
   weighed separately. Along the fire gradients the tree species exhibited
   highest density of seedlings in low fire zone. The highest density of
   saplings and trees were present in non-fire zone whereas shrubs and
   herbs layer showed the highest density in medium fire zone. In this
   study we found that non-fire zone contained more species as compared to
   burnt areas. The diversity pattern showed that the medium fire zone
   showed maximum diversity followed by non-fire zone, whereas low fire
   zone had minimum Shannon index. The regeneration pattern of tree species
   in all the fire zones and non-fire zone generally showed five general
   patterns. In the high fire zone the seedlings were much affected which
   will result discontinuation of conversion into saplings with the

Abstract = {{Questions (a) In which ways do woody species encroachment and fire

   We collected data on vegetation and seed bank composition in 4 m(2)
   plots in 16 shrub-encroached grasslands and adjacent open grassland.
   Data were analyzed with regard to the impact of woody species
   encroachment (native vs non-native) and fire on grassland vegetation and
   the seed bank using NMDS and LME models combined with ANOVA and Tukey
   contrast tests. Results Encroachment was accompanied by a decrease in
   plant species diversity and altered microclimatic conditions. There was
   a lack of sufficient evidence for a difference in effect size between
   native and non-native woody species on tested vegetation or seed bank
   parameters. While the effects of fire on vegetation were weak compared
   to encroachment, burning failed to reduce the cover of woody species

   significantly in species composition and diversity, indicating a limited
   potential for restoration from the seed bank alone. Conclusions To halt
   secondary succession in Transylvanian grassland sustainably, we suggest
   the establishment of a post-fire management regime including the cutting
   of woody species and/or re-introduction of grazing and mowing. Grassland
   restoration from the seed bank may be supported by the introduction of

Abstract = {{There is a prevailing paradigm that woody vegetation is expanding at the
   expense of grassland with reduced burning under pastoralism in the Mulga
   Lands biogeographic region in eastern Australia. This raises the
   possibility that the region is acting as a carbon sink. Vegetation
   boundaries were precisely positioned from rail survey plans dating from
   1895 to 1900. This baseline was compared with the position of boundaries
   on 1952 aerial photography and 2010 Google Earth imagery. The conversion
   of forest to non-forest by mechanical clearing was also mapped from
   satellite imagery. There was no consistent trend in the direction of
   boundary movement for mulga (Acacia aneura F. Muell. ex Benth.), gidgee
   (Acacia cambagei R. T. Baker) forest or miscellaneous other forest
   types. The stability of the boundaries, despite the transition from
   aboriginal management to rangeland pastoralism, contrasts with dramatic
   declines in tree cover resulting from mechanical clearing. Mapping of
   forest cover from satellite imagery reveals that conversion of forest to
   non-forest has reduced mulga forest to 74\%, gidgee forest to 30\% and
   miscellaneous forest types to 82\% of their original area. Annual
   clearing rates for the period between 1997 and 2005 were 0.83, 0.95 and
   0.43\% for those forest types, respectively. Clearing has declined
   substantially in the period 2005-09 since the advent of recent
   regulations in Queensland. The area remains a source of carbon emissions

Abstract = {{Fire is a natural feature of many ecosystems, with some vegetation types
   highly adapted to fire. However, very little is known about the effect
   of fire on spiders, especially as fires have become more frequent owing
   to human activity. We determine whether different spider functional
   guilds (web builders vs. wanderers) respond differently to fires in the
   sclerophyllous fynbos. We determine also the effect of rockiness as
   refuge for these guilds and whether it influences their post-fire
   recovery. There were three site categories of time-since-last fire: 3
   months, 1 year, and 7 years. We found that fire caused a decline in
   spider richness and abundance, with the 3-month category supporting the
   lowest. In sites that were burned within 1 year, abundance of wanderers
   was as high as in sites that had 7 years to recover, whereas species
   richness and abundance of web builders in sites that were burned 1 year
   ago were as low as in recently burned sites. However, assemblages of
   wanderers differed among categories, while no differences were observed
   for web builders, highlighting that wanderers took longer time to
   recover than web builders. Species richness and abundance of both guilds
   were not affected by different levels of rockiness. However, rockiness
   is important in shaping assemblages of wanderers. The results emphasize
   that the assemblages of greatest conservation concern with increased
   fire frequencies are wanderers and are candidate surrogates for
   monitoring post-fire recovery. These results highlight the need to allow
   fynbos vegetation to recover fully between fire intervals and draws
   attention to the dangers of frequent unplanned fires.}},

Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{The short- and long-term post-fire response patterns of small mammals,
   reptiles and amphibians inhabiting mallee woodlands and heathlands in
   temperate Australia are reviewed with respect to species' life history
   parameters in a search for unifying trends. Pyric response patterns of
   small mammal species are closely lied to their shelter, food and
   breeding requirements. There is a trend of increased specificity and
   reduced flexibility in life history traits concomitant with increased
   impact of fire and later post-fire recolonization. For reptiles there
   appears to be a strong relationship between the shelter and foraging
   requirements of species and their abundance in various successional
   states. The high incidence of burrowing in the mallee/heath amphibian
   fauna imparts considerable resilience to fire, and most species'
   abundance and distribution patterns seem more closely linked to moisture
   regimes than to fire per se.
   The high degree of consistency between species' post-fire response
   patterns and their life history parameters points to the feasibility of
   developing a model to predict the impact of fire on small vertebrates.
   Such a model is currently being developed}},

Title = {{Peatland Wildfire Severity and Post-fire Gaseous Carbon Fluxes}},
Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{The future status of peatlands as carbon stores/sinks is uncertain given
   current and predicted environmental change. Several factors can affect
   the magnitude of the peatland carbon sink including disturbances such as
   wildfire. There is at present little evidence of how wildfire affects
   the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) via perturbation
   to aerobic and anaerobic respiration. The greatest effects, which are
   likely to vary according to wildfire severity, would be expected in the
   immediate post-fire stages when little recovery has taken place. Here,
   we investigate five UK peatland wildfires (2011-2012) in the immediate
   post-wildfire period measuring CO(2)and CH(4)fluxes using static
   chambers. Fire severity was described using a modified form of the
   composite burn index. A hierarchical partitioning approach indicated
   time since fire was the most strongly associated variable that fluxes of
   both CO2, and CH(4)followed by soil temperature for CO(2)and fire
   severity for CH4. Using a liner mixed modelling approach to account for
   repeated measures; fire severity was a significant term for CH(4)and
   borderline significant for CO2. Mean fluxes of CH(4)were consistently
   lower on burnt sites. In contrast, data from a fire in the north of
   Scotland appeared to show the opposite relationship for CH(4)with higher
   fluxes on the burnt sites. These results suggest that wildfire can
   affect gaseous carbon fluxes, but the responses can be variable in both
   space and time and that disruption to anaerobic processes may be site
   and/or fire dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical dry forests experience the highest deforestation rates on
   Earth, with major implications for the biodiversity of these ecosystems,
   as well as for its human occupants. Global remote sensing based forest
   cover data (2000 2012) point to the rapid loss of tropical dry forest in
   South America and Africa, also, if not foremost, inside formally
   protected areas. Here, we significantly extend the baseline of tropical
   dry forest loss inside a protected area in Ghana using a generalizable
   change detection technique. The forest cover change detection is based
   on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from
   historical Landsat data (1984-2015). Field measurements were carried out
   in dry semi-deciduous forest and in the adjacent savanna and woodland.
   Estimates of the canopy area index and above ground woody biomass were
   related to NDVI derived from Landsat 8 data. The change detection
   indicated significant NDVI decrease in a large area initially covered by
   tropical dry forest, associated with deforestation. The peak in
   deforestation was found to have occurred between 1990 and 2002,
   hereafter, the conservation status of the area was improved. A
   combination of remote sensing data corroborated by secondary data
   sources provides evidence for the almost complete clearance of a
   tropical dry forest inside a strictly protected area, attributable to
   logging and land clearing for arable farming. The NDVI change detection
   also revealed NDVI increase in the adjacent woodlands from 2002 to 2015,
   demonstrating woody encroachment. Historical fire data from the MODIS
   burned area product indicate that the deforested area experienced a high
   frequency of anthropogenic burning since 2004, which may have caused
   further degradation and largely prevents forest regeneration. The
   results show the ongoing destruction of tropical ecosystems even within
   ostensibly protected areas and ask for the revision of protection and
   management strategies of such areas.}},

   was negatively related to the occurrence of pests, likely because
   sapwood desiccation and loss of nutrient impede brood development. About
   33.3\% of the fire-scorched pines died. The results recommend the

Abstract = {{Climate change is projected to increase fire severity and frequency in
   the boreal forest, but it could also directly affect post-fire
   recruitment processes by impacting seed production, germination, and
   seedling growth and survival. We reviewed current knowledge regarding
   the effects of high temperatures and water deficits on post-fire
   recruitment processes of four major tree species (Picea mariana, Pinus
   banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Betula papyrifera) in order to
   anticipate the effects of climate change on forest recovery following
   fire in the boreal biome. We also produced maps of future vulnerability
   of post-fire recruitment by combining tree distributions in Canada with
   projections of temperature, moisture index and fire regime for the
   2041-2070 and 2071-2100 periods. Although our review reveals that
   information is lacking for some regeneration stages, it highlights the
   response variability to climate conditions between species. The
   recruitment process of black spruce is likely to be the most affected by
   rising temperatures and water deficits, but more tolerant species are
   also at risk of being impacted by projected climate conditions. Our maps
   suggest that in eastern Canada, tree species will be vulnerable mainly
   to projected increases in temperature, while forests will be affected
   mostly by droughts in western Canada. Conifer-dominated forests are at
   risk of becoming less productive than they currently are, and
   eventually, timber supplies from deciduous species-dominated forests
   could also decrease. Our vulnerability maps are useful for prioritizing
   areas where regeneration monitoring efforts and adaptive measures could
   be developed.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{267-285}},
Abstract = {{Fire can considerably change hydrological processes, increasing the risk
   of extreme flooding and erosion events. Although hydrological processes
   are largely affected by scale, catchment-scale studies on the
   hydrological impact of fire in Europe are scarce, and nested approaches
   are rarely used. We performed a catchment-scale experimental fire to
   improve insight into the drivers of fire impact on hydrology. In
   north-central Portugal, rainfall, canopy interception, streamflow and
   soil moisture were monitored in small shrub-covered paired catchments
   pre- and post-fire. The shrub cover was medium dense to dense (44 to 84
   \%) and pre-fire canopy interception was on average 48.7\% of total
   rainfall. Fire increased streamflow volumes 1.6 times more than
   predicted, resulting in increased runoff coefficients and changed
   rainfall-streamflow relationships - although the increase in streamflow
   per unit rainfall was only significant at the subcatchment-scale. Fire
   also fastened the response of topsoil moisture to rainfall from 2.7 to
   2.1 h (p = 0.058), and caused more rapid drying of topsoils after rain
   events. Since soil physical changes due to fire were not apparent, we
   suggest that changes resulting from vegetation removal played an
   important role in increasing streamflow after fire. Results stress that
   fire impact on hydrology is largely affected by scale, highlight the
   hydrological impact of fire on small scales, and emphasize the risk of
   overestimating fire impact when upscaling plot-scale studies to the
   catchment-scale. Finally, they increase understanding of the processes
   contributing to post-fire flooding and erosion events.}},

   Spectral Indices Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Identifying fire-affected areas is of key importance to support
   post-fire management strategies and account for the environmental impact
   of fires. The availability of high spatial and temporal resolution
   optical satellite data enables the development of procedures for
   detailed and prompt post-fire mapping. This study proposes a novel
   approach for integrating multiple spectral indices to generate more
   accurate burned area maps by exploiting Sentinel-2 images. This approach
   aims to develop a procedure to combine multiple spectral indices using
   an adaptive thresholding method and proposes an agreement index to map
   the burned areas by optimizing omission and commission errors. The
   approach has been tested for the burned area classification of four
   study areas in Italy. The proposed agreement index combines multiple
   spectral indices to select the actual burned pixels, to balance the
   omission and commission errors, and to optimize the overall accuracy.
   The results showed the spectral indices singularly performed differently
   in the four study areas and that high levels of commission errors were
   achieved, especially for wildfires which occurred during the fall season
   (up to 0.93) Furthermore, the agreement index showed a good level of
   accuracy (minimum 0.65, maximum 0.96) for all the study areas, improving
   the performance compared to assessing the indices individually. This
   suggests the possibility of testing the methodology on a large set of
   wildfire cases in different environmental conditions to support the
   decision-making process. Exploiting the high resolution of optical
   satellite data, this work contributes to improving the production of
   detailed burned area maps, which could be integrated into operational
   services based on the use of Earth Observation products for burned area
   mapping to support the decision-making process.}},

Abstract = {{Waratah (Telopea speciosissima) post-fire floral displays are a
   prominent feature of the landscape in Royal National Park and elsewhere
   in southeastern Australia, but factors governing the persistence of the
   species are poorly known. We examined long term patterns of fecundity,
   recruitment and survival of waratahs in Royal NP in relation to two
   major wildfires. Flowering occurred mainly over 3 years following both
   the 1994 and 2001 fires, but fewer plants flowered, fewer seeds were
   produced and fewer seedlings established after the 2001 fire. After the
   1994 fire, limited seed dispersal resulted in most seedlings
   establishing near fruiting individuals. Only 14\% of the plants that
   established as seedlings after the 1994 fire survived the 2001 fire. At
   the time of the 2001 fire, these plants were 4-6 years old and post-fire
   survival was highest in older plants. A logistic model predicts that it
   would take 5.9 (95\% CI 5.4-7.5) years of growth after germination for
   plants to have greater than 25\% survival probability if burnt
   (equivalent to a fire return period of about 9 years). Waratahs are long
   lived, have long primary juvenile periods and occasional opportunities
   for recruitment. Each fire may not lead to successful recruitment. While
   recruitment failure after one or more fires may not be significant,
   understanding the proximate factors that limit recruitment is important
   to predict the impact of long term changes such as altered fire regimes

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{455}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Altered climate and changing fire regimes are synergistically impacting
   forest communities globally, resulting in deviations from historical
   norms and creation of novel successional dynamics. These changes are
   particularly important when considering the stability of a keystone
   species such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), which
   contributes critical ecosystem services across its broad North American
   range. As a relatively drought intolerant species, projected changes of
   altered precipitation timing, amount, and type (e.g. snow or rain) may
   influence aspen response to fire, especially in moisture-limited and
   winter precipitation-dominated portions of its range. Aspen is generally
   considered an early-seral species that benefits from fire, but increases
   in fire activity across much of the western United States could affect
   the species in unpredictable ways. This study examined post-fire aspen
   stands across a regional climate gradient spanning from the
   north-central Great Basin to the northeastern portion of the Greater
   Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA). We investigated the influence of seasonal
   precipitation and temperature variables, snowpack, and site conditions
   (e.g. browsing levels, topography) on density of post-fire aspen
   regeneration (i.e. all small trees ha(-1)) and recruitment (i.e. small
   trees >= 2 m tall ha(-1)) across 15 fires that occurred between 2000 and
   2009. The range of post-fire regeneration (2500-71,600 small trees
   ha(-1)) and recruitment (0-32,500 small trees >= 2 m ha(-1)) densities
   varied widely across plots. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated
   that both response variables increased primarily with early winter
   (Oct-Dec) precipitation during the `fire-regen period' (i.e., fire year
   and five years after fire) relative to the 30-year mean. The 30-year
   mean of early winter precipitation and fire-regen period snowpack were
   also positively related to recruitment densities. Both response
   variables decreased with higher shrub cover, highlighting the importance
   of considering shrub competition in post-fire environments. Regeneration
   and recruitment densities were negatively related to proportion browsed
   aspen leaders and animal pellet densities (no./m(2)), respectively,
   indicating the influence of ungulate browsing even at the relatively low
   levels observed across sites. A post-hoc exploratory analysis suggests
   that deviation in early winter precipitation during the fire-regen
   period (relative to 30-year means) varied among sites along directional
   gradients, emphasizing the need to consider multiple spatiotemporal
   scales when investigating climate effects on post-fire successional
   dynamics. We discuss our findings in terms of dynamic management and
   conservation strategies in light of changing fire regimes and climate
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Models based on functional traits have limited power in predicting how
   animal populations respond to disturbance because they do not capture
   the range of demographic and biological factors that drive population
   dynamics, including variation in trophic interactions. I tested the
   hypothesis that successional changes in vegetation structure, which
   affected invertebrate abundance, would influence growth rates and body
   condition in the early-successional, insectivorous gecko Nephrurus
   stellatus. I captured geckos at 17 woodland sites spanning a succession
   gradient from 2 to 48 years post-fire. Body condition and growth rates
   were analysed as a function of the best-fitting fire-related predictor
   (invertebrate abundance or time since fire) with different combinations
   of the co-variates age, sex and location. Body condition in the whole
   population was positively affected by increasing invertebrate abundance
   and, in the adult population, this effect was most pronounced for
   females. There was strong support for a decline in growth rates in
   weight with time since fire. The results suggest that increased
   early-successional invertebrate abundance has filtered through to a
   higher trophic level with physiological benefits for insectivorous
   geckos. I integrated the new findings about trophic interactions into a
   general conceptual model of mechanisms underlying post-fire population
   dynamics based on a long-term research programme. The model highlights
   how greater food availability during early succession could drive rapid
   population growth by contributing to previously reported enhanced

   may reduce tree densities, the extent to which they will restore native
   biodiversity and community composition, particularly in woodlands
   invaded by exotic annual grasses, is unclear. We evaluated the effects
   of juniper cutting in two experiments of disturbance type (slash piles
   and skid trails) followed by three native seeding treatments (cultivar,
   locally sourced, and no seed) on vegetation in central Oregon. Prior to
   cutting, native perennial grass cover and richness were positively
   associated and exotic grass cover was negatively associated with juniper
   basal area. After cutting and 2 yr after seeding, species composition
   was altered for both disturbance types. Some seeded areas had higher
   total species richness, higher native species richness, higher cover of
   seeded species, and higher overall cover compared to areas that were not
   seeded. But seeding effectiveness in mitigating exotic species spread
   varied based on exotic species functional group, pretreatment propagule
   pressure, and experiment disturbance type. Neither seed mix lowered
   exotic grass cover. There was limited evidence that the cultivar mix
   outperformed the locally sourced native seed mix. In the short term,
   fuel reduction activities may have facilitated further conversion of
   this woodland to an exotic grassland, but longer-term evaluation is
   needed. In juniper woodlands that have been invaded by exotic species,
   fuel reduction activities may facilitate further invasion, and exotic
   species control may be needed to limit invasion and promote native
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The retention of seeds in the plant canopy for one to 30 years or more
   is termed serotiny. It is well represented floristically and
   physiognomically in fire-prone, nutrient-poor and seasonally-dry
   sclerophyll vegetation in Australia, and to a lesser extent, South
   Africa followed by North America. While the seed-storing structures vary
   greatly, all will release their propagules following exposure to the
   heat of a fire (pyriscence). This phenomenon can be contrasted with seed
   release at maturity (non-storage) and soil storage of seeds. Although
   the evolutionary requirements for serotiny are clear, its adaptive
   advantages over other seed storage syndromes are largely the subject of
   conjecture in the absence of comparative experiments. Nine hypotheses
   were assessed here. Canopy storage maximises the quantity of seeds
   available for the next post-fire generation (unlike non-storage).
   Synchronized post-fire release satiates post-dispersal granivores
   (unlike non-storage and soil storage) and ensures arrival on a seed bed
   conducive to seedling recruitment (unlike non-storage). Canopy stored
   seeds are better insulated from the heat of a fire than non-stored, and
   probably soil-stored, seeds. Fluctuating annual seed crops, the
   opportunity for post-fire wind-dispersal, the possible advantages of
   dense stands of adults, short lifespan of the dispersed seeds and their
   optimal location in the soil for germination have only a limited role in
   explaining the advantages of serotiny. It is concluded that canopy seed
   storage is favoured in regions where seed production is restricted and
   inter-fire establishment and maturation are unlikely. In addition, these
   regions have a reliable seasonal rainfall and are subjected to intense
   fires at intervals occurring within the reproductive lifespan of the
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire land degradation is oft en attributed to fire-induced soil
   water repellency, despite the fact that soil water repellency is a
   natural phenomenon in many soils and is therefore not necessarily caused
   by fire. To improve our understanding of the role of soil water
   repellency in causing fire-induced land degradation, a long-term
   monitoring study was performed in which the temporal variation of
   topsoil water repellency (0-2.5-cm depth) was captured in a Portuguese
   shrubland before and aft er fire between November 2007 and March 2010.
   In addition, similarities and dissimilarities between changes following
   burning and clipping were assessed in a plot experiment. Soil water
   repellency appeared to be the rule rather than the exception, both
   before and aft er fire, and was strongly related to soil moisture and
   organic matter content. Surprisingly, despite the low soil temperatures
   during the fire (60 degrees C) and the lack of direct soil moisture
   changes, fire significantly increased the persistence of soil water
   repellency (the water drop penetration time). Vegetation removal by
   burning and clipping played a key role in determining post-fire water
   repellency in litter and at the soil surface and considerably reduced
   the time needed to both develop and eliminate water repellency of the
   litter and surface soil. Where pre-fire (or ``natural{''}) soil water
   repellency is abundant, an increase in erosion aft er fire cannot be
   solely caused by soil water repellency. Nevertheless, fire-induced
   removal of the protective canopy cover may increase the hydrologic
   significance of soil water repellency in burned landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyses factors influencing soil erodibility in a grassland
   area of the humid tropics subject to frequent wildfires. The
   interrelationships between aggregate stability, soil physicochemical
   properties and pore size characteristics are examined. At the multifire
   scale aggregate stability was significantly (P > 0.01) correlated with
   cation exchange capacity (CEC) (R = 0.76) and, in order of explained
   variance, exchangeable magnesium, aluminium, potassium, calcium and
   hydrogen concentration. At the individual fire scale only CEC and
   exchangeable magnesium had a significant ameliorating influence in the
   more recently burnt areas, whilst both exchangeable magnesium and
   calcium were significant in the area of longest post-fire recovery. At
   the multifire scale aggregate, stability was also significantly
   correlated with soil texture and organic matter partly through their
   influence on CEC. These interactions between aggregate stability and
   soil physicochemical properties influence soil drainage, and low but
   significant correlations were recorded between aggregate stability and
   total porosity (R = 0.55 P > 0.05) and the relative proportion of
   transmission pores to storage pores (R = 0.44 P greater than or equal to
   0.05). Water release curves showed that areas with the longest post-fire
   recovery times held higher amounts of water at most suctions and hence
   contained a greater volume of pores of different sizes, than more
   recently burnt areas. Soil erodibility in wildfire prone areas therefore
   reflects complex interactions and feedbacks between soil physicochemical
   properties, aggregate stability and pore size characteristics which vary
   spatially and with time as soil and vegetation recovery progresses. (C)

Abstract = {{The Andean cloud forest is a critical part of the Neotropics and much of
   its structure, function and dynamics are in response to both natural and
   human-caused disturbances. Those natural disturbances include
   landslides, and tree death leading to trees falling and creating gaps in
   the canopy. The human-caused disturbances include logging, mining, road
   construction and other aspects of urbanization as well as slash-and-burn
   forest clearing techniques before cultivation (e.g., in sugarcane
   {[}Saccharum officinarum], in banana {[}Musasp.] and/or in coffee
   {[}Coffea arabica]). When yields decline in those cultivated areas
   cattle often graze in them creating pastures, with or without the
   planting of exotic grasses such asSetaria sphacelata. Here I first
   explore definitions of disturbance and then review all published
   research on disturbances in the Andean cloud forest and the responses of
   the abiotic and biotic components of those ecosystems, which include
   plant replacements. Next, I expand on conceptual models of plant
   community dynamics by refashioning the traditional disturbance = >
   response paradigm into nine classes of plant-plant replacements.
   Finally, I present 6 years of baseline data showing the plant-plant
   replacements in a one-hectare plot in undisturbed Andean cloud forest in
   Ecuador. I suggest that those replacements be used to facilitate future
   research through comparison with the plant-plant replacements in
   disturbed Andean cloud forests recovering after both natural and
   human-caused disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Historical patterns of wildfires are being altered as a result of
   changing climate and therefore are becoming an increasingly pressing
   global issue. How small mammals deal physiologically with changes in
   landscape and food availability due to fire remains largely unknown,
   although recent studies on small heterothermic terrestrial mammals have
   shown an increase in post-fire torpor use to reduce energy and foraging
   requirements. However, data on the behavioural and physiological
   responses of bats after fires are scarce, although potentially these
   volant species may differ from terrestrial mammals. Therefore, we
   investigated the post-fire thermal biology and activity of lesser
   long-eared bats (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) using temperature-telemetry in
   Warrumbungle National Park, NSW, which experienced a devastating
   wildfire in 2013. The study comprised two field seasons, one in 2013
   within 4 months after the fire, and one in 2015 two years after the fire
   to identify potential changes in behaviour and physiology.
   Interestingly, soon after the fire, bats showed significantly shorter
   torpor bout duration (11.8 +/- A 12.5 h) and longer normothermia
   duration (8.7 +/- A 4.6 h) in comparison to those in 2015 (torpor bout
   duration: 24.1 +/- A 23.5 h; normothermia duration: 2.5 +/- A 1.5 h).
   Insect availability was significantly (20-fold) higher in 2013 than in
   2015, which was likely an important factor resulting in the short
   average torpor bout duration by N. geoffroyi after the fire. Our data
   indicate that volant bats appear to show the opposite post-fire
   behavioural and physiological responses to small terrestrial mammals,
   showing longer normothermic and active periods and shorter torpor bouts
   to capitalise on an increase in available post-fire resources.}},

Abstract = {{Mulching is increasingly employed to stabilize burnt areas, making
   necessary to elucidate where and how it should be used. The effects of
   mulching and the efficiency of two straw application strategies in
   reducing nutrient losses were evaluated in a steep area (burnt with
   moderate severity) with twelve experimental plots split into three sets:
   control burnt plots (BS), burnt plots with straw mulching in narrow
   bands along the contour lines (NM, global dose 800 kg ha(-1)) and in
   wide bands (WM, global dose 1000 kg ha(-1)). None of the mulching
   strategies had a significant effect on most of the 16 soil and sediment
   variables analysed (pH, nutrient and trace element concentrations). The
   principal component analyses show that soil and sediment samples change
   with time after the fire regardless treatment, decreasing progressively
   the differences between successive sampling dates. In sediments,
   pH(KCl), Ca, Mg, Mn and Zn fitted to curvilinear regression models with
   time after fire as independent variable, while the other variables
   showed no clear temporal trend. During the first post-fire year, <500 kg
   ha(-1) of sediments were eroded and mulching had no effect on the total
   mass of lost sediment's and nutrients. We conclude that the erosion rate
   was rather low that year due to moderate precipitation rates and
   therefore mulching did not significantly reduce soil erosion.
   Nevertheless, the concentration of Mo, Mn and Zn in sediments exceeded
   reference levels for ecosystem protection and can lead to deficiency

Abstract = {{Fire is an integral disturbance shaping forest community dynamics over
   large scales. However, understanding the relationship between fire
   induced habitat disturbance and biodiversity remain equivocal.
   Ecological theories including the intermediate disturbance hypothesis
   (IDH) and the habitat accommodation model (HAM) offer predictive
   frameworks that could explain faunal responses to fire disturbances. We
   used an 80 year post-fire chronosequence to investigate small reptile
   community responses to fires in temperate forests across 74 sites.
   First, we evaluated if changes in species richness, abundance and
   evenness post-fire followed trends of prior predictions, including the
   IDH. Second, using competing models of fine scale habitat elements we
   evaluated the specific ways which fire influenced small reptiles. Third,
   we evaluated support for the HAM by examining compositional changes of
   reptile community post-fire. Relative abundance was positively
   correlated to age post-fire while richness and evenness showed no
   associations. The abundance trend was as expected based on the prior
   prediction of sustained population increase post-disturbance, but the
   trend for richness contradicted the prediction of highest diversity at
   intermediate levels of disturbance (according to IDH). Abundance changes
   were driven mainly by changes in overstorey, ground layer, and shelter,
   while richness and evenness did not associate with any vegetation
   parameter. Community composition was not strongly correlated to age
   since fire, thus support for the HAM was weak. Overall, in this
   ecosystem, frequent fire disturbances can be detrimental to small
   reptiles. Future studies utilizing approaches based on species traits
   could enhance our understanding of biodiversity patterns
   post-disturbance.}},

Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{51-60}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Seedlings are expected to be particularly sensitive to the environmental
   conditions at the time of establishment. Within succession,
   environmental conditions vary over time and a species will have a better
   chance to regenerate on a particular place depending on the intrinsic
   traits that determine its regeneration niche. We examined the
   regeneration niche and the pattern of seedling establishment along
   succession of the main species present in a Mediterranean shrubland. The
   establishment of Cistus albidus, Rosmarinus officinalis and Ulex
   parviflorus was monitored for three years using seasonal cohorts in
   three different stages along a successional gradient (post-fire,
   building and mature). There was a flush of establishment immediately
   after fire in all species. After this event, there was a decline in
   establishment as succession progressed, until practically no seedling
   establishment was found at mature stages. The presence of a thick litter
   layer probably precluded seedling establishment at this stage. The
   establishment of Cistus was very closely tied to the post-fire
   environment, while recruitment of Rosmarinus and Ulex also occurred in
   the building stage. in contrast to what has been reported in other
   Mediterranean shrublands, recruitment in our study area was not
   restricted solely to post-fire stages, and shrubs also recruited
   opportunistically when open gaps in the canopy were available along
   succession. The differences in preferred micro-sites for the
   establishment suggest a differentiation in regeneration niches and a
   particular set of environmental conditions where the different species
   would be particularly competitive through succession. Thus, Cistus
   regenerates mostly in highly perturbed environments, whereas Ulex and
   Rosmarinus benefit from environments with longer inter-fire periods. (C)

Abstract = {{Elevated global temperatures are expected to alter vegetation dynamics
   by interacting with physiological processes, biotic relationships and
   disturbance regimes. However, few studies have explicitly modeled the
   effects of these interactions on rates of vegetation change, despite
   such information being critical to forecasting temporal patterns in
   vegetation dynamics. In this study, we build and parameterize
   rate-change models for three dominant alpine life forms using data from
   a 7-year warming experiment. These models allowed us to examine how the
   interactions between experimental warming, the abundance of bare ground
   (a measure of past disturbance) and neighboring life forms (a measure of
   life form interaction) affect rates of cover change in alpine shrubs,
   graminoids and forbs. We show that experimental warming altered rates of
   life form cover change by reducing the negative effects of neighboring
   life forms and positive effects of bare ground. Furthermore, we show
   that our models can predict the observed direction and rate of life form
   cover change at burned and unburned long-term monitoring sites. Model
   simulations revealed that warming in unburned vegetation is expected to
   result in increased forb and shrub cover and decreased graminoid cover.
   In contrast, in burned vegetation, warming is predicted to slow
   post-fire regeneration in both graminoids and forbs and facilitate rapid
   expansion in shrub cover. These findings illustrate the applicability of
   modeling rates of vegetation change using experimental data. Our results
   also highlight the need to account for both disturbance and the
   abundance of other life forms when examining and forecasting vegetation
   dynamics under climatic change.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we examined seed supply (seed banks and seed rain) and

   specifically examined density of native and cultivated grass seeds and
   plants in areas of high, moderate, and low fire severity. We also
   examined the similarity between density of native and cultivated grass
   seeds to density of above ground plants. Density of native grass seed
   per square meter was higher in areas that burned under low fire severity
   (85.18 +/- 44.83) compared to areas of moderate (18.52 +/- 11.26) and
   high (7.41 +/- 4.90) fire severity; however, differences were not
   statistically significant due, in part, to the high error associated
   with estimates. Density of cultivated grass seed per square meter was
   higher than that of native grass seed in areas of high (439.60 +/-
   117.98) and moderate (437.02 +/- 146.50) fire severity, areas that were

   Density of seeded grass plants per square meter was also higher than

   that seeds from cultivated grasses are more likely to establish as

   cultivated grasses following a wildfire may slow or inhibit recovery of
   native grasses in the short term. Longer-term implications for site

Title = {{Managing heterogeneity: the importance of grazing and environmental
   variation on post-fire succession in heathlands}},

Abstract = {{1. Semi-natural habitats have been shaped by human disturbance regimes
   for centuries. Spatially and temporally heterogeneous land-use
   practices, such as cutting, burning, grazing and turf-cutting, have
   resulted in complex mosaic landscapes that are of high priority for
   conservation in Europe. Contemporary conservation subjects these systems
   to management regimes that are generally less diverse, in terms of
   disturbances and fine-scale temporal and spatial variability, than
   traditional land use, but the ecological consequences of these
   simplifications are unclear.
   2. We investigated the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant
   species composition and diversity along local environmental (moisture)
   gradients in coastal heathlands. A replicated series of post-fire
   successions (n = 12) was initiated in three heathland habitats and the
   areas subjected to two grazing regimes. Floristic and environmental data
   were recorded in permanent plots over a 5-year period. Community data
   were analysed using multivariate ordination techniques (principal
   components analysis, partial redundancy analyses, and principal response
   curves) and generalized linear models.
   3. Fire induced strong successional trends in the species composition of
   the heathlands. These trends differed among heathland habitats, and with
   grazing. Strong interactions between fire, habitat and grazing implied
   that the effect of grazing on the successional dynamics differed among
   habitats. Species diversity decreased in the first year after fire but
   increased beyond the pre-fire levels during succession. This trend was
   not affected by local environment or grazing, although there were main
   effect differences in diversity between environments and grazing
   regimes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the two
   management practices do not have simple additive effects within the
   semi-natural system studied, as grazing created ecological opportunities
   for additional sets of species, increased variability among habitats,
   and added complexity to the post-fire successional dynamics. In order to
   preserve diversity, conservation management should thus aim to preserve
   the level of complexity of the traditional management regimes, both in
   terms of the actual disturbances (e.g. fire and grazing) as well as the
   spatial scales at which they are applied. Further, the considerable
   change in these effects along the local environmental gradient brings
   into question the efficiency of general management prescriptions, and
   indicates that local environmental variability should be taken into
   account in the conservation of semi-natural habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This paper reviews the most recent literature related to the use
   of remote sensing (RS) data in wildland fire management. Recent Findings
   Studies dealing with pre-fire assessment, active fire detection, and
   fire effect monitoring are reviewed in this paper. The analysis follows
   the different fire management categories: fire prevention, detection,
   and post-fire assessment. Extracting the main trends from each of these
   temporal sections, recent RS literature shows growing support of the
   combined use of different sensors, particularly optical and radar data
   and lidar and optical passive images. Dedicated fire sensors have been
   developed in the last years, but still, most fire products are derived
   from sensors that were designed for other purposes. Therefore, the needs
   of fire managers are not always met, both in terms of spatial and
   temporal scales, favouring global over local scales because of the
   spatial resolution of existing sensors. Lidar use on fuel types and
   post-fire regeneration is more local, and mostly not operational, but
   future satellite lidar systems may help to obtain operational products.
   Regional and global scales are also combined in the last years,
   emphasizing the needs of using upscaling and merging methods to reduce
   uncertainties of global products. Validation is indicated as a critical
   phase of any new RS-based product. It should be based on the independent
   reference information acquired from statistically derived samples. The
   main challenges of using RS for fire management rely on the need to
   improve the integration of sensors and methods to meet user
   requirements, uncertainty characterization of products, and greater
   efforts on statistical validation approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses the effects of post-dispersal predation of Pinus
   nigra seeds on the initial recruitment of this species in areas burned
   by large wildfires, where P. nigra shows very low regeneration. In three
   different habitats obtained in a gradient of time since fire in
   Catalonia (NE Spain), we have evaluated the effects of seed predators
   (ants, rodents and birds) on post-dispersal seed removal and early
   seedling establishment of P. nigra by using selective exclosures
   limiting their access to seeds. Ants were the most efficient seed
   predator group, followed by rodents and birds. The contribution of each
   group to overall predation showed large seasonal variations. The first
   seeds dispersed in winter were mainly predated by rodents, which also
   registered their highest abundance in this season of the year. In
   spring, at the end of the natural dissemination period of P. nigra
   seeds, ants became the major predators, this fact coinciding with their
   increased abundance. Birds showed the lowest predation values. In the
   seedling establishment experiment, only in the exclusion treatment of
   the three predator groups was there initial establishment in all
   habitats, especially in the recently burned area, where there was
   seedling establishment in all exclusion treatments. The post-dispersal
   seed predation by different animal groups and low seedling emergence in
   the different habitats obtained in this study, together with the low
   seed availability of P. nigra seeds in burned areas, do not predict a
   favourable outlook for the natural post-fire recolonization of this
   species, which might even affect its overall distribution area in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Siren (1955) studied understorey species composition, tree stand
   properties and humus-layer thickness in 64 unlogged forest stands on
   topographically and pedologically comparable sites. The stands were of
   even age (6 - 300 yr), stocked with the first or second tree generation
   after wildfire. The view of Siren and several authors after him, that
   the vegetation of old-growth boreal Picea forests is homogeneous on a
   broad scale. was examined by applying, in parallel, the partial variants
   of two ordination methods (DCA and PCA) to Siren's vegetation data. Two
   main vegetation gradients were found: a major gradient running from
   recently burnt plots with prominence of pioneer species to plots with
   stand age > 100 yr, a well stocked tree layer and a thick humus layer,
   dominance of feather-mosses and ample occurrence of shade-tolerant as
   well as light-preferring vascular plant species, and a second gradient
   along which first- and second-generation plots segregate. The more
   prominent element of Betula trees in first- than in second-generation
   stands < 100 yr contributed to the latter. A minor third gradient
   related to humus-layer thickness was recovered by partial DCA only. The
   main vegetation gradient reappeared in separate ordinations of data from
   47 mature forest stands (> 100 yr), but without being correlated with
   forest age. Variation among mature-forest stands in the importance of
   pioneer species is considered mainly to be brought about by fine-scale
   disturbance processes such as tree uprooting. Increasing importance of
   factors operating on within-stand scales {[}development of a varied gap
   structure and stronger gradients in tree influence (radiation at ground
   level), soil moisture, soil depth and nutrient availability] with time
   is also reflected in the second and third mature-forest ordination axes.
   Possible implications of the results for conservation of biological
   diversity and monitoring of changes in boreal forests are discussed.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{323-334}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Few studies have examined impacts of fire on invertebrates in southern
   California ecosystems despite the fact they harbor diverse invertebrate
   assemblages with many narrowly endemic species. California sage scrub,
   an endangered ecosystem type of low-elevation areas in southern
   California, is increasingly threatened by altered fire regimes and type
   conversion to non-native grasslands often resulting from fire
   disturbances. The effect of fire on ant assemblages in a patch of
   recovering sage scrub was examined by using adjacent intact sage scrub
   and non-native grassland habitats as checks. While short-term effects in
   ant activity potentially associated with temporary changes in habitat
   structure and abiotic conditions were observed, ant assemblages in the
   burned area did not differ between summer 2013 (pre-fire) and fall 2013
   (post-fire), or between spring 2013 (pre-fire) and spring 2014
   (post-fire). Results indicated that either the ant assemblages recover
   quickly, or more likely, pre-existing ant assemblage remained and were
   not directly impacted by fire. Our results, combined with the few other
   studies that examined impacts of fire on sage scrub invertebrates, are
   consistent with an emerging hypothesis that ground-dwelling
   ant/invertebrate assemblages are little affected by direct impacts of
   fire in semi-arid systems and areas where fires are common.}},

Title = {{Effects of wildfires on peak discharges in watersheds}},
Journal = {{IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{302-307}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires can alter the hydrological processes in watersheds resulting
   in increases in peak discharge - one of the most important hydrological
   variables used in water resources applications. It follows that standard
   methods used for assessing the rainfall runoff should be modified in
   order to model the potential changes in watershed response under
   post-fire conditions. However, no reliable methodology for
   quantitatively assessing the effects of wildfires on hydrological
   parameters (such as curve numbers or runoff coefficients) has been
   identified to date. The approaches currently used are usually
   site-specific, mainly based on personal experience or very simple
   empirical strategies, and therefore affected by a degree of uncertainty.
   This paper addresses the estimation of the Soil Conservation Service
   Curve Number (SCS-CN or CN) in the district of San Giuliano, L'Aquila
   (central Italy), a small urban basin recently affected by a wildfire
   leading to a significant reduction in forest cover. The effects of the
   fire on runoff were modeled by adjusting CNs according to existing
   approaches from the literature in order to perform a sensitivity
   analysis for post-fire conditions; this allowed to examine the effects
   of the variability in model input parameters (estimates of post-fire
   CNs) upon expected peak discharges related to different return period
   storms. The fire effect ratio, which can be seen as a global parameter
   for describing alterations in the watershed response due to fire, is
   calculated by dividing post-fire peak discharge by prefire peak
   discharge. For the present case study, this ratio ranged between 1.1 and
   2.3, indicating the urgent need for quantitative research on the effects
   of wildfires on the hydrological variables affecting runoff
   calculations.}},

Pages = {{32-39}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Successful multi-use planning for forested landscapes requires an
   understanding of timber management effects on wildlife species.
   Lungless, woodland salamanders depend on forested habitats and are
   sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture associated with many
   forestry practices. Additionally, woodland salamanders are territorial
   and have relatively low vagility, making it unlikely that they can
   successfully migrate to more favorable habitat when the surrounding
   forest is harvested. Therefore, we examined the abundance of the Western
   Slimy Salamander, Plethodon albagula, in an experimentally manipulated
   forest in central Missouri. We used artificial cover object searches to
   compare salamander abundance in three replicate treatments that were
   clear-cut then burned to reduce maple regeneration, clear-cut and not
   burned, partially harvested, and un-manipulated control forest. We
   captured a total of 300 Western Slimy Salamanders between April 2007 and
   September 2011. We found significantly fewer salamanders in the burn and
   clear-cut treatments compared with the partial and control treatments.
   We also found a lower proportion of juveniles and had fewer recaptures
   in the burn and clear-cut than in the partial and control treatments.
   Consistent with other studies of woodland salamanders, our results
   suggest that for at least the first 7 years post-harvest, clear-cutting
   is detrimental to woodland salamander populations. This initial
   reduction in abundance combined with the further reduced proportion of
   juveniles may have longer lasting effects even as the forest
   regenerates. Finally, it appears that timber harvest resulting in
   limited canopy thinning may be compatible with maintaining populations
   of Western Slimy Salamanders in Missouri. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Obtaining quantitative information about the recovery of fire-affected
   ecosystems is of utmost importance from the management and
   decision-making point of view. Nowadays the concern about natural
   environment protection and recovery is much greater than in the past.
   However, the resources and tools available for its management are still
   not sufficient. Thus, attention and precision is needed when decisions
   must be taken. Quantitative estimates on how the vegetation is
   recovering after a fire can be of help for evaluating the necessity of
   human intervention on the fire-affected ecosystem, and their importance
   will grow as the problem of forest fires, climate change and
   desertification increases.
   This article performs a comparison of methods to extract quantitative
   estimates of vegetation cover regrowth with Landsat TM and ETM+ data in
   an area that burned during the summer of 1998 in the Liguria region
   (Italy). In order to eliminate possible sources of error, a thorough
   pre-processing was carried out, including a careful geometric correction
   (reaching RMSE lower than 0.3 pixels), a topographic correction by means
   of a constrained Minnaert model and a combination of absolute and
   relative atmospheric correction methods. Pseudo Invariant Features (PIF)
   were identified by implementing an automated selection method based in
   temporal Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which has been called
   multi-Temporal n-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis (mT-nD-PCA).
   Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) was compared against quantitative
   vegetation indices which are based on well known traditional vegetation
   indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified
   Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI). Accuracy assessment was
   performed by regressing vegetation cover results obtained with each
   method against field data gathered during the fieldwork campaign carried
   out in the study area. Results obtained showed how vegetation cover
   fractions extracted from the NDVI based quantitative index were the most
   accurate, being superior to the rest of the techniques applied,

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{168}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{It is often suggested that habitat attributes and interspecific
   interactions can cause non-random species co-occurrence patterns, but
   quantifying their contributions can be difficult. Null models that
   systematically exclude and include habitat effects can give information
   on the contribution of these factors to community assembly. In the
   boreal forest, saproxylic beetles are known to be attracted to recently
   burned forests where they breed in dead and dying trees. We examined
   whether species co-occurrences of saproxylic beetles that develop in,
   and emerge from, boles of recently burned trees show non-random
   patterns. We also estimated the extent to which both the post-fire
   habitat attributes and interspecific interactions among beetles
   contribute to such patterns. We sampled tree boles encompassing key
   attributes (tree species, tree size/dbh and burn severity) that are
   thought to characterize species-habitat associations of saproxylic
   beetles, a proposition that we tested using indicator species analysis.
   Two null models with no habitat constraints ({''}unconstrained{''})
   indicated that a total of 29.4\% of the species pairs tested had
   significant co-occurrence patterns. Habitat-constrained null models
   indicated that most of the detected species aggregations (72\%) and
   segregations (59\%) can be explained by shared and distinct
   species-habitat relationships, respectively. The assembly pattern was
   also driven by interspecific interactions, of which some were modulated
   by habitat; for example, predator and prey species tended to co-occur in
   large-sized trees (a proxy of available bark/wood food resource
   primarily for the prey). In addition, some species segregation
   suggesting antagonistic, competitive, or prey-predator interactions were
   evident after accounting for the species' affinities for the same tree
   species. Overall, our results suggest that an intimate link between
   habitat and interspecific interactions can have important roles for
   community assembly of saproxylic assemblages even following disturbance
   by fire. We also show that a systematic application of null models can
   offer insight into the mechanisms behind the assembly of ecological
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Banksia woodlands are renowned for their flammability and prescribed
   fire is increasingly employed to reduce the risk of wildfire and to
   protect life and property, particularly where these woodlands occur on
   the urban interface. Prescribed fire is also employed as a tool for
   protecting biodiversity assets but can have adverse impacts on native
   plant communities. We investigated changes in species richness and cover
   in native and introduced flora following autumn prescribed fire in a
   700-hectare Banksia/Tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) woodland that had
   not burnt for more than 30 years. Effectiveness of management techniques
   at reducing weed cover and the impacts of grazing by Western Grey
   Kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) postfire were also investigated. Thirty
   plots were established across a designated burn boundary immediately
   before a prescribed fire in May 2011, and species richness and cover
   were measured 3 years after the fire, in spring of 2013. Fencing
   treatments were established immediately following the fire, and weed
   management treatments were applied annually in winter over the
   subsequent 3 years. Our results indicate that autumn prescribed fire can
   facilitate increases in weed cover, but management techniques can limit
   the establishment of targeted weeds postfire. Postfire grazing was found
   to have significant adverse impacts on native species cover and
   vegetation structure, but it also limited establishment of some serious
   weeds including Pigface (Carpobrotus edulis). Manipulating herbivores in
   time and space following prescribed fire could be an important and

   and deposition of incompletely combusted plant structures and litter on
   the soil surface. A further 6.7 Mg C ha(-1) was emitted to the
   atmosphere, mostly from the on-ground and near surface components of
   litter, coarse woody debris and understorey. Overall, these E. obliqua
   forests sequester around 244 Mg C ha(-1) to 30 cm soil depth (excluding
   woody roots) and planned burning transferred about 3\% of this C to the
   atmosphere and a further 3\% was transformed to charred and fragmented
   organic matter and deposited on the soil surface. Estimating long term C
   balance of burnt forests will require a much better understanding of the
   decay characteristics of these charred organic materials and good
   measures of post-fire aboveground carbon accumulation. The more intense
   a fire becomes the greater will be C emission from coarse woody debris
   and understorey, indicating the importance of quantifying these
   components in emission estimates for more intense planned burns and for
   wildfires. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are important contributors of C, N, and Hg to the
   atmosphere. In the fall of 2011, a large wildfire occurred in northern
   Minnesota and we were able to quickly access the area to sample the
   forest floor and mineral soil for C, N, and Hg pools. When compared with
   unburned reference soils, the mean loss of C resulting from fire in the
   forest floor and the upper 20 cm of mineral soil was 19.3 Mg ha(-1), for
   N the mean loss was 0.17 Mg ha(-1), and for Hg the mean loss was 9.3 g
   ha(-1). To assess the influence of fire severity on the forest floor and
   mineral soils, we used an established method that included a soil burn
   severity index and a tree burn severity index with a gradient of
   severity classes. It was apparent that the unburned reference class had
   greater forest floor C, N, and Hg pools and higher C/N ratios than the
   burned classes. The C/N ratios of the 0- to 10- and 10- to 20-cm mineral
   soils in the unburned reference class were also greater than in the
   burned classes, indicating that a small amount of C was lost and/or N
   was gained, potentially through leaching unburned forest floor material.
   However, with a couple of exceptions, the severity classes were unable
   to differentiate the forest floor and mineral soil impacts among soil
   burn and tree burn severity indices. Developing burn severity indices
   that are reflective of soil elemental impacts is an important first step
   in scaling ecosystem impacts both within and across fire events.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding consequences of changes in climate and fire regimes for
   succession in plant communities is critical for conservation planning at
   broad spatial and temporal scales. We selected two sites that burned in
   high-severity fire decades ago and studied succession in the woody plant
   community and its variations across two environmental gradients;
   elevation and distance from a lower-severity/unburned edge. By
   overlaying an ordination of data for woody species on the modeled
   environmental gradient most closely related to variation in communities,
   we analyzed the interaction of life-history traits of species and
   landscape heterogeneity at each study site. Species that resprout from
   surviving roots were widespread across the distance gradient 28 years
   after the La Mesa fire in New Mexico. Species that reproduce from
   off-site seed, including Pinus ponderosa, were more prevalent where
   resprouters (e.g., Quercus) were less important in defining communities.
   At Saddle Mountain, Arizona, 45 years post-fire, we observed
   neighborhood interactions across the elevation gradient, for example,
   where shade-tolerant conifers (e.g., Abies concolor) occurred in
   understories of Populus tremuloides. At both sites, greater cover of
   woody plants that reproduce from off-site seed at shorter distances from
   a lower-severity/unburned edge suggested migration of these species
   following the model of wave-form succession. In contrast to studies that
   emphasize undesirable effects when forest transitions to openings and
   alternative habitats, our research elucidates the need for further
   consideration of both young forest communities and the persistent
   species and communities described as landscape scars in conservation
   plans for forest systems of the southwestern United States.}},

Abstract = {{The existing fire scar detection methods based on multi-temporal
   analysis only used the difference in either backscattering intensity or
   polarimetric characteristics between the pre- and post-fire PolSAR data
   to calculate the difference image (DI), and then applied an object-based
   image analysis approach (OBIA) to generate the fire scar binary map.
   These methods all ignored the polarimetric correlation between both the
   pre- and post-fire PolSAR data. And many parameters of the OBIA method
   were determined empirically. Therefore, this study proposes a new
   detection method, which integrates the Hotelling-Lawley trace (HLT)
   statistic with a hierarchical automatic image segmentation method
   (GGKI-MRF). The HLT can simultaneously capture changes in both
   polarimetry and intensity, which helps to distinguish between burned and
   unburned areas. And the GGKI-MRF method is developed by combining the
   generalized Gaussian-based Kittler-Illingworth (GG-KI) thresholding with
   Markov Random Field (MRF) model, which has a good performance in
   reducing the isolate points (false alarms) and the omission errors. The
   experimental results from multi-temporal and polarimetric PALSAR PolSAR
   data show that the proposed method can achieve high detection accuracy
   (i.e., the kappa coefficient of 0.81 and the overall accuracy up to
   0.92).}},

Abstract = {{Premise Pyrophilous fungi form aboveground fruiting structures
   (ascocarps) following wildfires, but their ecology, natural history, and
   life cycles in the absence of wildfires are largely unknown.
   Sphaerosporella is considered to be pyrophilous. This study explores
   Sphaerosporella ascocarp appearance following a rare 2016 wildfire in
   the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP), compares the timing of
   ascocarp formation with recovery of Sphaerosporella DNA sequences in
   soils, and explores the association of Sphaerosporella with post-fire
   Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens) seedlings.
   Methods Burned sites in the GSMNP were surveyed for pyrophilous fungal
   ascocarps over 2 years. Ascocarps, mycorrhizae, and endophyte cultures
   were evaluated morphologically and by Sanger sequencing of the nuclear
   ribosomal ITS gene region (fungal barcode; Schoch et al., 2012). DNA
   from soil cores was subjected to Illumina sequencing.
   Results The timing and location of post-fire Sphaerosporella ascocarp
   formation was correlated with recovery of Sphaerosporella DNA sequences
   in soils. Genetic markers (fungal barcode) of Sphaerosporella were also
   recovered from mycorrhizal root tips and endophyte cultures from
   seedlings of Pinus pungens.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates that Sphaerosporella species, in the
   absence of fire, are biotrophic, forming both mycorrhizal and endophytic
   associations with developing Pinus pungens seedlings and may persist in
   nature in the absence of wildfire as a conifer symbiont. We speculate
   that Sphaerosporella may fruit only after the host plant is damaged or
   destroyed and that after wildfires, deep roots, needle endophytes, or
   heat-resistant spores could serve as a source of soil mycelium.}},

Abstract = {{Slash-and-burn agriculture is an important driver of deforestation and
   ecosystem degradation, with large effects on biodiversity and carbon
   sequestration. This study was conducted in a forest in Madagascar, which
   consists of fragments of slash-and-burn patches, within a matrix of
   secondary and primary forest. By recording species richness, abundance,
   and composition of trees, shrubs, and herbs in fallows of various age
   and slash-and-burn history, and in the secondary and primary forest, we
   show how slash-and-burn intensity (number of cycles, duration of
   abandonment), years since last abandonment, and environmental factors
   (distance to primary forest and topography) affect the natural
   succession and recovery of the forest ecosystem. We used ordination
   analyses to examine how the species composition varied between the
   different successions stages, and to examine tree recruitment. Our
   results show shrub dominance the first years after abandonment.
   Thereafter, a subsequent increase in species richness and abundance of
   tree seedlings and saplings suggests a succession towards the diversity
   and composition of the secondary and primary forest, although a big gap
   between the oldest fallows and the secondary forest shows that this will
   take much more than 30 years. A high number and frequency of
   slash-and-burn cycles decreased tree seedling and sapling richness and
   abundance, suggesting that reducing slash-and-burn intensity will
   increase the speed of tree recruitment and fallow recovery. Trees can be
   planted into fallows to speed up vegetation and soil recovery, such that
   fallows can be usable within needed time and thus the extension of
   cultivated areas reduced. We recommend further testing of six potential
   species for restoration based on their early colonization of the fallows
   and their survival through vegetation succession.}},

Abstract = {{An uncertainty in ecological restoration is how natural disturbances

   unplanned nature of natural disturbances makes them difficult to study,
   and their effects hinge on the resistance or resilience of ecosystem
   components that may change during restoration. In 2010, a tornado struck
   a 23-year-old oak woodland-savanna restoration site in northwestern
   Ohio, USA, providing a rare opportunity to determine how a major natural
   disturbance could influence the course of restoration. Restoration
   burning had begun at the site in 1988. We monitored tree and understory
   metrics before restoration, in 10 of the 22 years during restoration
   before the tornado, and in two of five years after the tornado until
   2015. Trajectories in floristic quality and conservation-priority plant
   species (e.g., state-listed rare species) were resistant to change by
   the tornado, non-native plants were resilient (which was desirable as
   they quickly declined to near pre-tornado levels after an initial
   increase), and the oak overstory was neither resistant nor resilient.
   Overstory density was halved after the tornado, moved from woodland
   toward savanna, and then changed little. Forbs and oaks in the
   understory were the main increasers after the tornado. The tornado
   disturbance altered the pathway of restoration but remained consistent
   with restoration goals, given that both woodlands and savannas were part
   of reference conditions and conservation-priority forbs increased.}},

Abstract = {{Sizable areas of oak savanna were present in southern Ontario when the
   region was first settled by Europeans. The objective of this study was
   to reconstruct the vegetation history of oak savanna at a site in
   Ontario and to test the hypothesis that the savanna was created by
   Indian burning. The fossil pollen, plant macrofossil, and fossil
   charcoal records of the sediments of a small lake were used to
   reconstruct postglacial vegetation development in an area formerly
   occupied by oak savanna. The fossil record from the site extends from
   approximately 11 800 BP to the present. The initial vegetation around
   the lake was an open Picea woodland similar to that reported from other
   late glacial sites in southern Ontario. Pinus banksiana forest dominated
   the vegetation of the site between about 10 000 and 9000 BP. Pinus
   strobus replaced Pinus banksiana and remained the dominant tree species
   in the area until approximately 6000 BP. The persistence of Pinus
   strobus as the dominant tree species until 6000 BP is unique in southern
   Ontario. Between 6000 and 4000 BP the Pinus strobus forest was replaced
   by oak savanna. Oak savanna occupied the area until land clearance by
   Europeans at approximately A.D. 1850. The early date at which oak
   savanna developed makes it unlikely that Indian burning was the cause of
   savanna formation. Determining the cause of the late persistence of
   Pinus strobus-dominated vegetation and its replacement by oak savanna is
   difficult. It is possible that the late persistence of Pinus strobus in
   the study area is related to dry climatic conditions during the
   mid-Holocene (approximately 8000 to 6000 BP). The establishment of oak
   savanna may have been caused by the transition to moister climatic
   conditions in the later half of the Holocene. The particularly dry and
   well-drained substrates associated with oak savanna may have restricted
   occupation of these regions by more mesic tree species and maintained
   herb and graminoid dominated openings by promoting natural fires.}},

Abstract = {{Woodfuels currently supply 7 percent of worldwide energy use and are
   much more important in developing than developed countries. Worldwide
   fuelwood use may be slowly declining, while charcoal production is
   increasing. In developing countries, wood-fuel comes from natural
   forests, woodlands, shrublands, plantations and trees outside forests;
   the last is often the most important source. In developed countries,
   woodfuels are largely from industrial roundwood processing where up to
   50 percent of logs may be used for energy. In urban areas, of both
   developing and developed countries, woodfuels also arises from wood
   processing and construction and other urban residues including tree
   trimming. Currently, apart from some nonindustrial plantations and the
   small areas of energy plantations, woodfuel largely results from
   by-products and residues.
   Forest plantation may currently provide 15 to 20 percent of all fuelwood
   and this contribution will rise due to continued tree planting plus the
   rapidly increasing industrial plantation harvest. However, forest and
   woodfuel-use data are of uneven quality, making estimates tenuous.
   There is potential to increase the amount of woodfuels in developed
   countries but its use will depend on fossil fuel price increases, and on
   ecological and social issues. In Nordic countries, forest residue use
   has grown, being underpinned by carbon taxes and research and
   development. Site nutrient conservation is assisted by leaving foliage
   on site and by returning the ash after burning. Leaving bark on site may
   be important for eucalypts.
   In developing countries participatory programmes are critical for
   encouraging tree planting. Farmers seldom plant for fuelwood alone.
   Large-scale fuelwood plantations programs have not always been
   successful. Agroforestry practices are often practiced as they provide
   multiple benefits, including the provision of woodfuel. Silviculture
   should be readily adoptable, with special attention being given to
   species selection, high-quality planting stock, establishment methods
   and protection from animals.
   Because of woodfuel's low relative value, energy is seldom a management
   objective of industrial plantations. However, often silviculture could
   be altered to increase bioenergy output, particularly with those sawlog
   regimes based on low stockings and non-extraction thinnings, and through
   more intensive silviculture. As a supplement to current silvicultural
   decision-making tools, energy analysis of silvicultural options would
   assist in efficient allocation of fossil fuels.}},

   and environmental factors of different areas, which had been mapped as
   slash-and-burn land and forests during the 19th century. The results
   demonstrated that the differences in ground vegetation between
   slash-and-burn sites and continuous forests are small and up to 5.2\% of
   vegetation variability can be explained by different land use during the
   19th century. There were no differences in soil characteristics among
   sites. The differences in vegetation could be connected to 20th century
   developments as sections of former slash-and-burn sites were utilised as
   open fields during the opening decades of the 20th century. In terms of

Abstract = {{Eucalypts, especially blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), have been
   extensively planted in Portugal and nowadays dominate most of its forest
   landscapes. Large-scale forestation programs can intensify fire
   activity, and blue gum plantations are often viewed as highly flammable
   due to the nature and structure of the fuel complex. The role of
   eucalypt plantations in the fire regime of Mediterranean climate regions
   is increasingly debated following the recent catastrophic wildfires in
   Portugal and elsewhere. In this study we examined the effects of
   eucalypt forestation on burned area (BA), fire size, and fire severity
   in Portugal. This was based on fire and vegetation mapping and
   statistics, fire weather data, satellite imagery, and national forest
   inventory data. Eucalypt BA comprised an average of 12.5\% of total BA
   (1980-2017) and did not increase over time and with eucalypt expansion.
   Eucalypt metrics did not explain interannual BA variability after
   accounting for the effects of other variables. Forest fires started
   within eucalypt stands were the least likely to become large, and large
   fire size was irresponsive to forest composition. Likewise, forest type
   was a generally minor influence in mega-fire severity and accounted for
   just 1.4-8.6\% of surface fuel-hazard metrics variation. In general,
   large-scale conversion of maritime pine to eucalypt stands (1970-2015)
   implied lower fuel accumulation. Fire activity results are consistent
   with fuel hazard results and express trade-offs between short-rotation
   forestry and fire behaviour in blue gum stands, with high spotting
   potential versus modest crown fire likelihood. We found no support for
   the contention of a modified fire regime as a result of eucalypt
   forestation in Portugal, but the rising undermanaged and abandoned blue
   gum estate, especially after large-fire seasons, is a concern for the
   future. However, it remains to be determined whether post-fire eucalypt
   regrowth is a higher fire threat than native vegetation in the same
   context. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fire dependent pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) and scrub oak (Quercus
   ilicifolia Wang.) barrens are found on coarse-textured, droughty soils
   in the northeastern United States. These communities are globablly rare
   and, in many areas, dependent on active management to sustain them. We
   used historic and recent aerial photographs of the Central Pine Barrens
   in New York to develop transition matrices and trajectories of
   vegetation change. A vegetation map for 1990 provided pre-burn cover
   type information for a 1,200 ha area burned by an extremely severe
   wildfire in August 1995. Geographic information system analyses, a
   fire-history study, post-wildfire research and existing literature
   provided additional information for development of three conceptual
   models that describe our understanding of vegetation change in response
   to fire and land clearing. A simulation model was then used to predict
   the amount of each cover type in 2046. The reasonableness of the
   prediction was assessed based on our understanding of pine barrens
   vegetation dynamics.
   In 1938, following a period of frequent, intense wildfires of the
   region, 90\% of vegetation in the study area was open canopy barrens
   (including dwarf pine plains, pitch pine-scrub oak woodland, heath,
   pine-heath woodland, and scrub oak shrubland). Between 1938 and 1994,
   wildfires decreased in size, the average area burned per year generally
   declined, and there were no fires in 70\% of the study area. As a
   result, barrens decreased to similar to45\% of study area vegetation. In
   August 1995, an unusually severe summer wildfire converted 8 10 ha of
   woodland and forest into scrub oak shrubland, and increased barrens to
   60\% of study area vegetation. Most areas of heath and pine-heath, which
   comprised 24\% of barrens vegetation in 1996, are successional types
   that developed on formerly cleared land. In the absence of extensive
   burning, we expect barrens vegetation to be converted to closed-canopy
   forest as coppice trees and new seedlings mature. Recent changes in fire
   regimes are likely to result in a loss of barrens vegetation that
   exceeds predictions of the simulation model. Careful use of prescribed
   fire and/or mechanical treatments to simulate the effects of fire are
   recommended for future restoration and maintenance of pitch pine
   barrens, and for protection of human life and property. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Over the past three decades, wildfires in southwestern US ponderosa pine
   (Anus ponderosa Lawson \& C. Lawson) forests have increased in size and
   severity. These wildfires can remove large, contiguous patches of mature
   forests, alter dominant plant communities and increase woody debris,
   potentially altering fungal community composition. Additionally,
   post-fire conditions may shift dominant fungal functional groups from
   plant-symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi to more decomposer
   saprotrophic fungi. We investigated the long-term (13 years
   post-wildfire) effect of fire severity on 1) fungal sporocarp density,
   functional groups and community composition and 2) EM colonization and
   community composition from naturally regenerating ponderosa pine
   seedlings on the Pumpkin Fire that burned in 2000 in Arizona, USA. Plots
   were located in four burn severity classes: unburned, moderate-severity,
   and two high-severity (defined as 100\% tree mortality) classes, either
   adjacent to residual live forest edges (edge plots), or >200 m from any
   residual live trees (interior plots). We found that high-severity burn
   plots had a unique sporocarp community composition, and a shift in
   dominant sporocarp functional groups, with 5-13 times lower EM sporocarp
   densities, and 4-7 times lower EM sporocarp species richness compared to
   unburned and moderate-severity plots. In contrast, saprotrophic
   sporocarp densities and richness were similar among burn severity
   classes, even with the large amount of coarse wood in the high-severity
   burn patches. Regenerating ponderosa pine seedlings had similar EM
   colonization and richness among severity classes, yet high-severity
   interior plots had a different community composition and a lower
   relative abundance of EM species compared to moderate-severity burn
   plots. Taken together, our results suggest that large patches of
   high-severity fire have long-term consequences for both EM sporocarp and
   root tip communities. Because EM fungal species vary in function, the
   limited species pool available in interior high-severity burn patches
   may influence pine recovery.}},

Abstract = {{A thorough understanding of the role of microbes in C cycling in
   relation to fire is important for estimation of C emissions and for
   development of guidelines for sustainable management of dry ecosystems.
   We investigated the seasonal changes and spatial distribution of soil
   total. dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C during 18
   months, quantified the soil CO2 emission in the beginning of the rainy
   season. and related these variables to the fire frequency in important
   dry vegetation types grassland, woodland and dry forest in Ethiopia. The
   soil C isotope ratios (delta C-13) reflected the 15-fold decrease in the
   grass biomass along the vegetation gradient and the 12-fold increase in
   woody biomass in the opposite direction. Changes in delta C-13 down the
   soil profiles also suggested that in two of the grass-dominated sites
   woody plants were more frequent in the past. The soil C stock ranged
   from being 2.5 (dry forest) to 48 times (grassland) higher than the C
   stock in the aboveground plant biomass. The influence of fire in
   frequently burnt wooded grassland was evident as an unchanged or
   increasing total C content down the soil profile. DOC and microbial
   biomass measured with the fumigation-extraction method (C-mic) reflected
   the vertical distribution of soil organic matter (SOM). However,
   although SOM was stable throughout the year, seasonal fluctuations in
   C-mic and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) were large. In woodland
   and woodland-wooded grassland C-mic and SIR increased in the dry season,
   and gradually decreased during the following rainy season, confirming
   previous suggestions that microbes may play an important role in
   nutrient retention in the dry season. However, in dry forest and two
   wooded grasslands C-mic and SIR was stable throughout the rainy season,
   or even increased in this period, which could lead to enhanced
   competition with plants for nutrients. Both the ran-e and the seasonal
   changes in soil microbial biomass C in dry tropical ecosystems may be
   wider than previously assumed. Neither SIR nor C-mic were good
   predictors of in situ soil respiration. The soil respiration was
   relatively high in infrequently burnt forest and woodland, while
   frequently burnt grasslands had lower rates, presumably because most C
   is released through dry season burning and not through decomposition in
   fire-prone systems. Shifts in the relative importance of the two
   pathways for C release from organic matter may have strong implications
   for C and nutrient cycling in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems. (C)

Volume = {{400}},

Abstract = {{Fuel moisture is a key driver of forest flammability as it influences
   ignition likelihood, fire intensity and resultant fire severity. Changes
   to forest canopy cover following disturbances like wildfire or logging
   may alter forest flammability by changing the microclimatic conditions
   that influence fine fuel moisture. Wet forests dominated by Mountain Ash
   (Eucalyptus regnans) are highly valued for their flora and fauna,
   timber, carbon and water. Wildfires are an important part of the
   lifecycle of these forests, but too frequent fire can threaten post-fire
   regeneration. With large tracts of Mountain Ash forest recovering from
   recent wildfires (in 2009 and 1983) there is a need to understand the
   mechanisms driving flammability in these forests, particularly as the
   forest structure changes following fire. This study sought to understand
   the effects of fire history on the flammability of Mountain Ash forests
   by specifically considering fuel moisture for different times since fire
   and fire severities. We measured canopy cover (plant area index) and
   fuel moisture within 8 forest sites last burnt between 7 and 200 years
   ago by wildfires of low or high severity. Fuel moisture and fuel
   availability (i.e. number of days when fine fuels are dry enough to
   ignite and sustain spreading fire) were strongly associated with canopy
   cover; with denser canopied forests having higher fuel moisture. The
   largest differences in canopy cover occurred between the recently burnt
   high and low severity forests. For the longer-unburnt forests there were
   no systematic differences evident in canopy cover with time since fire
   or fire severity. The fuel moisture was higher and fuels only available
   to burn on one day in the forest recently burnt by high severity fire
   (in association with a dense canopy). In contrast, fuels were drier and
   available to burn on 238 days in the forest recently burnt by low
   severity fire (in association with a sparser canopy). For the
   longer-unburnt forests (33 or more years since fire) there were no clear
   trends between fuel moisture and time since fire and fire severity
   suggesting that fires do not have a lasting impact on fuel moisture
   within these wet forests. Overall, this study shows that wildfires have
   immediate impacts on fuel moisture in Mountain Ash forests but as the
   time since fire increases, moisture appears to be more a function of
   canopy properties than fire history. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at describing post-fire mushroom production in a
   Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. in the
   northwest of Spain and assessing the results by classificatory models.
   During the autumn periods of 2003-2006, fruit bodies from 115 fungal
   taxa were collected in burned and unburned areas and were further
   grouped into the following categories: saprotrophic/mycorrhizal; and
   edible/non-edible. After wildfires, a significant reduction in the
   number of fungal species and fruit body biomass production was observed.
   Based on this relevant information, the first simple classificatory
   model for this aim is provided. Nine alternative models based on
   classifications according to combinations of edibility and functional
   groups were fitted, and four fruiting body biomass production classes
   were defined as possible responses. As explanatory factors, time after
   fire and climatic variables significantly related to fruit body
   production were included. The best predictive results were obtained for
   edible and edible-mycorrhizal models, for which the correct
   classification rate of production classes was between 92 and 85 \%.
   Moreover, the models obtained were applied to analyse the effect of time
   after fire on fungal production. Mycorrhizal and edible fungal
   production after fire was classified into the lowest class, whereas
   saprotrophic and non-edible species followed a contrary trend. The
   classificatory models can be useful to optimise management and harvest

Abstract = {{The extremely invasive Old World Climbing Fern, Lygodium microphyllum,
   has invaded New World tropical and subtropical habitats. Lygodium
   microphyllum has indeterminate twining leaves that grow up on and shade
   out host shrubs and trees. their epiphytes, and the understory. This
   invasive plant threatens numerous native habitats in Florida USA and the
   Caribbean, including internationally valued conservation lands such as
   Everglades National Park. Fire, which can reduce or stimulate growth
   and/or reproduction in different plant species, is one intervention used
   to manage L. microphyllum, but the effects of burning on this species'
   growth are unknown. We experimentally burned greenhouse-grown plants.
   then monitored their growth in response to burning for 18 months. We
   also clipped a subset of the greenhouse plants to determine whether fire
   effects were explained by aboveground biomass removal. In our
   experiment, fire either killed or reduced the regrowth of L.
   microphyllum plants. Burning killed 25\% of the burned plants and slowed
   growth of the remaining burned plants for up to 18 months post-bun'.
   Size had a significant effect on plant mortality: smaller burned plants
   had greater mortality than larger plants. Mechanically removing the
   aboveground biomass (leaves) by clipping did not kill any plants but
   reduced their growth as compared to controls in the first six months
   after treatment. Clipped plants, however, had substantially recovered
   after 12 months. Burned plants were more sensitive to drought than
   clipped or control plants. The results show that burning does more than
   remove biomass, compromising the root system and perhaps damaging the
   hydraulic support system. similar to the latent mortality effects of
   fire on forest trees. We discuss how fire could affect invasion by this
   species, incorporating fire effects on spore viability and dispersal, as
   well as on subsequent plant regrowth. These results show that fire is a
   useful management tool for L. microphyllum invasions that both kills
   plants and reduces plant regrowth for up to 18 months.}},

Abstract = {{The post-fire soil faunal communities are formed both by animals having
   survived the fire and by colonizers from the surrounding landscape. The
   relative impact of these processes is largely affected by fire
   intensity. However, with the same fire intensity, the severity of the
   fire and, thus, the survival of soil animals could vary depending on
   environmental heterogeneity. We hypothesized that much fewer soil
   animals would survive the same fire intensity on shallow, dry soils than
   on deep, moist soils. To clarify the impact of soil depth and moisture
   on animal survival after fire, we conducted a burning experiment in the
   laboratory. Soil samples containing indigenous populations of soil fauna
   were taken along two transects from the top, slope and foot of two
   respective rocky outcrops within a mixed coniferous forest in Central
   Sweden. Half of the samples were burnt and half were left unburnt.
   Burning depth varied between 24 mm (soils from the top of the gradient)
   to 12 mm (slope and foot soils) indicating a difference in flammability.
   The proportion of animals surviving fire seemed to be fairly independent
   of burning depth (42 to 62\% survival rate). Contribution of eggs which
   survived fire in the soil to the overall animal abundance restoration
   was negligible (1-3\%).
   A multi-trophic approach resulted in different sensitivity estimates to
   artificial burning of various parameters. Abundance and biomass of all
   fauna groups studied was more sensitive to fire than species richness.
   Collembolans and macrofauna predators were the groups most tolerant to
   fire, while oribatid mites and macrofaunal detritivores showed higher
   mortality after the fire treatment. Despite a more pronounced alteration
   of the components of soil food-web by burning in the lowland Sphagnum
   plots, they may be important as refugia, especially for more slowly
   moving soil-dwelling macro- and microarthropods. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Post-fire land degradation is to a large degree determined by what
   happens to soil properties and ground cover during and after the fire.
   To study fire impact in relation to fire intensity and post-fire soil
   exposure, a 9-ha Portuguese shrubland catchment was burned by
   experimental fire in the 2008/9 winter season. Previous studies reported
   on the significant increase in erosion after this fire, and discussed
   the role of reduced canopy interception and changed soil water
   repellency dynamics. Our objective was to assess whether fire-induced
   changes in soil physical properties and soil surface characteristics may
   have played an additional role in the increase in runoff and erosion
   observed after the fire. We sampled these properties before, immediately
   after, and up to one year after fire, and monitored soil temperatures
   during the fire using thermocouples. Despite the locally high fire
   intensity (>15.000 kW m(-1) in some places), soil physical changes were
   not observed: topsoil bulk density, organic matter, porosity and
   saturated conductivity did not significantly change, likely because soil
   temperatures stayed low with the 05 cm depth not exceeding 32.5 degrees
   C. Soil surface characteristics did change: Manning's n and random
   roughness both decreased, increasing the risk and erosivity of overland
   flow. Results indicate that soil physical changes unlikely contributed
   to the increase in post-fire erosion observed in the catchment and that
   a high-intensity winter burn does not necessarily lead to severe soil
   changes. Nevertheless, soil surface changes during and after fire
   contribute to an increase runoff and erosion risk in these areas. (C)

   survival increased (46\%). By comparison, in extreme fire-weather
   conditions, lower fire intensity at higher levels of Callitris
   abundance, was not sufficient to increase Callitris survival (4\%).
   Callitris survival was also positively related to trunk diameter. Ground
   fuel type, but not biomass, varied with vegetation composition.
   Conclusions
   These results demonstrate that flammable feedbacks, mediated by low
   flammability fuel traits of dominant trees, can provide an important
   mechanism for enhancing the survival and persistence of slow-growing,
   non-serotinous, non-resprouting, fire-killed trees in highly flammable
   landscapes. By modifying vegetation and fuel structure, patches of
   fire-sensitive Callitris reduce fire intensity, and thereby reduce
   Callitris mortality, enhancing population persistence. However, this
   feedback loop is insufficient to ensure Callitris survival under extreme
   fire-weather conditions, when fire intensity is greater. After burning,
   stands remain vulnerable to future fires, until trees grow large enough
   to modify fuel levels and reduce stand flammability.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate which qualities of dead wood have the highest conservational
   value for invertebrates, substrate requirements were recorded for all
   542 saproxylic (wood-living) red-listed invertebrates in Sweden.
   Preferred qualities of dead trees were described for each species in
   seven category variables: tree species, stage of decay, type of main
   stem, coarseness of stem, part of tree, light preference and
   microhabitat. For each duality we quantified the number of red-listed
   insect species using it and the number that are specific to the quality.
   The number of species associated with different tree genera ranged from
   five to 202. Species-rich genera had a higher proportion of monophagous
   species. To what extent different tree genera have faunas complementary
   to each other was also analysed. As the wood decays, the host range
   broadens and the flora of decay fungi will probably take over as the
   most important factor determining the saproxylic fauna. Because there
   are many different types of rot required by different invertebrates, an
   abundance of similar looking dead trees, logs and snags are probably
   needed. Some 59\% of the invertebrate species can live in sun-exposed
   sites. Most of these are favoured when the forest burns and at least 29
   of them are more strongly associated with fires. For the former
   category, leaving dead wood on clear cuts should be an effective way to
   increase the amount of breeding substrate. However, some species,
   especially those living in the last successional stages, are dependent
   on shaded sites. Hollow tree trunks are another important microhabitat;
   64 of the 107 species living there are specialists. To maintain all
   saproxylic species we need a diversity of substrate types and management
   methods. Our data can help to decide how to optimize the conservation
   measures taken during forest operations.}},

Abstract = {{Neolithic agriculture in Central Europe and farming with domestic
   animals demanded - for first time - that local forest clearance, by
   means of felling and burning, took place in order to create cattle yards
   and fields for the cultivation of cereals. The natural variety of the
   prehistoric occupation areas in the neolithic - early bandceramian
   period as well as the local conditions of the settlements and their
   economic base with husbandry and cultivation of wild growing plants, of
   cereals, and other weeds are most distinctly reflected in the
   palaeo-environment and can be detected by palaeo-ethnobotanical
   research.
   This contribution describes the ecological interpretation of
   archaeobotanical data, the ecological changes during the transformation
   of natural woodlands into the cultural landscape with its specific
   variety of anthropogenic biotopes. In general the wild growing plants,
   the cultivated plants and the synanthropic species of weeds and ruderals
   and several forms of anthropogenic influences can be used as a key to
   palaeoecology and the ecological changes that took place in the cultural
   landscape. Due to extensive cultivation the number of anthropogenic
   biotopes and of semi-natural plant associations, whose existence
   depended on specific anthropo-zoogenic factors, rose and the diversity
   of the flora and vegetation increased.
   The studies of vegetation history and integration of the activities of
   ancient man with this specific land-use on extensive base provide a
   recent and ancient picture of the old-fashioned  cultural landscape.
   Many plant associations today are endangered by the increasing processes
   of intensive land-use with landscape-levelling, drastic species
   extinction and partially by recordable effects of pollutants and
   nutrients on the environment.}},

   heterogeneity in a wide variety of habitats, but denned exclusively in

   soil was quantified by physical separation and a peroxide-acid digestion

   increase by a factor of ten to >200 kg C ha(-1). The thinned wildfire
   treatment produced less charcoal C than unthinned wildfire and thinned
   prescribed fire treatments. The charcoal formation rate was 1 to 8\% of
   woody fuels consumed, and this percentage was negatively related to
   woody fuels consumed, resulting in less charcoal formation with greater
   fire severity. Charcoal C averaged 2000 kg ha(-1) in 0-3 cm mineral soil
   and may have decreased as a result of fire, coincident with convective
   or erosive loss of mineral soil. Charcoal C in 3-15 cm mineral soil was
   stable at 5500 kg C ha(-1). Long-term soil C sequestration in the

Abstract = {{Understanding effects of changes in ecological disturbance regimes on
   soil properties, and capacity of soil properties to resist disturbance,
   is important for assessing ecological condition. In this meta-analysis,
   we examined the resilience of surface soil properties and their spatial
   patterning to disturbance by fire in sagebrush steppe of North America -
   a biome currently experiencing increases in wildfire due to climate
   change. We reviewed 39 studies that reported on soil properties for
   sagebrush steppe with distinct microsite (undershrub and interspace)
   patterning that was or was not recently burned. We estimated microsite
   effects for 21 soil properties and examined the effect of burning on
   microsite effects during the first year post-fire, before the
   re-establishment of vegetation. Results indicated that the spatial
   patterning of biogeochemical resources, in which soil surfaces beneath
   shrubs are enriched, is resilient to burning. However, microsite effects
   for soil-surface hydrologic, temperature and erosion characteristics
   appeared to shift following burning. These shifts appear to create a
   negative feedback for the spatial patterning of soil properties before
   vegetation recovery. Relatively long (decades-centuries) historic fire
   intervals in sagebrush steppe ecosystems likely reinforce spatial

Abstract = {{Climatic warming will increase river temperature globally, with
   consequences for cold water-adapted organisms. In regions with low
   forest cover, elevated river temperature is often associated with a lack
   of bankside shading. Consequently, river managers have advocated
   riparian tree planting as a strategy to reduce temperature extremes.
   However, the effect of riparian shading on river temperature varies
   substantially between locations. Process-based models can elucidate the
   relative importance of woodland and other factors driving river
   temperature and thus improve understanding of spatial variability of the
   effect of shading, but characterising the spatial distribution and
   height of riparian tree cover necessary to parameterise these models
   remains a significant challenge. Here, we document a novel approach that
   combines Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry acquired from a
   drone to characterise the riparian canopy with a process based
   temperature model (Heat Source) to simulate the effects of tree shading
   on river temperature. Our approach was applied in the Gimock Burn, a
   tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland. Results show that SIM
   approximates true canopy elevation with a good degree of accuracy (R-2 =
   0.96) and reveals notable spatial heterogeneity in shading. When these
   data were incorporated into a process-based temperature model, it was
   possible to simulate river temperatures with a similarly-high level of
   accuracy (RMSE <0.7 degrees C) to a model parameterised using
   `conventional' LiDAR tree height data. We subsequently demonstrate the
   utility of our approach for quantifying the magnitude of shading effects
   on stream temperature by comparing simulated temperatures against
   another model from which all riparian woodland has been removed. Our
   findings highlight drone-based SIM as an effective tool for
   characterising riparian shading and improving river temperature models.
   This research provides valuable insights into the effects of riparian
   woodland on river temperature and the potential of bankside tree
   planting for climate change adaptation. Crown Copyright (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Post-fire salvage logging adds another set of environmental effects to
   recently burned areas, and previous studies have reported varying
   impacts on vegetation, soil disturbance, and sediment production with
   limited data on the underlying processes. Our objectives were to
   determine how: (1) ground-based post-fire logging affects surface cover,
   soil water repellency, soil compaction, and vegetative regrowth; (2)
   different types of logging disturbance affect sediment production at the
   plot and small catchment ({''}swale{''}) scales; and (3) applying
   logging slash to skid trails affects soil properties, vegetative
   regrowth, and sediment production. Four study areas were established in
   severely burned forests in the interior western USA. We installed plots
   at two study areas to compare burned but unlogged controls against skid
   trails, feller-buncher trails, and skid trails with added slash. Salvage
   logged and control swales were established at each study area, but only
   one study area had simultaneous measurements on replicated swales. Data
   were collected for 0-2 years prior to logging and from 2-8 years after
   logging.
   The skidder and feller-buncher plots generally had greater compaction,
   less soil water repellency, and slower vegetative regrowth than the
   controls. Sediment production from the skidder plots was 10-100 times
   the value from the controls. The slightly less compacted feller-buncher
   plots produced only 10 - 30\% as much sediment as the skidder plots, but
   regrowth was similarly inhibited. The relative differences in sediment
   production between the disturbed plots and the controls tended to
   increase over time as the controls exhibited more rapid regrowth. Adding
   slash to skid trails increased total ground cover by 20-30\% and reduced
   the sediment yields by 5-50 times compared to the untreated skidder
   plots.
   The replicated logged swales at one study area generally had higher
   sediment production rates than their controls but the absolute values
   per unit area were much lower than from the skidder and feller-buncher
   plots. Results from the swales at the other study areas indicated that
   logging did not increase runoff, peak flows, or sediment yields.
   Vegetative regrowth and sediment production rates varied widely among
   the four study areas. This variation was largely due to differences in
   rainfall and soil properties, with the more productive sites having more
   rapid regrowth and thereby a more rapid reduction in sediment
   production. The susceptibility to surface runoff and erosion after high
   severity fires suggests that areas disturbed by ground-based salvage
   logging need additional mitigation practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Changes in structural and compositional attributes of shinnery oak

   composition. Three study sites were located in western Oklahoma; each
   contained 12, 60 x 30-m plots that were designated, within site, to be
   seasonally burned, annually burned, or left unburned. Growing season
   canopy cover for herbaceous and woody species was estimated in 1997-1998
   (post-treatment). At one year post-fire, burning in any season reduced
   shrub cover, and spring burns reduced cover most. Winter and annual
   fires increased cover of rhizomatous tallgrasses, whereas burning in any
   season decreased little bluestem cover. Perennial forbs increased with
   fall and winter fire. Shrub stem density increased with fire in any
   season. Communities returned rapidly to pre-burn composition with
   increasing time since fire. Fire effects on herbaceous vegetation appear
   to be manifested through increases in bare ground and reduction of
   overstory shrub dominance. Prescribed fire can be used as a tool in
   restoration efforts to increase or maintain within and between community
   plant diversity. Our data suggest that some plant species may require or

Abstract = {{Fire is a common disturbance in the Mediterranean ecosystem. A fire that

   carried out a comparative study of rodent recovery after fire under
   three different management regimes in order to establish the best

   of their limited home range, to assess the best management practice to
   be used in the recovery of the post-fire habitat. Our results show that
   the three arboreal Palaeoarctic species which lived in this habitat
   before the fire either died during the fire or left the habitat as a
   result of its destruction. A succession of rodent species was observed.
   The untreated burned forest had the highest species diversity in the
   initial stage, while during a later stage the highest diversity was
   observed in plots where the burned trees were cut down, the trunks
   removed and the twigs collected into small piles. The results also
   suggest that removing the trunks and twigs at the initial stage of

Abstract = {{In the absence of a disturbance regime, flora at historical oak sand
   barrens change as leaf litter builds up and increasing canopy cover
   shades bare soils. Over time, black oak sand barrens become more mesic,
   and other trees including Acer rubrum, Fraxinus sp., Prunus serotina,
   and Sassafras albidum often mix with oaks in the canopy. Three different
   restoration techniques were applied to recreate disturbance across 10
   sites within degraded black oak (Quercus velutina) glacial kames, which
   are mounds of sand and gravel deposited by melting ice sheets: select
   canopy tree thinning favoring 5-30\% tree canopy cover, forest floor
   leaf litter removal, and prescribed fire. Ground layer richness and

   Carolina Vegetation Survey plots and compared against both temporally

   greatest vegetation response in species diversity, whether as

   group, or pooling all plants. Leaf litter removal produced a modest
   pulse response from a few select species released from the
   shade-creating effects of accumulating leaf litter. Prescribed burns did
   not create a disturbance sufficient for any significant plant response,
   presumably because low-intensity burning minimally reduced leaf litter
   cover. Thus, manipulations that opened the canopy and reduced soil
   moisture more directly induced barren-species recovery than did efforts

Abstract = {{Although indigenous to southern Africa, Pechuel-loeschea leubnitziae is
   considered a problematic weed as it forms dense monotypic stands in the
   grasslands and woodlands of the Okavango Delta, Botswana, and is
   associated with veld degradation and a dominance of shade-tolerant,
   poor-quality grass species. Generalised linear modelling was used to
   determine the effect of the following environmental conditions on the
   likelihood of occurrence of P. leubnitziae: type of land use, vegetation
   type, burning history, total woody species density, soil pH and soil
   texture. There was no difference in P. leubnitziae presence under
   wildlife, large livestock and small livestock land use (p = 0.227). Only
   vegetation type (p < 0.001) and total woody species density (p < 0.001)
   significantly affected P. leubnitziae occurrence, with the species being
   rare in dense mopane woodlands and most likely to occur in mixed
   thornveld and mixed broadleaf woodland, although this likelihood
   decreased with increasing total woody species density. A single burn had
   no effect on P. leubnitziae occurrence, but repeated burning should be
   investigated as a means to reduce the vigour and recoppicing success of
   P. leubnitziae.}},

Abstract = {{Thinning and prescribed burning are common management practices for
   reducing fuel buildup in ponderosa pine forests. However, it is not well
   understood if their combined use is required to lower wildfire risk and

   combinations of thinning, prescribed fire, and slash retention for two
   decades across a site quality gradient of second-growth pine stands,
   measuring changes in forest vegetation growth, structure, and
   composition. Thinning alone doubled the diameter growth increment of
   ponderosa pine, moderately stimulated shrub production, and resulted in
   lower tree mortality compared with unthinned plots. In contrast,
   repeated fire alone did not substantially alter stand structure or
   increase tree vigor, herbaceous production, or plant diversity. The
   combined use of thinning and repeated burning reduced shrub cover, yet
   produced no changes in herbaceous production, plant diversity, stand
   structure, or tree vigor compared with thin-only treatments. Additional
   findings identified (1) inconsequential effects of thinning residues on
   site productivity, (2) the need for multiple entries of prescribed fire
   if the abatement of shrubs is required, (3) the ineffectiveness of
   repeated burning to stimulate plant growth, and (4) that the thinning

Abstract = {{The composition of mammalian communities in Australia's Eucalyptus
   forests and woodlands is known to be affected by fire. However, there
   are few published studies that compare mammal assemblages in recently
   burnt and long-unburnt forests because there are few areas with
   long-term fire history data. Understanding the value of long-unburnt
   forest is important because it is becoming rare in fire-prone regions of
   the world, such as south-eastern Australia, partly because of the
   widespread use of prescribed burning. We deployed wildlife cameras for
   28 trap-nights at each of 81 sites that ranged from 0.5 to at least 96
   years since the last fire. We recorded a total of 15 native mammal
   species. At least one mammal species was recorded at 80 of the 81 sites.
   Significantly more species were detected at long-unburnt sites (>96
   years since fire) than sites 0.5-12 years since the last fire. Species
   composition varied significantly between sites 0.5-12 years and >96
   years since the last fire but did not vary between sites 0.5-2 years and
   6-12 years since the last fire. Although there was not one category of
   time since fire (i.e. 0.5-2 years, 6-12 years and >96 years) in which
   all 15 native mammal species were recorded, long-unburnt sites were
   significantly more important for the occurrence of seven mammal species;
   intermediate and recently burnt sites were significantly more important
   for one species. Our results suggested that, while a diversity of fire
   ages is important for conserving mammalian diversity, long-unburnt
   forests and woodlands (which comprised only 8\% of our study area) are
   disproportionately important for mammal conservation. Our results add to
   a growing body of the literature from south-eastern Australia,
   suggesting that remaining long-unburnt forest should be afforded
   protection from fire and more forest should be transitioned to long
   unburnt.}},

Abstract = {{Paraserianthes lophantha (Willd.) I. C. Nielsen is a plant species
   native to SW Australia that has recently invaded temperate ecosystems in
   Europe and other areas in the world. Since it has been found in burnt
   areas and its expansion could be promoted by forest fires, the
   germination response of seeds to fire factors (heat, smoke, ash and
   charcoal) was analyzed. Furthermore, stochastic post-fire invasion
   models were developed to check the impact of one-off and repeated forest
   fires. The spreading pattern after fire was modeled to provide accurate
   forecasts for future fires. The model was parameterized using data
   recorded after the 2013 forest fire in the Natura 2000 site Monte Pindo.
   Germination response is mainly modified by heat, which breaks seed
   dormancy at moderate temperature and kills seeds at high temperatures.
   Smoke, ash and charcoal did not have relevant influence on seed
   germination except large amounts of ash, which prevented seed
   germination. Neither charcoal origin (from native or from exotic
   species) had a significant effect on P. lophantha germination. The
   invasion model demonstrated the significant role of forest fires
   promoting P. lophantha spreading. Recurrent fires promote the spreading
   of invasive species, threatening natural plant communities. However, the
   expansion of the species was not exclusively linked to forest fires:
   anthropic systems, edges of agricultural areas and old fields were
   particularly affected by P. lophantha expansion. Some control methods
   based on the reproductive behavior and spreading pattern of P. lophantha
   were proposed in order to prevent new invasions and manage invaded

   and multiple regression analysis was used to examine the influence of
   individual storm characteristics and system moisture on overland flow

   in the unburned watershed is best explained by storm size, while
   overland flow in the burned watershed was positively related to storm
   size and time between storms. These findings suggest that the burned
   system had decreased infiltration rates and increased soil water
   repellency. In contrast, there is a statistically significant negative
   relationship between overland flow 1 year after a fire against different

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Climate change affects all ecosystems but despite increasing recognition
   for the needs to integrate Indigenous knowledge with modern climate
   science, the epistemological differences between the two make it
   challenging. In this study, we present how Indigenous belief and
   knowledge system can frame the application of a modeling tool
   (Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator). We focus on managing forest
   ecosystem services of the Dine (Navajo) Nation as a case study. Most
   Dine tribal members depend directly on the land for their livelihoods
   and cultural traditions. The forest plays a vital role in Dine
   livelihoods through social, cultural, spiritual, subsistence, and
   economic factors. We simulated forest dynamics over time under
   alternative climate change scenarios and management strategies to
   identify forest management strategies that will maintain future
   ecosystem services. We initialized the Climate-Forest Vegetation
   Simulator model with data from permanent plots and site-specific growth
   models under multiple management systems (no-management, thinning,
   burning, and assisted migration planting) and different climate
   scenarios (no-climate-change, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0). Projections of climate
   change show average losses of basal area by over 65\% by 2105, a shift
   in tree species composition to drier-adapted species, and a decrease in
   species diversity. While substantial forest loss was inevitable under
   the warming climate scenarios, the modeling framework allowed us to
   evaluate the management treatments, including planting, for conserving
   multiple tree species in mixed conifer forests, thus providing an anchor
   for biodiversity. We presented the modeling results and management
   implications and discuss how they can complement Dine kinship concepts.
   Our approach is a useful step for framing modern science with Indigenous

Abstract = {{Various problems such as massive volume loss, erosion, degradation of

   Thus, necessary forest operations should be quickly planned and

   place immediately to maintain forest vegetation in burned areas. The aim
   of this study was developing a Post-fire Action Planning (PFAP) model to
   minimize the time spent on salvage logging activities. PFAP model will
   assist decision makers for removing salvage timber in a timely manner
   after large scale forest fires, while considering economic and
   environmental constraints, and dealing with available employment
   conditions in local forest industry. The capabilities of this model were
   examined by standardizing the operational planning and developing a fast
   decision-making process. The model was implemented in Tasagil Forest
   Enterprise Chiefs (FEC) of Antalya Forest Regional Directorate where the
   forests are sensitivity to fire at the first degree level and the second
   largest forest fire in the history of Turkish Forestry occurred in this
   area in 2008. The findings of PFAP model were compared with the data of
   actual salvage logging operation obtained from the FEC. The results
   indicated that using operational planning based PFAP model is capable of
   reducing total time spent on salvage logging operation by about 60\%.
   Based on the forestry compartments of the study area, estimated
   durations of salvage logging operations were 15 to 75 days less than
   that of actual operations taken place in the field. Therefore, it is
   highly anticipated that using operational planning based PFAP model has
   great potential to provide economically and environmentally sound forest
   operations after forest fires.}},

Abstract = {{Short- and long-term impacts of wildland fires on forest floor
   properties and erosion potential were examined at three locations in the

   investigated within six months of burning on the George
   Washington-Jefferson National Forest (GWJNF) in Bland County, Virginia
   and the Monongahela National Forest (MNF) in Grant County, West
   Virginia. An additional wildfire was studied eight years post-fire on
   the Fishburn Forest (FF) in Montgomery County, Virginia. A 2018
   prescribed fire was also studied within six months of burning on the MNF
   in Pendleton County, West Virginia. Litter and duff consumption were
   examined to evaluate fire severity and char heights were measured to
   better understand fire intensity. The Universal Soil Loss Equation for
   forestlands (USLE-Forest) was utilized to estimate potential erosion
   values. For the 2018 comparisons, litter depth was least as a result of
   the wildfires on both the MNF and GWJNF (p < 0.001). Wildfire burned
   duff depths in 2018 did not differ from unburned duff depths on either
   the MNF or GWJNF. Eight years after the FF wildfire, post-fire litter
   depth was less than that of an adjacent non-burned forest (p = 0.29) and
   duff depth was greater than that of an adjacent non-burned forest (p =
   0.76). Mean GWJNF wildfire char heights were greatest of all disturbance
   regimes at 10.0 m, indicating high fire intensity, followed by the MNF
   wildfire and then the MNF prescribed fire. USLE-Forest potential erosion
   estimates were greatest on the MNF wildfire at 21.6 Mg soil ha(-1)
   year(-1) due to slope steepness. The next largest USLE-Forest value was
   6.9 Mg soil ha(-1) year(-1) on the GWJNF wildfire. Both the prescribed
   fire and the 2010 wildfire USLE-Forest values were approximately 0.00 Mg

   decreased heterotrophic respiration (HR) by 21\%. Increases in ER and

Abstract = {{In three different plant communities growing in Mediterranean old fields
   we studied the short-term changes in soil nitrogen availability that
   occur after the fire. Two of these communities were grasslands with
   great capacity of resprouting and contrasted N availability, one
   dominated by Brachypodium retusum, and the second one dominated by B.
   retusum and the N fixing shrub Genista scorpius. The third community was
   an obligate seeder community (shrubland) with low N availability and was
   dominated by Rosmarinus officinalis. We selected six plots for each type
   of vegetation and therefore performed 18 experimental fires. During
   fires we measured temperatures at the soil surface. Maximum temperature
   recorded during fire and time-temperature integral were used as indexes
   of fire severity. During the 6 months following fires we measured Net N
   mineralization and plant uptake by field incubations using the
   resin-core technique in paired burnt and control plots.
   Fire severity increased with plant biomass. In grasslands heating of the
   soil surface increased with plant biomass up to a Limit of 1 kg m(-2) of
   above-ground biomass. For high biomass a large proportion of heat
   released during fire was probably transmitted to the atmosphere or to
   the deeper soil horizons. The increase of soil mineral N was larger in
   fires of greater severity. Most mineral nitrogen released to the soil
   during fire was ammonia. Increases of ammonia post-fire depends on the
   temperatures measured on the soil surface while increases of the less
   volatile N form (nitrate) were related to the amount of burnt biomass
   and were highly dependent on the type of vegetation.
   The amount of nitrogen released to soil during fire represented a small
   proportion of the N mineralized during the 6 months following fire and
   thus the amount of nitrogen mineralized per unit of N released during
   fire was very different across the different types of vegetation. In
   grasslands fire induced changes in N mineralization decreased as fire
   severity increased. In contrast, in shrublands we observed the opposite
   trend. Differences in potentially mineralizable and in net
   mineralization N between unburnt grasslands and shrublands could account
   for this fact. Despite the depression in nitrification that we observed
   in grasslands between 40 and 80 days after the fire, high nitrate
   concentration in the soil during that period increased N leaching in
   burnt plots. No plant uptake was detected at that time. In grasslands
   the onset of plant uptake in burnt plots was delayed as compared to
   control. Cumulative changes in N did not depend on the burnt biomass in
   grassland communities, but it did in the seeder community. On the
   contrary, soil temperatures measured during fires related to changes in
   N observed in grasslands but not in the seeder community. It appears
   therefore, that post-fire N mineralization and leaching in grasslands
   may have been driven by the changes induced by heating the soil surface
   while in shrublands it may have been driven by the quantity of ash
   deposited on the soil surface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Accelerated runoff and erosion commonly occur following forest fires due
   to combustion of protective forest floor material, which results in bare
   soil being exposed to overland flow and raindrop impact, as well as
   water repellent soil conditions. After the 2000 Valley Complex Fires in
   the Bitterroot National Forest of west-central Montana, four sets of six
   hillslope plots were established to measure first-year post-wildfire
   erosion rates on steep slopes (greater than 50\%) that had burned with
   high severity. Silt fences were installed at the base of each plot to
   trap eroded sediment from a contributing area of 100 m(2). Rain gauges
   were installed to correlate rain event characteristics to the event
   sediment yield. After each sediment-producing rain event, the collected
   sediment was removed from the silt fence and weighed on site, and a
   sub-sample taken to determine dry weight, particle size distribution,
   organic matter content, and nutrient content of the eroded material.
   Rainfall intensity was the only significant factor in determining
   post-fire erosion rates from individual storm events. Short duration,
   high intensity thunderstorms with a maximum 10-min rainfall intensity of
   75 mm h(-1) caused the highest erosion rates (greater than 20 t ha(-1)).
   Long duration, low intensity rains produced little erosion (less than
   0.01 t ha(-1)). Total C and N in the collected sediment varied directly
   with the organic matter; because the collected sediment was mostly
   mineral soil, the C and N content was small. Minimal amounts of Mg, Ca,
   and K were detected in the eroded sediments. The mean annual erosion
   rate predicted by Disturbed WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) was
   15\% less than the mean annual erosion rate measured, which is within
   the accuracy range of the model. Published in 2007 by John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This study aimed to assess the hydrological and erosive effects of
   different levels of the fire severity in the drainage basin of the
   Trionto River (Calabria, southern Italy), which was partially burned by
   intense fires during the summer 2017. The analysis focused on the
   identification of wildfire areas using a supervised classification of
   remote sensing images with the minimum distance algorithm. The level of
   severity of each fire was then discriminated based on a procedure
   proposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and adapted to the study
   area. To evaluate how wildfire occurrence affects the hydrological
   behaviour at the basin scale, the SCS-Curve Number model was used to
   document pre- and post-fire conditions in relation with the level of
   fire severity. Finally, the influence on erosion was analysed for
   analogous conditions at the basin scale using the RUSLE equation. The
   effects on hydrological balance and soil loss were evaluated by
   comparing the pre-fire value with three different post-fire scenarios:
   (a) different levels of severity on the surface covered by the fire
   (real case); (b) maximum level of severity on the surface covered by the
   fire; (c) total loss of the canopy and formation of a hydrophobic layer
   on the surface soil. The results confirmed that the level of severity of
   the forest fires, combined with climatic factors, morphological
   conditions, and the pedological characteristics of the basin,
   significantly influence changes to the hydrology and rates of erosion.
   Moreover, these impacts proved to be mainly dependent on the consequent,
   often notable, heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of burned areas
   with different severity.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate peatland wildfires are of significant environmental concern
   but information on their environmental effects is lacking. We assessed
   variation in burn severity and fuel consumption within and between
   wildfires that burnt British moorlands in 2011 and 2012. We adapted the
   composite burn index (pCBI) to provide semi-quantitative estimates of
   burn severity. Pre- and post-fire surface (shrubs and graminoids) and
   ground (litter, moss, duff) fuel loads associated with large wildfires
   were assessed using destructive sampling and analysed using a
   generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). Consumption during wildfires was
   compared with published estimates of consumption during prescribed
   burns. Burn severity and fuel consumption were related to fire weather,
   assessed using the Canadian Fire Weather Index System (FWI System), and
   pre-fire vegetation type. pCBI varied 1.6 fold between, and up to 1.7
   fold within, wildfires. pCBI was higher where moisture codes of the FWI
   System indicated drier fuels. Spatial variation in pre- and post-fire
   fuel load accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in fuel
   loads. Average surface fuel consumption was a linear function of
   pre-fire fuel load. Average ground fuel combustion completeness could be
   predicted by the Buildup Index. Carbon release ranged between 0.36 and
   1.00 kg Cm-2. The flammability of ground fuel layers may explain the
   higher C release-rates seen for wildfires in comparison to prescribed
   burns. Drier moorland community types appear to be at greater risk of
   severe burns than blanket-bog communities.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of recent fire frequency and time-since-fire on plant
   community composition and species abundance in open-forest and woodland
   vegetation in Girraween National Park, south-east Queensland, Australia,
   were examined. Cover-abundance data were collected for shrub and vine
   species in at least 10 400-m(2) plots in each of four study areas. Study
   areas were within one community type and had burnt most recently either
   4 or 9 years previously. Variations in fire frequency allowed us to
   compare areas that had burnt at least three times in the previous 25
   years with less frequently burnt areas, and also woodlands that had
   experienced a 28-year interfire interval with more frequently burnt
   areas. Although species richness did not differ significantly with
   either time-since-fire or fire frequency, both these factors affected
   community composition, fire frequency being the more powerful. Moisture
   availability also influenced floristics. Of the 67 species found in five
   or more plots, six were significantly associated with time-since-fire,
   whereas 11 showed a significant difference between more and less
   frequently burnt plots in each of the two fire-frequency variables. Most
   species, however, did not vary in cover-abundance with the fire regime
   parameters examined. Even those species that showed a marked drop in
   cover-abundance when exposed to a particular fire regime generally
   maintained some presence in the community. Five species with the
   capacity to resprout after fire were considered potentially at risk of
   local extinction under regimes of frequent fire, whereas two species
   were relatively uncommon in long-unburnt areas. Variable fire regimes,
   which include interfire intervals of at least 15 years, could be
   necessary for the continuity of all species in the community.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus brutia Ten. is a characteristic species of the eastern
   Mediterranean. P. brutia and P. halepensis Mill. are distinct species:
   but P eldarica, P stankewiczii and P pityusa are subspecies of P.
   brutia. Fire is the major disturbance in P brutia forests, and several
   adaptations generally contribute to post-fire regeneration of P. brutia:
   however, P. brutia can also naturally regenerate without fire. Flowering
   occurs between March and May. Seed distribution Occurs throughout the
   year, with maximum dispersal in August and the great majority of seeds
   dispersing within the period July-December. P. brutia retains some
   closed cones and so establishes a natural canopy seed bank. Seed
   germination occurs in the rainy season with two frequency peaks: the
   major one in spring and a minor one in autumn. P. brutia seedlings
   develop rapidly-growing tap roots. Shelterwood, clearcutting and strip
   clearcut methods can successfully be applied to P. brutia forests,
   depending on local conditions. Density of P. brutia seedlings was
   greater and seedlings were more vigorous when the natural regeneration
   methods were combined with prescribed fire. Clearcutting methods
   combined with laying cone bearing branches on the surface of the soil
   and additional seeding increases regeneration success. Ground litter of
   2-4 cm creates a medium that reduces evapotranspiration, delays growth
   of competing vegetation, and increases seedling survival. Successful
   regeneration must be established by the end of first vegetation period.}},

Abstract = {{Many plant species are dependent on soil-stored seeds for their
   persistence in fire-prone systems. Seed germination is often stimulated
   by fire-related cues including heat and smoke, but the way these cues
   promote germination may differ between structurally distinct plant
   communities with historically different fire regimes. In this study, we
   examined the effects of heat, smoke and their interactions on the
   germination of soil-stored seeds from shrubby woodlands and herbaceous
   forests in south-east Australia. The effect of these treatments on
   species richness, diversity and composition, and species richness and
   density of germinants within life-forms (grass, forb and shrub) were
   assessed. Soils from each community were subjected to low heat (40
   degrees C), low heat with smoke, smoke, high heat (80 degrees C), high
   heat with smoke and untreated (control) before being placed in a
   glasshouse, where the germinants were identified and counted. Greater
   species richness was stimulated by high heat treatments and smoke in
   both communities, a trend driven by shrubs and forbs, rather than
   grasses. Greater species diversity was stimulated by high heat with
   smoke in both communities. Greater densities of grass germinants were
   stimulated by all treatments, except low heat, in both communities. For
   forbs and shrubs, the effect of treatment depended on community.
   Compared to the control, low heat with smoke (forbs) and both low heat
   and low heat with smoke (shrubs) increased densities in the woodland but
   not in the forest. There were unique species compositions, different
   from the control, in all treatments in the forest but not in the
   woodland, where composition in low heat was not different from the
   control. These results indicate the importance of high soil temperatures
   and smoke in both communities. In the absence of wildfires, recurring
   prescribed burns that heat the soil to low temperatures are likely to
   reduce plant richness, diversity, and density resulting in a change in
   understorey species composition and structure.}},

   vegetation management trials, multivariate statistical techniques were
   used to determine whether any climatic, physiographic or management
   related variables could be related to the time taken for
   competition-induced tree growth suppression to occur. Altitude, the
   method of site preparation (burning versus not burning) and the
   interaction between these two factors were significantly related to the
   timing of tree growth suppression. Regardless of the method of site
   preparation, the onset of competition-induced tree growth suppression
   occurred earlier at lower altitudes, where the vegetation was more
   diverse and vigorous. At higher altitudes, burning appears to stimulate
   the earlier growth of vegetation, reducing the time for

Abstract = {{Canebrakes are monodominant stands of cane (Arundinaria gigantea

   southeastern USA. Canebrakes were important wildlife habitat within the
   bottom land hardwood forest ecosystem. They have been reduced in areal
   coverage by an estimated 98 \% since European settlement due to land
   conversion and the drastic alteration of disturbance regimes in their
   floodplain habitat. Ongoing canebrake restoration efforts are hampered
   by incomplete understanding of the role of natural disturbance in cane
   ecology. We used a large tornado blowdown and multiple prescribed fires
   to quantify the response of cane to the sequential disturbances of
   windstorm and fire in the Tensas Watershed of northeastern Louisiana
   using number and condition of bamboo stems (culms) as response
   variables. We hypothesized that culms would be more abundant in burned
   than in unburned stands and that culm populations in burned stands would
   be younger than in unburned stands. In this study, conducted four years
   post fire, effects of both windstorm and burning were additive and
   beneficial. Results indicate that periodic aboveground disturbance has
   three salutary effects on cane ramet demography: 1) clonal growth
   following disturbances more than compensates for any culms killed; 2)
   the cohort of new culms is younger than the culms they replace; and 3)
   disturbance appears to inoculate some cane stands for several years
   against local die-offs. Fire is a valuable tool for canebrake
   management. By periodically resetting cane stands, fires and other
   disturbances may have played a key role in canebrake formation and

Abstract = {{Ecological studies of century-scale vegetation changes in Australia were
   quantitatively reviewed by assessing relevant papers according to a
   range of methodological and environmental attributes. In general,
   century-scale vegetation dynamics are rarely studied by Australian
   ecologists. Most studies of century-scale changes are short-term studies
   with one sampling period, and few long-term experimental studies exist.
   Century-scale changes are well documented in open forests, grassy
   woodlands, tussock grasslands and rainforests, but little information is
   available from lowland heathlands, herblands or hummock grasslands. Tall
   open forests and rainforests have received the most comprehensive
   attention. Five major genres of research were recognised from a
   multivariate analysis of methodological attributes: (1) single-species
   tree-ring and fire-scar studies; (2) forest dynamics and age-structure
   studies; (3) floristic degradation studies (usually caused by stock
   grazing); (4) archival benchmarking studies; and (5) palynological
   research. These genres tend to focus on different ecosystems and
   ecosystem attributes, giving incomplete pictures of vegetation changes
   even in some well-studied ecosystems. In all genres other than forest
   dynamics studies, century-scale changes are commonly described by
   comparing present conditions with a pre-European reference point, and
   few studies have documented successive vegetation changes within the
   period of European occupation. Considerable opportunity exists to
   document long-term ecosystem responses to successive disturbances

Abstract = {{Reduction of crown fire hazard in Pinus ponderosa forests in the Black
   Hills, SD, often focuses on the removal of overstorey trees to reduce
   crown bulk density. Dense ponderosa pine regeneration establishes
   several years after treatment and eventually increases crown fire risk
   if allowed to grow. Using prescribed fire to control this regeneration
   is hampered by the limited knowledge of fire-related mortality threshold
   values for seedlings (< 1.4 m tall) and saplings (0.25 to 10 cm diameter
   at breast height). The present study was initiated to assess
   fire-related mortality of ponderosa pine seedlings and saplings on
   prescribed burns across the Black Hills. We established plots in several
   burn units after the first post-fire growing season to measure crown
   volume scorch, crown volume consumption, basal scorch, and ground char
   for ponderosa pine seedlings and saplings. Logistic regression was used
   to model the probability of mortality based on tree size, flame length,
   and direct fire effects. Tree size, flame length, crown damage, ground
   char, and basal char severity were all important factors in the
   prediction of mortality. Observed mortality was > 70\% for seedlings but
   was only 18 to 46\% for sapling-sized trees. The differences in
   mortality thresholds for ponderosa pine seedlings and saplings highlight
   their susceptibility to different damage pathways and give managers
   several options when designing burn prescriptions.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing rates of natural disturbances under a warming climate raise
   important questions about how multiple disturbances interact. Escalating
   wildfire activity in recent decades has resulted in some forests
   re-burning in short succession, but how the severity of one wildfire
   affects that of a subsequent wildfire is not fully understood. We used a
   field-validated, satellite-derived, burn-severity atlas to assess
   interactions between successive wildfires across the US Northern Rocky
   Mountains a 300,000-km(2) region dominated by fire-prone forests. In
   areas that experienced two wildfires between 1984 and 2010, we asked:
   (1) How do overall frequency distributions of burn-severity classes
   compare between first and second fires? (2) In a given location, how
   does burn severity of the second fire relate to that of the first? (3)
   Do interactions between successive fires vary by forest zone or the
   interval between fires? (4) What factors increase the probability of
   burning twice as stand-replacing fire? Within the study area, 138,061 ha
   burned twice between 1984 and 2010. Overall, frequency distributions of
   burn severity classes (low, moderate, high; quantified using relativized
   remote sensing indices) were similar between the first and second fires;
   however burn severity was 5-13\% lower in second fires on average.
   Negative interactions between fires were most pronounced in
   lower-elevation forests and woodlands, when fire intervals were <10 yr,
   and when burn severity was low in the first fire. When the first fire
   burned as high severity and fire intervals exceeded 10-12 yr,
   burn-severity interactions switched from negative to positive, with
   high-severity fire begetting subsequent high-severity fire. Locations
   most likely to experience successive stand-replacing fires were
   high-elevation forests, which are adapted to high-severity fire, and
   areas conducive to abundant post-fire tree regeneration. Broadly similar
   severities among short-interval ``re-burns{''} and other wildfires
   indicate that positive severity feedbacks, an oft-posited agent of
   ecosystem decline or state shift, are not an inevitable outcome of
   re-burning. Nonetheless, context-dependent shifts in both the magnitude
   and direction of wildfire interactions (associated with forest zone,
   initial burn-severity, and disturbance interval) illustrate complexities
   in disturbance interactions and can inform management and predictions of
   future system dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Northern and tropical peatlands represent a globally significant carbon
   reserve accumulated over thousands of years of waterlogged conditions.
   It is unclear whether moderate drying predicted for northern peatlands
   will stimulate burning and carbon losses as has occurred in their
   smaller tropical counterparts where the carbon legacy has been
   destabilized due to severe drainage and deep peat fires. Capitalizing on
   a unique long-term experiment, we quantify the post-wildfire recovery of
   a northern peatland subjected to decadal drainage. We show that the
   moderate drop in water table position predicted for most northern
   regions triggers a shift in vegetation composition previously observed
   within only severely disturbed tropical peatlands. The combined impact
   of moderate drainage followed by wildfire converted the low
   productivity, moss-dominated peatland to a non-carbon accumulating
   shrub-grass ecosystem. This new ecosystem is likely to experience a low
   intensity, high frequency wildfire regime, which will further deplete
   the legacy of stored peat carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Catastrophic events such as intensive wildfires have a major effect on
   the dynamics of some wildlife populations. In this investigation, the
   computer package ALEX (Analysis of the Likelihood of EXtinction), was
   used to simulate the impacts of wildfires on the persistence of
   metapopulations of the endangered species Leadbeater's possum
   (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) which is restricted to the montane ash
   forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria. A range of scenarios was
   examined. First, the response of G. leadbeateri to fires in hypothetical
   patches of old growth forest of varying size was modelled.
   Metapopulation dynamics were then modelled in four existing forest
   management areas: the O'Shannassy Water Catchment and the Steavenson,
   Ada and Murrindindi Forest Blocks using GIS-derived forest inventory
   data on complex spatial arrangements of potentially suitable old growth
   habitat patches. The impacts of different fire frequencies and the
   proportion of forest area that was burnt in the Steavenson Forest Block
   and the O'Shannassy Water Catchment were examined. Finally, the combined
   impacts of both wildfires and post-fire salvage logging operations on
   the persistence of populations of G. leadbeateri were assessed.
   Our analyses indicated that, even in the absence of wildfires,
   populations of G. leadbeateri are very susceptible to extinction within
   single isolated habitat patches of 20 ha or less. The probability of
   persistence approached 100\% in patches of 250 ha. The incorporation of
   the effects of wildfire was predicted to have a major negative impact on
   isolated populations of G. leadbeateri. In these cases, the probability
   of population extinction remained above 60\%, even when a single patch
   of 1200 ha of old growth forest was modelled.
   In the absence of wildfires, there was a low probability of extinction
   of G. leadbeateri in the O'Shannassy Water Catchment where very large
   patches of old growth forest presently exist. The risk of extinction of
   the species was significantly higher in the Murrindindi and Ada Forest
   Blocks where there are lower total areas of, and significantly smaller,
   suitable habitat patches. Wildfires resulted in an increase in the
   predicted probability of metapopulation extinction in the four areas
   that were targeted for study.
   An investigation of the Steavenson Forest Block and the O'Shannassy
   Water Catchment revealed that the predicted values for the probability
   of extinction were sensitive to inter-relationships between the
   frequency of fires and the proportion of habitat patches that were burnt
   during a given fire event. The probability of extinction of G.
   leadbeateri was predicted to be lowest when there were frequent fires
   that burnt only relatively small areas of a given forest block.
   Conversely, the results of our analyses suggested that populations of
   the species are vulnerable to infrequent but intensive conflagrations
   that burnt a large proportion of the forest.
   The results of the suite of analyses completed in this study suggest
   that four management strategies will be important for the long-term
   conservation of G. leadbeateri. (1) Attempts to suppress wildfires
   should be maintained as even the largest remaining areas of old growth
   forest may be susceptible to being burnt by repeated widespread
   wildfires that could result in localised and/or global extinction of the
   species. (2) Because the probability of population persistence is
   greatest in those areas that support more extensive stands of old growth
   forest, it will be important to grow relatively large patches of
   existing regrowth forest (over 50 ha) through to ecological maturity.
   This will be particularly important in some wood production forest
   blocks where there are only limited areas of old growth forest. (3)
   Patches that are set aside for the conservation of G. leadbeateri should
   be spatially separated to minimise the risk that all of the reserved
   areas in a region are destroyed in a single major fire event. (4)
   Salvage logging operations should be excluded from stands of old growth
   forest and reserved areas that are burnt in a wildfire. This is because
   such activities can have a major negative impact of the development of
   suitable habitat for G. leadbeateri.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Questions
   The relationship between fire, aridity and seed banks is poorly
   understood in plant community ecology. We tested whether there was a
   close correspondence between the seed bank and standing vegetation
   composition with time-since-fire in a desert. We also examined whether
   longer-lived species showed seed limitation relative to more ephemeral
   species, as this could influence grass-woody ratios in a major biome.
   Location
   Dune hummock grasslands/shrublands of central Australia.
   Methods
   The effects of time-since-fire on floristic and functional group
   composition were examined by comparing plots unburned since 1984 against
   plots that had been burned in 2002. Three methods were used to quantify
   seed abundances: a germination trial using heat and smoke application, a
   flotation method, and a sieving method.
   Results
   Seed bank densities were very low (< 3000 m(-2)). Species similarity
   between the seed bank and standing vegetation was high at sites recently
   burned (0.86) and low in sites long-since burned (0.52). The relative
   abundance of ephemeral species in the seed bank peaked in recently
   burned plots, but the relative abundance of seeds of woody species did
   not match the pattern of abundance in the standing vegetation.
   Remarkably, the dominant perennial grasses and woody species were either
   absent from the seed bank or present at extremely low abundances.
   Discussion
   Differences in the relative abundance of ephemeral species between
   standing vegetation and seed bank relate to the post-fire succession
   process. The small soil pool of seed from woody species may be explained
   by allocation to belowground carbohydrate storage over seed production.
   Field observations suggest, however, that production of strongly dormant
   seed can be prolific and that high levels of seed predation make this
   system strongly seed-limited. The discovery of this seed bank syndrome
   indicates that shifts in grass-woody ratios can be driven by the
   juxtaposition of unpredictable seed rain and fire events in these desert
   dunes. However, estimates of grass-woody ratios due to changing fire
   regimes will be difficult to predict.}},

Abstract = {{Pinyon-juniper ecosystems occur extensively across western North
   America, and at the landscape scale, variation in structure and
   composition is influenced by topographic position, soils, disturbance
   history, and local climate. The persistent pinyon-juniper woodland is a
   common structural form, and though they are known to be infrequent-fire
   systems, there is increasing interest in implementation of hazardous
   fuels reduction treatments in woodlands, especially in the
   wildland-urban interface. Few studies have quantified stand dynamics
   following fuels reduction treatments in persistent woodlands or compared
   treatment outcomes to conditions that develop under natural disturbance
   and successional processes. In 2004, we established a randomized,
   replicated study in woodlands of northern Arizona, and monitored stand
   dynamics and understory responses to determine how stand-level changes
   differed between common fuels reduction approaches. We compared the
   resulting structure with a conceptual state-and-transition model.
   Results showed that, over the 11 yr after treatment, juniper tree
   densities decreased by 8.4\% and 0.9\% but increased by 14.0\% and
   27.3\% in Control, Burn, Thin, and Thin + Burn treatments, respectively.
   Pinyon tree densities decreased by 1.1\% and 3.3\%, increased by 12.2\%,
   and decreased 7.9\% in Control, Burn, Thin, and Thin + Burn treatments,
   respectively. All treatments showed fuel load reductions throughout the
   11-yr study period and minimal rebound of tree recruitment toward
   pretreatment conditions. Prescribed fire alone (Burn) maintained
   persistent woodland conditions. Thinning treatments substantially
   reduced small tree densities and, with the addition of prescribed fire,
   produced losses of large trees. Thinning with prescribed fire (Thin +
   Burn) tended to produce conditions qualitatively unlike those described
   by our state-and-transition model. Evaluation of these commonly used
   fuels treatments against our state-and-transition model suggested that
   concerns regarding loss of ecological integrity may be warranted. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper reports the influence that vegetation recovery has exerted on
   the soil behaviour to erosion by water during both the first and eight
   years after experimental fires. The work was carried out at La Concordia
   Experimental Station (Valencia, Spain), which includes nine plots (4 m
   wide x 20 m long) installed on a calcareous hillside representative of
   Mediterranean shrubland areas. In June 1995 a set of experimental fires
   were carry out at two intensity levels (high and moderate) with three
   plots replication for each treatment. The remaining three plots were
   used as the control. Rain events between June 1995 to June 1996 and from
   June 2002 to June 2003 were monitored and their effect on soil erosion
   processes determined. The vegetation changes (biomass amount and plant
   cover) for each studied period were lalso assessed.
   Total runoff and sediment yield measured during the first post-fire year
   was 19.43 L m(-2) and 561 g m(-2) in the intense fire, and 14.72 L m(-2)
   and 326 g m(-2) in the moderate one, which contrasts with the very low
   runoff (3.82 L m(-2)) and soil loss (8.56 g m(-2)) in control plots.
   Eight years after the fire, the amount of vegetation on the burned plots
   represents between 63 and 69\% compared to the biomass present before
   the fire in 1995. The regeneration of plant cover, up to 30-40\% eight
   years after the fire, facilitated a decrease in the difference of soil
   losses between fire treatments and between burned and unburned plots.
   However, runoff generation still remains greater in burned plots than in
   the control ones eight years after the fire. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{1. In Panama, abandoned agricultural lands that supported tropical rain
   forest are invaded by the exotic invasive grass Saccharum spontaneum,
   which precludes native forest regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate
   the importance of several barriers to forest regeneration and highlight
   mitigation opportunities.
   2. We examined four barriers to natural regeneration: Saccharum
   competition, seed dispersal limitation, fire and soil nutrient
   deficiency. Tree and shrub regeneration was measured in a factorial
   experiment combining Saccharum cutting treatments, distances from
   adjacent forest and a prescribed burn to assess the first three
   barriers, respectively. We compared soil nutrients in Saccharum plots
   with those from adjacent forest. Additionally, we determined the
   importance of distance to remnant vegetation (large-leaved monocots,
   shrubs and isolated trees) on forest regeneration.
   3. Fire significantly decreased plant species richness of forest
   regeneration. Fire inhibited the germination of most species; the effect
   was exacerbated by cutting the Saccharum.
   4. Grass competition significantly decreased seedling growth, while soil
   nutrient deficiency did not affect forest regeneration.
   5. Seed dispersal limitation affected density and species richness.
   Significantly more species (3x) regenerated at 10 m compared with 35 m
   from the forest. Mean seedling densities were, respectively, four, three
   and two times higher under large-leaved monocots, isolated trees and
   shrubs than in open Saccharum. When seed input was experimentally
   equalized, large-seeded species had the highest establishment rate,
   suggesting that if their propagules were dispersed to the site they
   would regenerate in high proportions. However, under natural conditions
   they regenerated poorly and represented the most dispersal-limited
   species group.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that facilitation of
   natural regeneration may be a feasible, low-cost management option for
   restoring native forest cover to large areas. Firebreaks must be
   established to promote biodiversity of forest regeneration. We do not
   recommend Saccharum cutting or fertilization as site treatments. Shading
   effectively eliminates Saccharum. Planting a variety of tree species in
   clumps throughout the Saccharum may overcome dispersal limitations and
   catalyse natural regeneration. Trees that attract different frugivores
   are recommended, especially large-seeded forest species.}},

Abstract = {{Fire and forest disease have significant ecological impacts, but the
   interactions of these two disturbances are rarely studied. We measured
   soil C, N, Ca, P, and pH in forests of the Big Sur region of California
   impacted by the exotic pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, cause of sudden
   oak death, and the 2008 Basin wildfire complex. In Big Sur, overstory
   tree mortality following P. ramorum invasion has been extensive in
   redwood and mixed evergreen forests, where the pathogen kills true oaks
   and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus). Sampling was conducted across
   a full-factorial combination of disease/no disease and burned/unburned
   conditions in both forest types. Forest floor organic matter and
   associated nutrients were greater in unburned redwood compared to
   unburned mixed evergreen forests. Post-fire element pools were similar
   between forest types, but lower in burned-invaded compared to
   burned-uninvaded plots. We found evidence disease-generated fuels led to
   increased loss of forest floor C, N, Ca, and P. The same effects were
   associated with lower \% C and higher PO4-P in the mineral soil.
   Fire-disease interactions were linear functions of pre-fire host
   mortality which was similar between the forest types. Our analysis
   suggests that these effects increased forest floor C loss by as much as
   24.4 and 21.3 \% in redwood and mixed evergreen forests, respectively,
   with similar maximum losses for the other forest floor elements.
   Accumulation of sudden oak death generated fuels has potential to
   increase fire-related loss of soil nutrients at the region-scale of this
   disease and similar patterns are likely in other forests, where fire and
   disease overlap.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous predictions indicate rising CO2 will accelerate the expansion
   of forests into savannas. Although encroaching forests can sequester
   carbon over the short term, increased fires and drought-fire
   interactions could offset carbon gains, which may be amplified by the
   shift toward forest plant communities more susceptible to fire-driven
   dieback. We quantify how bark thickness determines the ability of
   individual tree species to tolerate fire and subsequently determine the
   fire sensitivity of ecosystem carbon across 180 plots in savannas and
   forests throughout the 2.2-million km(2) Cerrado region in Brazil. We
   find that not accounting for variation in bark thickness across tree
   species underestimated carbon losses in forests by similar to 50\%,
   totaling 0.22PgC across the Cerrado region. The lower bark thicknesses
   of plant species in forests decreased fire tolerance to such an extent
   that a third of carbon gains during forest encroachment may be at risk
   of dieback if burned. These results illustrate that consideration of
   trait-based differences in fire tolerance is critical for determining
   the climate-carbon-fire feedback in tropical savanna and forest biomes.}},

Abstract = {{Beginning in the 1850 s, logging, land clearing, and burning were used
   to convert high elevation Hawaiian forests to cattle pasture. Recently,
   declining profits from ranching, the need to expand habitat for
   endangered species, and diminishing supplies of native saw-timber have
   prompted interest in restoring native forests. The Forest Service, in
   cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service, is studying climatic,
   edaphic, and biotic limitations in the reforestation of grassland and
   savanna in the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, island of
   Hawaii. Frost damage has been implicated in poor survival of Acacia koa,
   a dominant native nitrogen fixing tree, and other endemic plants. Data
   showed that for some years freezing temperatures were common above 1800
   m elevation, and that A. koa seedling survival was poorest on
   micro-topographic sites where freezing temperatures were lowest and most
   prolonged. Artificial frost protection devices enhanced A. koa seedling
   survival, presumably by reducing radiative cooling. A similar reduction
   in radiative cooling was observed under a stand of 4 m tall A. koa. Such
   stands also changed soil chemical properties, making them intermediate
   between those of grassland and forest. Light levels near the ground
   under A. koa were similar to those found in forests, but not as low as
   those found under pasture grasses. Biomass and nutrient pools of the
   litter-herbaceous layer were affected by micro-topographic position in
   the landscape and by the presence of stands of A. koa. Using A. koa as a
   nurse crop may create understory conditions favorable for the
   establishment of other plant components of a mixed-species forest. (C)

Abstract = {{1 Smoke-stimulated germination in the post-fire flora of California
   chaparral does not appear to be triggered by nitrate. Application of
   freshly prepared unbuffered KNO(3) solutions (pH c. 6.2) failed to
   enhance germination of five populations of Emmenanthe penduliflora or
   one Phacelia grandiflora population, regardless of light or
   stratification conditions.
   2 KNO(3) buffered at acidic pH (or unbuffered solutions equilibrated
   with atmospheric CO(2)) did induce germination, but KNO(3) solutions at
   pH 7 failed to induce germination. Induction of germination is therefore
   not due to the nitrate ion pet se, but rather to high {[}H(+)], although
   buffered controls gave weak germination at low pH, suggesting a role for
   H(+) plus nitrate. However, other anions such as sulphate were equally
   as effective as nitrate at breaking dormancy.
   3 The germination response to KNO(3) was affected by the type bf filter
   paper used and this may be linked to differences in pH.
   4 NO(2), at concentrations present in biomass smoke, was highly
   effective at inducing germination, and other oxidizing agents also
   induced germination.
   5 Several growth regulators, including nitrite and gibberellin, were
   stimulatory only at acidic pH, but KCN was stimulatory across a broad pH
   range.
   6 Germination decreased at smoke exposures longer than a few minutes.
   Also, smoked water samples effective at breaking dormancy were acidic
   and were less effective when buffered to pH >7.
   7 Physical scarification of the seed coat induced germination but the
   effect was not due to penetration of a water barrier, or to enhanced
   oxygen uptake or to wound responses such as CO(2) or ethylene
   production.
   8 Different effects of the gibberellin inhibitor CCC (chlorocholine
   chloride) suggested that the mechanisms of scarification-induced and
   smoke-induced germination may differ.
   9 We conclude that either oxidizing gases in smoke and/or acids
   generated on burnt sites play a role in germination of post-fire annuals
   in chaparral.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have investigated the response of small mammal

   habitat modification. In this Study we investigated the impact of fire
   on home range, habitat use and activity patterns of the short-snouted
   elephant shrew (Elephantulus brachyrhynchus) by radio-tracking
   individuals before and after a fire event. All animals survived the
   passage of fire in termite mound refugia. Before the fire, grassland was
   used more than thickets, but habitat utilization shifted to thickets
   after fire had removed the grass cover. Thickets were an important
   refuge both pre- and post-fire, but the proportion of thicket within the
   home range was greater post-fire. We conclude that fire-induced habitat
   modification resulted in a restriction of E. brachyrhynchus movements to
   patches of unburned vegetation. This may be a behavioural response to an
   increase in predation pressure associated with a reduction in cover,

Abstract = {{Forest fires throughout the world result in tree mortality that can
   cause substantial timber and carbon losses. There is a critical need to
   map the areas burned by such fires to guide forest management decisions.
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery
   provides inexpensive and frequent coverage over large areas,
   facilitating forest health monitoring. In this study a MODIS post-fire
   image at a spatial resolution of 250 m serves as the starting point of
   an image mining based method. It involves three algorithms: modeling as
   a sum of Gaussian functions, kernel based smoothing, and adaptive
   thresholding. Adaptive thresholding serves as the reference to be
   compared to the image mining based method. Three spectral indices
   specifically designed for burned area identification have been used: the
   Burned Area Index (BAI), the Burned Area Index adapted to MODIS bands
   (BAIM), and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). The kappa statistic is
   applied to quantify the accuracy of the burned areas estimations by
   relating the estimated area with burned area perimeters measured on the
   ground by Global Positioning System (GPS). In addition, the K statistic
   allows us to identify both the optimal spectral index and the optimal
   algorithms' parameters. In this work, an accurate estimation (kappa >
   0.8) of areas burned by forest fires in Mediterranean countries is
   achieved, in particular if the BAIM index is used. The accuracy of these
   estimates is compared with the accuracy obtained by using the reference
   method by a McNemar's test. Results show that our image mining based
   method allows a higher accuracy (the average increase of kappa equals to
   16\%) than the reference method. We conclude that this method adequately
   maps burned areas, and that it may help management agencies to better
   understand of landscape-scale burn patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

   Herbaceous species stored higher concentrations of carbohydrates and had

Abstract = {{Context. Prescribed burning is routinely performed within the Sydney
   Basin as a method of fire-hazard mitigation. Despite the widespread use
   of prescribed fire, knowledge of the impact of prescribed fire on most
   fauna species remains unclear. This is particularly the case for
   bandicoot species.
   Aims. To determine the impact of a low-intensity prescribed fire on the
   survival of the long-nosed bandicoot, Perameles nasuta, and the southern
   brown bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus obesulus (hereafter abbreviated to I.
   obesulus), immediately after the fire and at 5 weeks, 5 months and 13
   months following the fire. To document the spatial ecology and nesting
   requirements of I. obesulus and P. nasuta before and after fire.
   Methods. One I. obesulus and seven P. nasuta (five female and two male)
   individuals were radio-tracked. Animals were tracked before, during and
   following a hazard-reduction burn to assess the impact of fire on home
   range, survival and nesting behaviour.
   Key results. Post-fire survival of P. nasuta and I. obesulus was high
   and the population remained stable up to 5 months following the fire.
   All animals tracked within the burn area (three female P. nasuta)
   survived the passage of fire. The home range for one male I. obesulus
   was found to be 2.35 ha 50\% kernel-density estimate (KDE) and 12.35 ha
   95\% KDE. Female P. nasuta (n = 5) had a home range of 1.3 ha +/- 0.2
   s.e. 50\% KDE and 7.5 ha +/- 1.7 s.e. 95\% KDE. Male P. nasuta (n = 1)
   had a home range of 1.1 ha 50\% KDE and 6.5 ha 95\% KDE. Nesting for
   both species tended to occur in dense vegetation, with a slight shift to
   non-combustible refuge sites post-fire. Animals tended to maintain
   exclusive and relatively stable core home ranges, although overlap of
   non-core home ranges was common.
   Conclusions. The survival of bandicoots following a low-intensity
   hazard-reduction fire was high in the short term; however, further
   research is required to determine how the components of a fire regime
   affect native species, in particular peramelids.
   Implications. Hazard-reduction fires should be used with caution to
   manage the isolated and endangered northern Sydney population of I.
   obesulus, so as to ensure the persistence of this species.}},

   Prescribed fire is a potential restoration tool, but recovery depends on
   nutrient availability and species responses after burning. Fire often

   examined the effects of prescribed fire in the central Great Basin,
   Nevada, USA, on density, biomass and nutrient content of a native
   legume, Lupinus argenteus (Pursh), and the effects of Lupinus presence
   and prescribed fire on soil inorganic nitrogen and on neighboring plant
   functional groups. We examined three treatments - 1 year post-burn, 3
   years post-burn and unburned control in three replicate blocks.
   Extractable soil inorganic nitrogen was variable and, despite a tendency
   towards increased inorganic nitrogen 1 year post-burn, differences among
   treatments were not significant. Extractable soil inorganic nitrogen was
   higher in Lupinus presence regardless of time since fire. Lupinus
   density increased after fire mainly owing to increased seedling numbers
   3 years post-burn. Fire did not affect Lupinus tissue N and P
   concentrations, but cover of perennial grasses and forbs was higher in
   Lupinus presence. The invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum had low

   adopted methodology, using a stochastic model in Monte Carlo simulation
   of FFCs, was found to provide a useful framework for detecting changes
   in flood magnitudes in both pre- and post-fire conditions. In
   particular, the importance of the antecedent soil moisture condition in
   the determination of the flood frequency distribution was analysed. The
   analysis of FFCs for pre- and post-fire conditions shows an increase in
   the average value of Curve Number and a decrease in the catchment time
   lag. The derivation of FFCs shows a clear increase in flood quantiles.
   For the post-fire conditions, the FFC exhibits higher quantiles of the
   peak discharges showing a reduction in frequency of occurrence. This
   variation is more significant for low-return period quantiles than for
   high-return period quantiles. The results of the catchment studies

Abstract = {{Wildfires can completely obliterate above-ground vegetation, yet some
   small terrestrial mammals survive during and after fires. As knowledge
   about the physiological and behavioural adaptations that are crucial for
   post-wildfire survival is scant, we investigated the thermal biology of
   a small insectivorous marsupial (Antechinus flavipes) after a severe
   forest fire. Some populations of antechinus survived the fire in situ
   probably by hiding deep in rocky crevices, the only fire-proof sites
   near where they were trapped. We hypothesised that survival in the
   post-fire landscape was achieved by decreasing daytime activity and
   using torpor frequently to save energy. Indeed, daytime activity was
   less common and torpor expression was substantially higher (>= 2-fold)
   at the post-fire site than observed in an unburnt control site and also
   in comparison to a laboratory study, both when food was provided ad
   libitum and withheld. Basking in the post-fire site was also recorded,
   which was likely used to further reduce energy expenditure. Our data
   suggest that torpor and basking are used by this terrestrial mammal to
   reduce energy and foraging requirements, which is important in a
   landscape where food and shelter are limited and predation pressure
   typically is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important disturbance that shapes global biome
   distributions and maintains the structure, function and biological
   diversity of plant communities in fire-prone environments. Physical,
   chemical and architectural properties of plants are known to affect
   flammability. We wished to explore how these traits contribute to fire
   properties at the individual species level and how flammability varies
   with other plant traits, including recruitment strategy. We studied
   flammability and traits that contribute to it in 29 woody species
   occurring in fynbos and renosterveld shrublands in the Cape region of
   South Africa. Fifteen of the species had fire-stimulated recruitment and
   14 recruit in unburnt, older vegetation. Flammability was measured on
   whole plants or large shoots with intact architecture. Results across
   all species were consistent with other studies in finding that the
   proportions of dead and fine fuel are good predictors of flammability.
   Significantly higher flame temperatures and proportions of sample units
   burnt were recorded for fire-stimulated vs. non-fire-stimulated
   recruiters. These differences were associated with significant
   differences in the dead fuel proportion and fuel bed porosity between
   recruitment strategies. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
   flammability is most likely to be selected for in species that are the
   first to occupy post-burn gaps, where a combination of increased
   flammability and recruitment success enhances their fitness in the
   fire-prone environment. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{It is an essential task for engineers to evaluate the residual strength
   of a fire-damaged steel structure, especially when collapse does not

   established. Then, the remaining load bearing capacity of a simple steel
   frame was evaluated using both the fiber and shell element numerical
   models. Finally, case study about the post-fire residual strength of a
   complex steel truss bridge was carried out. The results show that
   mechanical properties of the structural steels decrease after cooling
   down from an elevated temperature higher than 500 degrees C. Compared
   with the shell element model, the fiber element model is not able to
   predict accurately the post-fire inelastic behavior of a thin-walled
   steel structure. In most cases, the fire-exposed steel bridge still
   retains its original strength. However, it is apparently affected by the
   positions where the fire breaks out. The worst-case scenario is that the
   fire event occurs at the joint near the bearing supports, in which the

Abstract = {{Macrotermes termitaria are conspicuous features of savannah ecosystems
   in the Sudanian and Sahelian zones of West Africa. The mounds, alive or
   abandoned, are a major source of heterogeneity in the landscape. The
   purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of termitaria on
   tree community in a state forest of the Sudanian regional centre (Tiogo
   forest, Burkina Faso), under controlled burning and grazing experiments.
   A comparative inventory was carried out in a split-plot experiment (16
   subplots of 2500 m(2)): 8 subplots where fire regime and grazing were
   controlled and 8 subplots exposed to grazing and with annual prescribed
   fire since 1992. All tree individuals (>= 1.5 m) were recorded, both on
   termitaria and outside and their basal area at stump level was measured.
   A total of 61 observed (or 65.7 +/- 2.4 estimated) tree species were
   recorded on 28 Macrotermes subhyalinus mounds (54 observed species or
   60.8 +/- 3.3 estimated), the immediate surroundings (44 observed and
   59.0 +/- 0.0 estimated species) and the rest of subplots (56 observed
   and 63.6 +/- 0.0 estimated). Specific density was higher on mounds in
   comparison with the surroundings (P < 0.05). Results showed that
   termitaria played a key role in maintaining higher species diversity as
   compared to their surroundings (P < 0.05). Differences in species
   diversity between termitaria and immediate surroundings appeared more
   pronounced in disturbed plots (submitted to both fire and grazing). Some
   species, such as Tamarindus indica, Boscia senegalensis, Cadaba
   farinosa, Capparis sepiaria and Maerua angolensis are found solely on
   termitaria. Besides, the density of trees was significantly higher on
   termitaria compared to the surrounding (P < 0.05), as well as total
   basal area per unit of 100 m(2) area (P < 0.05). We concluded that
   Macrotermes termitaria play an important role as a source of
   heterogeneity in this Sudanian savannah woodland ecosystem. This role is
   particularly important in ecosystems under stresses. Termitaria acted as
   refuge for tree vegetation. The density and dynamics of M. subhyalinus

   Increased aridity and annual and July warming corresponded to spatial
   isotherm shifts of one-half the width of the forest-tundra transition.
   Over the 51-year period, the areal extent of live trees decreased 26\%
   (5227 km(2)) while the areal extent of recently-burned trees increased
   16-fold (7768 km(2)). Changes in the areal extent of treeless wetland,
   tall shrubs, and upland tundra were non-significant. There was
   significant forest loss in the southern forest-tundra and modest forest
   gain in the northern forest-tundra. Overall, forest loss outpaced forest
   gain. The forest-tundra increased in areal extent by similar to 6\% via
   an overall broadening of the transition region. Contrary to model
   predictions, no appreciable northward migration of the forest-tundra was

Abstract = {{Since the mid-1980s, sagebrush rangelands in the Great Basin of the
   United States have experienced more frequent and larger wildfires. These
   fires affect livestock forage, the sagebrush/grasses/forbs mosaic that
   is important for many wildlife species (e.g., the greater sage grouse
   (Centrocercus urophosianus)), post-fire flammability and fire frequency.
   When a sagebrush, especially a Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia
   tridentata ssp. wyomingensis (Beetle \& A. Young)), dominated area
   largely devoid of herbaceous perennials burns, it often transitions to
   an annual dominated and highly flammable plant community that thereafter
   excludes sagebrush and native perennials. Considerable effort is devoted
   to revegetating rangeland following fire, but to date there has been
   very little analysis of the factors that lead to the success of this
   revegetation. This paper utilizes a revegetation monitoring dataset to
   examine the densities of three key types of vegetation, specifically
   normative seeded grasses, normative seeded forbs, and native Wyoming big
   sagebrush, at several points in time following seeding. We find that
   unlike forbs, increasing the seeding rates for grasses does not appear
   to increase their density (at least for the sites and seeding rates we
   examined). Also, seeding Wyoming big sagebrush increases its density
   with time since fire. Seeding of grasses and forbs is less successful at
   locations that were dominated primarily by annual grasses (cheatgrass
   (Bromus tectorum L.)), and devoid of shrubs, prior to wildfire. This
   supports the hypothesis of a ``closing window of opportunity{''} for
   seeding at locations that burned sagebrush for the first time in recent
   history. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   We evaluated the relative importance of stem diameter, height, and bark

   15 \%. Our SLRM analysis indicated that bark thickness, followed by stem
   diameter, were the best predictors of the type of resprouting. There was
   a greater than 60 \% probability that individuals with bark thicker than
   1.6 cm resprouted only epigeally. Our results confirm the resistance

Abstract = {{Garry oak (Quercus garryana) savannas are among the most endangered
   ecosystems in Canada. In coastal British Columbia the vast majority of
   Garry oak savannas have been developed for residential, agricultural, or
   industrial use. Much of the remaining habitat is threatened by conifer
   encroachment or invasion by exotics. In this study tree-ring analysis
   was used to reconstruct stand composition and structure of an oak
   savanna at Rocky Point, on southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia.
   At the time of European settlement, the site was largely open prairie,
   with a few scattered oak trees. Establishment of Garry oak at Rocky
   Point began shortly after settlement of the area by Europeans-probably
   due to the cessation of frequent burning by indigenous peoples. Since
   the 1950s, however, Douglas-fir and grand fir have been encroaching on
   the Garry oak savanna. The causes of this invasion are unclear, but the
   invasion signals a clear transition in the stand structure and
   composition. Oak seedlings are abundant, but few saplings
   exist-suggesting that oak is not regenerating at Rocky Point. Mechanical
   removal of conifers would help maintain the Garry oak community over the
   near future, but given the nearly complete lack of oak recruitment, some
   restoration of ecosystem processes-most likely fire-will be required to
   maintain a functioning Garry oak ecosystem. This management strategy
   will be severely constrained by changes in stand structure resulting
   from decades of fire exclusion, the potential for weedy exotics to
   invade the post-fire communities, and the presence of an ammunition
   depot nearby.}},

   compare the resprouting response of five savanna species saplings burnt

   saplings burnt using an experimental treatment that mimicked a savanna
   fire. Most plants survived the fire, although plant mortality was higher
   for rainforest (19 \%) than savanna (2 \%) individuals, as was stem
   mortality (37 vs. 12 \%). All rainforest and savanna species expressed
   aerial resprouting; two of the savanna species and two of the rainforest
   species did not express basal resprouting. After 1 year, most savanna
   individuals had more and longer shoots than the rainforest saplings and
   had regained their original height, while rainforest plants were on
   average 43 \% shorter than their pre-fire height. These results suggest

   wildfires induced substantial depletion of tree populations.  Taken as a
   whole, fires have significantly reduced the density of black spruce
   populations in forest-tundra uplands, but not in the lowlands.  A
   reduction in tree population density of greater-than-or-equal-to 75\%
   was observed in 22\% of upper boreal forest sites, and 45\% and 93\% of
   sites located in the forest and shrub subzones, respectively, of the
   forest-tundra zone.  Complete exclusion of tree populations by fire was
   observed in 43\% of upland sites in the northern part of the transect,
   while complete removal was a rare event in the southern part.  Sustained
   reduction of tree population density after several destructive fires
   appears as one of the main deforestation processes in the subarctic
   zone.  This leads to the patchy distribution of forest stands and
   scattered tree populations typical of the forest-tundra biome. 
   Comparisons with paleoecological data suggest that the impact of the
   1950s fires contributed to the expansion of the forest tundra into the
   upper boreal forest.  The ecological impact of these fires was probably
   similar to those fires responsible for development of the forest tundra
   during the Holocene.  It is suggested that the fire-climate interaction
   should be considered in order to predict the ecological impact of
   warming climate on high-latitude forest ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in historic fire regimes in eastern North America resulted
   in an array of oak natural communities that were dominant across the
   region. In the past century, savannas and woodlands have become scarce
   because of conversion to agriculture or development of forest structure
   in the absence of fire. Their restoration is a primary goal for public
   agencies and conservation organizations. Although they can be restored
   with a long-term regimen of prescribed burning, a combination of fire,
   timber harvesting, and forest thinning produces the desired structure
   and composition more efficiently. Prescribed fire is useful for
   sustaining oak savannas and woodlands, but it must be used judiciously
   to minimize timber damage and decreases in value. Integrating fire
   within a modified shelterwood approach promotes competitive oak
   reproduction and is flexible enough to produce savannas or woodlands.
   Sustaining these communities requires the replacement of the overstory
   during periods of no fire.}},

Abstract = {{Management of critical habitat for threatened species with small ranges

   antechinus (Antechinus argentus) is known from only two isolated,
   fire-prone locations. At least one of these populations, at Kroombit
   Tops National Park in central-eastern Queensland, Australia, possesses a
   very small range. Here, we present detailed vegetation species diversity
   and structure data from three sites comprising the known habitat of A.
   argentus at Kroombit Tops and relate it to capture data obtained over
   two years. We found differences in both vegetation and capture data
   between burnt and unburnt habitat. Leaf litter and grasstrees
   (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) were the strongest vegetative predictors for A.
   argentus capture. The species declined considerably over the two years
   of the trapping study, and we raise concern for its survival at Kroombit
   Tops. We suggest that future work should focus on structural vegetative
   variables (specifically, the diameter and leaf density of grasstree
   crowns) and relate them to A. argentus occurrence. We also recommend a
   survey of invertebrate diversity in grasstrees and leaf litter with a
   comparison to A. argentus prey. The data presented here illustrates how
   critical detailed monitoring is for planning habitat management and fire
   regimes, and highlights the utility of a high-resolution approach to
   habitat mapping. While a traditional approach to fire management
   contends that pyrodiversity encourages biodiversity, the present study
   demonstrates that some species prefer long-unburnt habitat.
   Additionally, in predicting the distribution of rare species like A.
   argentus, data quality (i.e., spatial resolution) may prevail over data
   quantity (i.e., number of data).}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire plays an important role in ecosystem dynamics, land management,

   Remote sensing technologies provide a means to study fire ecology at
   multiple scales using an efficient and quantitative method. This paper
   provides a broad review of the applications of remote sensing techniques
   in fire ecology. Remote sensing applications related to fire risk
   mapping, fuel mapping, active fire detection, burned area estimates,
   burn severity assessment, and post-fire vegetation recovery monitoring
   are discussed. Emphasis is given to the roles of multispectral sensors,
   lidar, and emerging UAS technologies in mapping, analyzing, and
   monitoring various environmental properties related to fire activity.
   Examples of current and past research are provided, and future research
   trends are discussed. In general, remote sensing technologies provide a
   low-cost, multi-temporal means for conducting local, regional, and
   global-scale fire ecology research, and current research is rapidly
   evolving with the introduction of new technologies and techniques which

Abstract = {{We conducted bird surveys in 10 of the first 11 years following a
   mixed-severity fire in a dry, low-elevation mixed-conifer forest in
   western Montana, United States. By defining fire in terms of fire
   severity and time-since-fire, and then comparing detection rates for
   species inside 15 combinations of fire severity and time-since-fire,
   with their rates of detection in unburned (but otherwise similar) forest
   outside the burn perimeter, we were able to assess more nuanced effects
   of fire on 50 bird species. A majority of species (60\%) was detected
   significantly more frequently inside than outside the burn. It is likely
   that the beneficial effects of fire for some species can be detected
   only under relatively narrow combinations of fire severity and
   time-since-fire. Because most species responded positively and uniquely
   to some combination of fire severity and time-since-fire, these results
   carry important management implications. Specifically, the variety of
   burned-forest conditions required by fire-dependent bird species cannot
   be created through the application of relatively uniform low-severity
   prescribed fires, through land management practices that serve to reduce
   fire severity or through post-fire salvage logging, which removes the

Abstract = {{Lake Tonle Sap, the largest inland water body in Southeast Asia,
   encompasses unique ecosystems and wildlife adapted to large seasonal
   fluctuations in water level. The permanent waterlogged area of the lake
   is encircled by a vast floodplain, the inundated woodland being
   dominated by Barringtonia acutangula (Lecythidaceae), probably a major
   vegetation type of this ecotone, although human impact has degraded the
   floodplain vegetation and developed forest is restricted to a narrow
   band along the shore in the lowest water season. The aspects of
   seasonally inundated vegetation (i.e., variations in physiognomy,
   species composition, stratification, and distribution) on the coastal
   side of the floodplain (approximately 4 km in depth), located adjacent
   to the southern part of Siem Reap, was analyzed. Quantitative data for
   phytosociological evaluation were collected at 67 quadrats (10 m x 10 m
   each) during the low water seasons in 2005 and 2006, the sampling plots
   being classified by Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and
   ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). Two vegetation
   zones (i.e., extensive cropland and disturbed woodland), seven

   ``Shrub,{''} and ``Tall-shrub{''} in the extensive cropland zone and
   ``Scrub,{''} ``Open forest,{''} and ``Closed forest{''} in the disturbed
   woodland zone), and vigorous invasion and/or regeneration of
   Barringtonia acutangula over the study area were identified. Human
   impact (e.g., plowing, burning, and cutting for firewood) seemed to be
   inversely related to both duration of flooding and maximum water depth

   area (S1), short grassland (S2), tall grassland (S3), mixed tall
   grassland and shrubland (S4), and woodland (S5) were selected, and the
   in situ core incubation method was used to estimate nitrogen
   mineralization. Throughout the 60-day incubation in four periods, more
   nitrogen was mineralized at the S3 and S4 sites, the predominantly
   grassland sites, which contained the highest levels of soil organic
   matter (SOM) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), than the S1 site, while
   immobilization occurred at the S2 and S5 sites. Leaching loss decreased
   with successional development of the vegetation, in the order of S1 > S2
   > S3 > S4 > S5. The pattern of nitrogen uptake with ecological
   succession was less conspicuous, being complicated by the immediate
   effect of fire and possibly the ability of the woodland species to
   extract nitrogen from the deeper ground. In the absence of fire for 3 to
   6 years, the build-up of SOM and TKN was accompanied by active
   mineralization, thus paving the way for the invasion of shrub and tree
   species. A close relationship existed between nitrogen mineralization
   and ecological succession with this vegetation gradient. Inherent
   mechanisms to preserve nitrogen in a fire-prone environment including

Abstract = {{Modern ecology often emphasizes the distinction between traditional
   theories of stable, environmentally structured communities and a new
   paradigm of disturbance-driven, nonequilibrium dynamics. However,
   multiple hypotheses for observed vegetation patterns have seldom been
   explicitly tested. We used multivariate statistics and variation
   partitioning methods to assess the relative influences of environmental
   factors and disturbance history on riparian and hillslope Forests. Our
   study area was the Cummins Creek Wilderness, located in the Oregon Coast
   Range. Most of the wilderness burned at least once between the mid-19th
   and early 20th centuries, creating a mosaic of younger forests with a
   few old-growth parches. Species composition on hillslopes varied
   primarily along a climatic gradient from moist maritime environments to
   drier inland climates but was relatively insensitive to forest age
   structure. The abundance of Tsuga heterophylla. a fire-sensitive,
   late-successional tree species, decreased with distance from old-growth
   patches, suggesting possible seed-source limitations following the
   historical fires. In contrast to species composition, hillslope forest
   structure was primarily related to fire history but was largely
   independent of environmental gradients. Old-growth structure
   characteristics such as large dominant trees, large snags, high
   down-wood volumes. and high tree size diversity increased with stand age
   and with the presence of remnant trees that survived the fires. Riparian
   forests had high shrub cover, abundant hardwoods, and high down-wood
   volumes, while the conifer-dominated hillslopes had high overstory
   density and basal area. Maritime climates and their associated plant
   species extended further inland in riparian areas than on hillslopes.
   Advance regeneration densities were higher in riparian forests within 5
   km of the coast than in any other portion of the study area. Riparian
   forest structure and composition were related to both environmental and
   disturbance variables, with stream gradient and size integrating much of
   the fine-scale variability in disturbance regimes. No single theoretical
   framework was sufficient to explain the vegetation patterns observed in
   these forested watersheds. Our findings suggest a conceptual model of
   forest landscapes in which the relative influences of environment and
   disturbance on vegetation patterns are contingent on the facet of
   vegetation considered (composition vs, structure) and the portion of the
   landscape examined (hillslope vs. riparian).}},

Abstract = {{In North American boreal forests, wildfire is the dominant agent of
   natural disturbance. A natural disturbance model has therefore been
   promoted as an ecologically based approach to forest harvesting in these
   systems. Given accelerating resource demands, fire competes with harvest
   for timber, and there is increasing pressure to salvage naturally burned
   areas. This creates a management paradox: simultaneous promotion of
   natural disturbance as a guide to sustainability while salvaging forests
   that have been naturally disturbed. The major drivers of posffire
   salvage in Canadian boreal forests are societal perceptions,
   overallocation of forest resources, and economic and policy incentives,
   and post fire salvage compromises forest sustainability by diminishing
   the role of fire as a critical, natural process. These factors might be
   reconciled through consideration of fire in resource allocations and
   application of active adaptive management We provide novel treatment of
   the role of burn severity in mediating biotic response by examining its
   influence on the amount, type, and distribution of live, postfire
   residual material, and we highlight the role of fire in shaping spatial
   and temporal patterns in forest biodiversity. Maintenance of natural
   posffire forests is a critical component of an ecosystem-based approach
   to forest management in boreal systems. Nevertheless, present practices
   focus heavily on expediting removal of timber from burned forests,
   despite increasing evidence that postfire communities differ markedly
   from postharvest systems, and there is a mismatch between emerging
   management models and past management practices. Policies that recognize
   the critical role of fire in these systems and facilitate enhanced
   understanding of natural system dynamics in support of development of
   sustainable management practices are urgently needed.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Background Fires have been an important natural disturbance and
   pervasive evolutionary force in the boreal biome. Yet, fire suppression
   has made forest fires rare in the managed landscapes in Fennoscandia,
   causing significant habitat loss for saproxylic species such as
   polypores and insects. To better understand how the beetle community
   changes (species turnover) after a wildfire in a landscape with intense
   fire suppression, we monitored beetles with flight intercept traps the
   first 3 years as well as 12 years after a large wildfire in a national
   park in northern Sweden (a control/unburnt area was set up for the last
   year of sampling). Results Species composition changed significantly
   among all studied years with a continuous turnover of species following
   the wildfire. The indicator species analysis showed that year 1
   post-fire was mostly associated with cambium consumers and also the
   pyrophilous speciesBatrisodes hubenthali. Year 2 was the most abundant
   and species-rich year, withTomicus piniperdaas the most important
   indicator species. The indicator species year 3 were mostly secondary
   successional species, fungivores, and predators and were characterized
   by lower species diversity. Year 12 had higher diversity compared with
   year 3 but lower species richness and abundance. A control area was
   established during year 12 post-fire, and our analyses showed that the
   control area and burned area differed in species composition suggesting
   that the beetle community needs longer than 12 years to recover even
   after a low-intensive ground fire. Conclusion The wildfire area hosted
   several red-listed and fire-dependent species suggesting that after a
   century of landscape-level fire suppression in a semi-natural area, the
   reintroduction of fire benefits rare and pyrophilous species and still
   impacts species composition after 12 years. This study implies that fire
   has long-lasting effects on high latitudes and that prescribed burning
   has the potential to benefit biodiversity over decades in these
   landscapes while also highlighting the value of considering the whole
   species community and not only monitoring abundance and richness to
   assess biodiversity after management actions.}},

Abstract = {{1 A fire of unusually great severity (deep burning) burned across the

   to 18, 1968.
   2 Burned-unburned paired study sites around the fire perimeter, which
   had been established in both tundra and forest-tundra in 1973 were
   relocated in 1990. These showed that total vascular plant cover had
   reached prefire levels after 22 years, that tall shrubs had become
   dominant in the tundra and that biomass was now sufficient to support
   another fire. Cryptogams showed minimum recovery between the two
   studies.
   3 In previously treed areas postfire densities of Picea mariana and
   Picea glauca were much lower than before. Betula papyrifera and Populus
   balsamifera, however, showed an increase in density and had extended
   their range into previously treeless areas.
   4 The results obtained have implications for vegetation changes in the
   Circumpolar North related to global warming. It is predicted that
   deciduous tree species with long distance seed dispersal mechanisms will
   increase in abundance and will invade the tundra in a stepwise fashion
   after each fire. This will be most noticeable near northward flowing
   rivers because these valleys provide the habitat for outlier tree
   populations and are therefore a major source of propagules.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivating black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) is highly
   profitable in sites suitable for its development. Land use history is an
   important factor when choosing suitable habitat, and lands with
   non-ectomycorrhizal host species are recommended when introducing T.
   melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in order to reduce competition from
   native, soil-borne ectomycorrhizal (ECM) inoculum. Nearly every year
   Mediterranean wildfires cause the loss of forested lands where soil and
   climatic characteristics are suitable for truffle cultivation.
   Introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in these sites could
   promote reforestation with a native ECM fungus and, in addition, may
   provide economic incentives. We tested the viability of burnt forest
   lands for truffle cultivation by introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated
   Quercus ilex seedlings in burnt forest sites with and without
   resprouting forest species which act as repositories for native ECM
   fungi. We also evaluated the role of the ECM host plants, which resprout
   after a forest fire, in the maintenance and dynamic processes of the ECM
   fungal community. The study followed a factorial design with two levels:
   (1) T. melanosporum-inoculated and non-inoculated Q. ilex seedlings and
   (2) presence and absence of ECM host plants resprouting after the fire.
   We established 10 experimental plots with 360 holm oaks. After four and
   a half years, the truffle-inoculated holm oaks maintained 36 \% of their
   root tips colonized with T. melanosporum, and 10 years after
   plantations, 26.2 \% of the surviving inoculated holm oaks displayed a
   ``truffle burn{''} area. A greater ECM morphotype richness was
   associated with seedlings planted in plots with the presence of ECM host
   plants, whereas the T. melanosporum mycorrhizal ratio was constant.
   These results suggest that reforestation with T. melanosporum-inoculated
   seedlings can be successful following forest fires and highlights the
   competitiveness of this fungus within the ECM community in these soils.}},

Abstract = {{Fires shape fundamental properties of many forest ecosystems and climate
   change will increase their relevance in regions where fires occur
   infrequently today. In ecosystems that are not adapted to fire,
   post-fire tree recruitment is often sparse, a fact that might be
   attributed to a transient lack of mycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizal (EcM)
   fungi play an important role for recruitment by enhancing nutrient and
   water uptake of their hosts. The questions arise whether and for how
   long the EcM community is transformed by fire. We investigated the
   resistance and resilience of EcM fungal communities on a chronosequence
   of 12 Pinus sylvestris stands in Valais (Switzerland) and Val d'Aosta
   (Italy) affected by fire between 1990 and 2006. Soil samples from burnt
   and non-burnt forests were analyzed with respect to EcM fungi by means
   of a bioassay. The number of EcM species was significantly lower in
   samples from recently (2-5 years) burnt sites than non-burnt forest, and
   increased with time since fire reaching levels of adjacent forests after
   15-18 years. Community composition changed after fire but did not
   converge to that of non-burnt sites over the 18 year period. Only
   Rhizopogon roseolus and Cenococcum geophilum were abundant in both burnt
   sites and adjacent forest. Our data indicate fire resistance of some EcM
   fungal species as well as rapid resilience in terms of species number,
   but not in species composition. As long as the function of different EcM
   species for seedling establishment is unknown, the consequences of
   long-term shifts in EcM community composition for tree recruitment
   remain unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Interrelated causes of plant invasion have been gaining increasing
   recognition. However, research on this subject has mainly focused around
   conceptual models. Here we explore whether plant-soil biota feedbacks
   and disturbance, two major factors capable of facilitating invasive
   plants in introduced ranges, interact to preferentially benefit exotics
   compared to native plants. We investigated the influence of fire
   disturbance on plant-soil biota interactions for the invasive Acacia
   longifolia and two dominant natives (Cytisus striatus and Pinus
   pinaster) in Portuguese dune systems. In the first experiment, we grew
   exotic and native plants in soil inoculated with soil biota from
   unburned or recently burned soils collected in an area with small
   invasion intensity by A. longifolia. Soil biota effects on the exotic
   legume A. longifolia changed from neutral to positive after fire,
   whereas the opposite outcome was observed in the native legume C.
   striatus, and a change from negative to neutral effects after fire
   occurred in the native P. pinaster. Fire reduced mycorrhizal
   colonization in all species and rhizobial colonization in C. striatus
   but not in A. longifolia. In the second experiment, we grew the exotic
   and native plants with conspecific and heterospecific soil biota from
   undisturbed soils (area with low invasion intensity by A. longifolia),
   and from post-fire soils (area affected by a fire similar to 12 years
   ago and currently heavily invaded by A. longifolia). The exotic
   benefited more from post-fire than from undisturbed soil biota,
   particularly from those associated with natives. Natives did not
   experience detrimental effects with invasive-associated soil biota. Our
   results show that fire disturbance affected the functional interactions
   between soil biota and plants that may benefit more the exotic than some
   native species. Disturbance may open a window of opportunity that
   promotes invader success by altering soil enemy and mutualistic impacts.}},

Abstract = {{The dominant plant species in native pine forests in Israel (Pinus

Abstract = {{The effect of fire on annual plants was examined in two vegetation types
   at remnant vegetation edges in the Western Australian wheatbelt. 
   Density and cover of non-native species were consistently greatest at
   the reserve edges, decreasing rapidly with incresing distance from
   reserve edge.  Numbers of native species showed little effect of
   distance from reserve edge.  Fire had no apparent effect on abundance of
   non-natives in Allocasuarina shrubland but abundance of native plants
   increased.  Density of both non-native and native plants in Acacia
   acuminata-Eucalyptus loxophleba woodland decreased after fire.  Fewer
   non-native species were found in the shrubland than in the woodland in
   both unburnt and burnt areas, this difference being smallest between
   burnt areas.  Levels of soil phosphorus and nitrate were higher in burnt
   areas of both communities and ammonium also increased in the shrubland. 
   Levels of soil phosphorus and nitrate were higher at the reserve edge in
   the unburnt shrubland, but not in the woodland.  There was a strong
   correlation between soil phosphorus levels and abundance of non-native
   species in the unburnt shrubland, but not after fire or in the woodland.
   Removal of non-native plants in the burnt shrubland had a strong
   positive effect on total abundance of native plants, apparently due to
   increases in growth of smaller, suppressed native plants in response to
   decreased competition.  Two native species showed increased seed
   production in plots where non-native plants had been removed.  There was
   a general indication that, in the short term, fire does not necessarily
   increase invasion of these communities by non-native species and could,
   therefore be a useful management tool in remnant vegetation, providing
   other disturbances are minimised.}},

Abstract = {{Fire shapes the distribution of savanna and forest through complex
   interactions involving climate, resources and species traits. Based on
   data from central Brazil, we propose that these interactions are
   governed by two critical thresholds. The fire-resistance threshold is
   reached when individual trees have accumulated sufficient bark to avoid
   stem death, whereas the fire-suppression threshold is reached when an
   ecosystem has sufficient canopy cover to suppress fire by excluding
   grasses. Surpassing either threshold is dependent upon long fire-free
   intervals, which are rare in mesic savanna. On high-resource sites, the
   thresholds are reached quickly, increasing the probability that savanna
   switches to forest, whereas low-resource sites are likely to remain as
   savanna even if fire is infrequent. Species traits influence both
   thresholds; saplings of savanna trees accumulate bark thickness more
   quickly than forest trees, and are more likely to become fire resistant
   during fire-free intervals. Forest trees accumulate leaf area more
   rapidly than savanna trees, thereby accelerating the transition to
   forest. Thus, multiple factors interact with fire to determine the
   distribution of savanna and forest by influencing the time needed to
   reach these thresholds. Future work should decipher multiple
   environmental controls over the rates of tree growth and canopy closure
   in savanna.}},

Abstract = {{Fire suppression over the last century has increased conifer expansion
   and dominance in aspen-conifer forests, which appears to be a driving
   force behind aspen decline in some areas. The primary objective of this
   study was to examine how increasing conifer dominance affects aspen
   regeneration vigor following the return of fire. The influence of
   physiographic features and herbivory on aspen regeneration vigor were
   also examined. The study was conducted in the Sanford fire complex
   located in the Dixie National Forest in southern Utah, USA, where more
   than 31,000 hectares burned in the summer of 2002. Seven years after the
   burn (at 66 locations) we measured aspen regeneration density and height
   as response variables and former stand composition and density (the
   burned trees were still standing), soil characteristics, slope, aspect
   and presence or absence of herbivory as independent variables. Aspen
   regeneration (root suckering) densities ranged from <500 to 228,000
   stems/hectare with an average of 37,000 stems/hectare. Post-fire aspen
   regeneration density was most strongly correlated with pre-fire stand
   successional status (as measured by stand composition and species
   abundance), with percent conifer abundance (R-2 = -0.55) and overstory
   aspen density (R-2 = +0.50) being the most important. Average aspen
   suckering densities ranged from approximately 60,000 stems/hectare in
   what were relatively pure aspen stands (>90\% aspen) to less than 5000
   stems/hectare in stands where conifer abundance was greater than 90\%.
   Soil C, N, and P showed positive correlations (R-2 = 0.07 to 0.17) with
   aspen regeneration vigor, while soil texture had a relatively weak
   influence on sucker regeneration. Aspen regeneration densities were 15\%
   lower on north facing aspects compared to east, west and south facing
   aspects with slope steepness showing no correlation with regeneration
   vigor. Regeneration density was significantly lower (8\%) at sites with
   evidence of herbivory versus sites where herbivory was absent. Overall,
   the aspen regeneration response in the Sanford fire complex was strong
   despite high wildlife densities, which may be related to disturbance
   size. Where the maintenance of aspen is desired in the landscape we
   recommend promoting fire when the percentage of overstory conifer stems
   is greater than 80\% or overstory aspen density is less than 200
   overstory stems/hectare. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{411}},

Abstract = {{Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests rely on prescribed fire to limit
   encroachment of hardwoods and maintain early successional understory
   communities. However, prescribed fire may alter habitat availability
   while female eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) are
   reproductively active. In addition, the vigor of vegetation regrowth
   post-fire is impacted by both midstory and overstory stand-conditions
   which can be a function of stand age. Therefore, the degree to which
   prescribed fire affects habitat availability and selection of wild
   turkeys may be a function of both time-since-fire and the age of the
   stand fire was applied to. We assessed habitat selection of female wild
   turkeys during their reproductive cycle in a longleaf pine forest
   managed with frequent prescribed fire. We captured 63 female wild
   turkeys during 2015 and 2016 on a longleaf pine-dominated landscape in
   southwestern Georgia, USA, that was managed with 1-3 year fire-return
   intervals applied to relatively small burn blocks (mean size of burn =
   26.02 ha in 2015; 19.84 ha in 2016) on pine stands of varying
   age-classes. We attached Global Positioning Systems units to individuals
   and collected hourly locations from 1 March to 15 August. We then used
   distance-based analyses to estimate daily selection or avoidance of
   vegetation communities relative to the known reproductive phenology of
   individual females. Females selected hardwood stands during pre-nesting
   and post-nesting phases, but avoided them during the incubation phase.
   Females used open vegetation communities during all phases of
   reproduction following pre-nesting. Turkeys selected areas burned <= 2
   years prior but used different seral stages of pine during different
   reproductive phases. Specifically, females selected for recently burned
   mature pine stands during incubation but then selected for recently
   burned young pine stands, mature pine stands burned 2 years earlier, and
   open vegetation communities during brooding. Our findings demonstrate
   that time-since-fire and stand seral age interact to affect how turkeys
   use pyric landscapes. In general, pine stands providing ample understory
   vegetation are favored while females are reproductively active. Our data
   suggests practitioners should try to manage a landscape containing both
   young and mature pine stands and use prescribed fire to create
   understory conditions selected by turkeys across all reproductive
   phases.}},

Abstract = {{During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and
   widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each
   of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I
   detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in
   the sites combined. A compilation of these data with bird-count data
   from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major
   vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky mountain region showed that
   15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire
   communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern
   Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus)
   seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing
   dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in
   recently burned forests are different in composition from those that
   characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including
   early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding
   guilds are especially abundant therein; woodpeckers, flycatchers, and
   seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly
   two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites.
   Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for
   cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the
   basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the
   broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest
   conditions prior to a fire (especially for presence of snags) may be
   important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting
   birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or
   relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be
   necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately,
   the current fire policy of public land-management agencies does not
   encourage maintenance of stand-replacement fire regimes, which may be
   necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most
   fire-dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the
   suitability of burned-forest habitat for birds by removing the most
   important element-standing, fire-killed trees-needed for feeding,
   nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned
   forests.}},

   examines influence of tree composition and disturbance, including fire
   and disturbance corridors, on its spread at the edge of its current
   distribution. We assessed whether lantana spreads in association with
   particular plants, disturbances, or environmental features within
   protected areas. Using 100 m(2) plots, we measured vegetation cover,

   105 plots (84 randomly generated and 21 selected for presence of
   lantana) across submontane woodland in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park

   in association with the native nitrogen-fixing tree Sophora
   chrysophylla, and less common than expected near the exotic
   nitrogen-fixing tree Morella faya. Fire also strongly predicted its
   occurrence, as did proximity to roads: it was absent from all unburned
   plots, and in burned areas it was more common within 200 m of roads.
   Thus, three factors facilitated invasion by lantana: fire, roads, and

Abstract = {{1. Burning of slash (woody debris) piles resulting from the harvest of
   fuel wood is a common management technique designed to reduce fire risk
   and increase establishment of understorey vegetation in many semi-arid
   woodlands. However, the consequences of slash burning on plant
   communities and their below-ground fungal mutualists are poorly
   understood.
   2. We examined how the burning of slash piles affected understorey plant
   communities and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in a pinyon-juniper
   woodland in northern Arizona, USA, 5 years after harvesting. We analysed
   plant communities and AM inoculum potential along 16 transects in: (i)
   burned slash pile sites; (ii) interspaces between burned slash piles;
   (iii) non-burned canopy sites; and (iv) non-burned interspaces. We
   quantified AM colonization of dominant native and exotic plants in
   burned and non-burned areas.
   3. Burned areas had significantly fewer understorey plant species than
   non-burned areas, and exotic species were four times more abundant at
   burned slash sites than at other sites.
   4. Exotic plants from burned and non-burned areas exhibited levels of AM
   colonization that were 50\% greater than native plants. Bioassay and
   field-collected plants exhibited similar levels of AM colonization and
   there were no significant treatment differences.
   5. The total biomass of bioassay plants grown in soil from burned slash
   sites averaged 19\% greater than plant biomass from other sites, and had
   27\% more phosphorus in their shoot tissue; however, tissue nitrogen
   contents were similar.
   6. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that either fire
   did not reduce AM inoculum potential, or that AM fungal populations
   recovered in the 5 years after the slash was burned. Changes in
   understorey plant communities and increases in exotic species with
   burning could result from other soil changes (e.g. species of AM fungi
   present), reduction of native species in the seed bank or greater
   dispersal ability of exotic plants compared with native plant species.
   We suggest that burning slash piles as a management tool in
   pinyon-juniper woodlands can result in plant communities that are
   persistently dominated by exotic species. Management approaches that
   utilize fuel wood harvest alone or that incorporate seeding of native
   plants may achieve the desired results.}},

Abstract = {{Fraxinus pennsylvanica woodlands are an important component of the
   Northern Great Plains ecosystem and critical habitat for many species of
   birds, mammals and plants. Many F pennsylvanica woodlands are decadent,
   declining from closed-canopy to open-canopy stands with few tall shrubs
   and a ground layer dominated by Eurasian meadow grasses. Fire has been
   suggested to facilitate regeneration of these woodlands. Understanding
   the effects of fire on tree recruitment is essential if controlled
   burning is to be used for regenerating F pennsylvanica woodlands. In
   2001 1 subjectively chose one stand with evidence of ground fire and a
   similar unburned stand at each of seven sites where F pennsylvanica
   woodlands had experienced warm-season wildfire between 1988.,and 1998. 1
   measured density of F pennsylvanica seedlings and, number and size of
   crown sprouts for each tree in 3-4 sample plots in each stand.
   Fire had a significant negative effect on Fraxinus pennsylvanica
   regeneration at most sites. Trees in burned stands had three times as
   many crown sprouts (P = 0.02) that were nearly twice as large in
   diameter (P = 0.09) than in unburned stands. However, seedlings averaged
   75\% fewer in burn plots compared to unburned (P = 0.06). Burn plots
   with live mature F pennsylvanica trees remaining had twice as many
   seedlings compared to those in which all mature trees were top-killed (P
   = 0.08). A large number of E pennsylvanica trees were apparently killed
   by fire at several of the study sites. This study did not support using
   fire to restore F pennsylvanica woodlands in eastern Montana.}},

Abstract = {{Despite numerous studies on the response of Mediterranean ecosystems to
   fire, few have measured the respective resilience of vegetation and
   fauna compartments. For 28 years, we conducted an annual monitoring of
   avifauna composition and vegetation structure (cover profile) following
   a severe wildfire in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) stand in southern France.
   Our aim was to estimate the time necessary for this bird-vegetation
   system to return to a state analogous to its pre-fire state. In the
   burned plots, low herbaceous and shrub layers were gradually replaced by
   higher, woody layers of vegetation. Neither bird species richness nor
   inter-annual bird species turnover showed significant differences from
   one year to the next over the study period. In contrast, bird species
   composition did change steadily, leading to an almost complete
   replacement of early-successional species by late-successional ones.
   Using the first axes of multivariate analyses as `proxy variables' of
   vegetation or avifauna recoveries, we estimated by extrapolation the
   recovery times of these two ecosystem components at ca. 50 and 35 years,
   respectively. Towards the end of the study period, the rate of change in
   avifauna composition decreased comparatively to that of vegetation
   structure. Our results show that holm oak woodlands are highly resilient
   and seem to tolerate a similar to 50-year fire interval, even if it
   remains to be assessed how resilient they would be in the case of
   increased fire frequency. More generally, our multivariate approach,
   which allows comparative estimations of resilience in different
   components of an ecosystem using qualitative as well as quantitative
   criteria, could be applied to various case studies in disturbance and
   restoration ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has concluded that forest wildfires in the western
   United States are becoming larger and more frequent. A more significant
   question may be whether the ecosystem impacts of wildfire are also
   increasing. We show that a large area (approximately 120000 km 2) of
   California and western Nevada experienced a notable increase in the
   extent of forest stand-replacing ({''}high severity'') fire between 1984
   and 2006. High severity forest fire is closely linked to forest
   fragmentation, wildlife habitat availability, erosion rates and
   sedimentation, post-fire seedling recruitment, carbon sequestration, and
   various other ecosystem properties and processes. Mean and maximum fire
   size, and the area burned annually have also all risen substantially
   since the beginning of the 1980s, and are now at or above values from
   the decades preceding the 1940s, when fire suppression became national
   policy. These trends are occurring in concert with a regional rise in
   temperature and a long-term increase in annual precipitation. A close
   examination of the climate-fire relationship and other evidence suggests
   that forest fuels are no longer limiting fire occurrence and behavior
   across much of the study region. We conclude that current trends in
   forest fire severity necessitate a re-examination of the implications of
   all-out fire suppression and its ecological impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Regionally-distinctive open oak forest ecosystems have been replaced
   either by intensive agriculture and grazing fields or by denser forests
   throughout eastern North America and Europe. To quantify changes in tree
   communities and density in the Missouri Plains, a grassland forest
   landscape, we used historical surveys from 1815 to 1864 and current
   surveys from 2004 to 2008. To estimate density for historical
   communities, we used the Morisita plotless density estimator and applied
   corrections for surveyor bias. To estimate density for current forests,
   we used Random Forests, an ensemble regression tree method, to predict
   densities from known values at plots using terrain and soil predictors.
   Oak species decreased from 62\% of historical composition to 30\% of
   current composition and black and white oaks historically were dominant
   species across 93\% of the landscape and currently were dominant species
   across 42\% of the landscape. Current forest density was approximately
   two times greater than historical densities, demonstrating loss of
   savanna and woodlands and transition to dense forest structure. Average
   tree diameters were smaller than in the past, but mean basal area and
   stocking remained similar over time because of the increase in density
   in current forests. Nevertheless, there were spatial differences; basal
   area and stocking decreased along rivers and increased away from rivers.
   Oak species are being replaced by other species in the Missouri Plains,
   similar to replacement throughout the range of Quercus. Long-term
   commitment to combinations of prescribed burning and silvicultural
   prescriptions in more xeric sites may be necessary for oak recruitment.
   Restoration of open oak ecosystems is a time-sensitive issue because
   restoration will become increasingly costly as oaks are lost from the
   overstory and the surrounding matrix becomes dominated by non-oak
   species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Improving forest burn severity estimations with partial least squares
   regression and orthogonal signal correction methods in Daxing'an
   Mountains, China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Several indices and simple empirical models and ratios of single band
   from pre- and post-fire Landsat images have been developed to estimate
   and/or map burn severity. However, these models and indices are usually
   site-, time- and vegetation-dependent and their applications are
   limited. The Daxing'an Mountains range has the largest forested area in
   China and is prone to wildfires. Whether or not the existing models can
   effectively characterize the burn severity over a large region is
   unclear. In this study, we used the orthogonal signal correction method
   based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) to select those
   variables that better interpret the variance of burn severity. A new
   index and other commonly used indices were used to construct a new,
   multivariate PLSR model which was compared with the popular single
   variable models, according to three assessment indices: relative root
   mean square error (RMSE\%), relative bias (RE\%) and Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency (NSE\%). The results indicate that the multivariate PLSR
   model performed better than the other single variable models with
   higherNSE\% (68.2\% vs. 67.8\%) and lessRE\% (3.7\% vs. - 8.7\%), while
   achieving almost the sameRMSE\%. We also discuss the spectral
   characteristics of the four selected variables for constructing the
   multivariate PLSR model and their correlation with the field burn
   severity data. The new model developed from this study should help to
   better understand the patterns of forest burn severity and assist in
   vegetation restoration efforts in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The endemic New Caledonian conifer Agathis ovata occurs as an emergent

   Growth, survivorship and recruitment over 5 yr were compared for
   populations from forest and maquis on ultramafic substrates in New
   Caledonia to investigate whether demographic behaviour varied in
   response to the strongly contrasting forest and shrubland environments.
   Growth of seedlings and of small (30-100 cm height) and large (100 cm
   height; 5 cm DBH) saplings was slow, but varied significantly among
   stages, site types and years. The greatest difference in growth rates
   was among stages, seedlings growing 0.34 cm.yr(-1), small saplings 1.06
   cm.yr(-1) and large saplings 2.13 cm.yr(-1). Tree DBH increased by only
   0.05 cm.yr-1 and, based on these rates, individuals with DBH of 30 cm
   are estimated to be more than 700 yr old. Few trees (3.5\%) produced
   cones in any year and seedling recruitment was low, but some recruitment
   was recorded each year in both maquis and forest. Rates of recruitment
   per parent were highest in forest (1.28.yr(-1), cf 0.78.yr(-1)), but the
   higher density of trees in maquis meant that overall recruitment was
   greater there (92 ha(-1) yr(-1), cf 56 ha(-1).yr(-1)). Seedling
   mortality ranged from 0.9 to 2.9\% among years with no significant
   difference between maquis and forest. No sapling mortality was recorded,
   but annual tree mortality ranged from 0 to 1.4\%. Evidence from a
   recently burned site indicated that while trees may survive fire,
   seedlings and saplings do not. Post-fire seedling recruitment per ha
   from surviving trees was four times lower than in unburned sites, but
   growth rates were four times higher.
   Similar demographic attributes, including high survivorship, low growth
   rate and low rates of recruitment over a long reproductive life,
   characterize Agathis ovata populations in both maquis and rainforest in
   New Caledonia and are indicative of a broad tolerance of light
   environments that is unusual among tree species. These demographic
   attributes help to explain the long-term persistence of the species in
   these strongly contrasting habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-induced vegetation change may be delayed in the absence of
   disturbance catalysts. However, increases in wildfire activity may
   accelerate these transitions in many areas, including the western boreal
   region of Canada. To better understand factors influencing decadal-scale
   changes in upland boreal forest vegetation, we developed a hybrid
   modeling approach that constrains projections of climate-driven
   vegetation change based on topo-edaphic conditions coupled with weather-
   and fuel-based simulations of future wildfires using Burn-P3, a spatial
   fire simulation model. We evaluated eighteen scenarios based on all
   possible combinations of three fuel assumptions (static, fire-mediated,
   and climate-driven), two fire-regime assumptions (constrained and
   unconstrained), and three global climate models. We simulated scenarios
   of fire-mediated change in forest composition over the next century,
   concluding that, even under conservative assumptions about future fire
   regimes, wildfire activity could hasten the conversion of approximately
   half of Alberta's upland mixedwood and conifer forest to more
   climatically suited deciduous woodland and grassland by 2100. When
   fire-regime parameter inputs (number of fire ignitions and duration of
   burning) were modified based on future fire weather projections, the
   simulated area burned was almost enough to facilitate a complete
   transition to climate-predicted vegetation types. However, when
   fire-regime parameters were held constant at their current values, the
   rate of increase in fire probability diminished, suggesting a negative
   feedback by which a short-term increase in less-flammable deciduous
   forest leads to a long-term reduction in area burned. Our spatially
   explicit simulations of fire-mediated vegetation change provide managers

Abstract = {{Determining burned area in Canada across fire management agencies is
   challenging because of different mapping scales and methods. The
   inconsistent removal of unburned islands and water features from within
   burned polygon perimeters further complicates the problem. To improve
   the determination of burned area, the Canada Centre for Mapping and
   Earth Observation and the Canadian Forest Service developed the National
   Burned Area Composite (NBAC). The primary data sources for this tool are
   an automated system to derive fire polygons from 30-m Landsat imagery
   (Multi-Acquisition Fire Mapping System) and high-quality agency polygons
   delineated from imagery with spatial resolution <= 30 m. For fires not
   mapped by these sources, the Hotspot and Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index Differencing Synergy method was used with 250-1000-m
   satellite data. From 2004 to 2016, the National Burned Area Composite
   reported an average of 2.26 Mha burned annually, with considerable
   interannual variability. Independent assessment of Multi-Acquisition
   Fire Mapping System polygons achieved an average accuracy of 96\%

Abstract = {{The effects of fire on germination have been extensively studied in many
   ecosystems. Several studies have shown that plant species in ecosystems
   frequently exposed to fire can survive through two main mechanisms:
   vegetative regeneration (re-sprouts) and recruitment of new individuals
   from a fire-resistant seed bank. In Africa, an increase in temperature
   can break seed dormancy and stimulate germination of some herbaceous and
   woody species. In Madagascar, the once widespread highland ecosystems
   dominated by woody species are now highly fragmented and dominated by
   anthropic grasslands and fields, with a significantly reduced area
   occupied by sclerophyllous forests referred to as tapia woodlands'. Six
   species of this endemic vegetation type were studied: Abrahamia
   ibityensis (Anacardiaceae), Aphloia theiformis (Aphloiaceae), Carissa
   edulis (Apocynaceae), Pentachlaena latifolia (Sarcolaenaceae), Uapaca
   bojeri (Phyllanthaceae) and Vaccinium secundiflorum (Ericaceae).
   Germination tests were conducted (i) by soaking seeds in water for 24h
   (imbibition) or (ii) by exposing the seeds to dry heat. Four different
   temperatures (40, 60, 80 and 120 degrees C) were applied, and seeds were
   exposed for 10, 30, 60 and 90min. To simulate hotter faster-burning
   fires, two higher temperatures (100 and 120 degrees C) were also used by
   exposing seeds to dry heat for 5min. The results did not reveal any
   significant effect of 24-h water imbibition on germination. For most
   species, germination decreased with increasing temperature of treatment
   using dry heat. Uapaca bojeri did not germinate under any treatment.
   Further studies on the biological and ecological characteristics of
   tapia woodland species in response to fire are needed to help guide
   conservation, management and restoration activities focusing on this
   endemic vegetation type.}},

Abstract = {{The ingression of woody plants into savannas, known as bush or shrub
   encroachment, has become a global concern. Fire has been acknowledged as
   a key factor in managing woody vegetation in savannas. This study
   assessed the role of fire in determining the total density, structure
   and composition of woody vegetation in Ithala Game Reserve, northern
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed woody vegetation in comparable
   areas with different fire frequencies. In Combretum-dominated woodlands,
   there was no significant effect of fire frequency on the total density
   of woody individuals. In old field grasslands, the density of woody
   plants was greater in areas burnt annually and in areas burnt once every
   10 years, compared to areas burnt once every 2-4 years. In these
   grasslands, areas burnt annually were dominated by woody plants <2 m in
   height. Herbivore and fire interactions may explain these results.
   Multivariate analyses also indicated a significant effect of fire
   frequency on woody vegetation composition. To control dominant
   encroaching trees such as Dichrostachys cinerea and Acacia karroo
   (Vachellia karroo), and the development of macrophyllous thickets, an
   intermediate fire frequency is required (one burn every 2-4 years).}},

Abstract = {{Pinyon and juniper expansion into sagebrush ecosystems results in
   decreased cover and biomass of perennial grasses and forbs. We examine
   the effectiveness of spring prescribed fire on restoration of sagebrush
   ecosystems by documenting burn effects on soil nutrients, herbaceous
   aboveground biomass, and tissue nutrient concentrations. This study was
   conducted in a central Nevada woodland and included control and burn
   treatment plots sampled before and after a prescribed fire. Six native
   understory plant species (Crepis acuminata, Eriogonum umbellatum,
   Eriogonum elatum, Poa secunda secunda, Festuca idaboensis, and Lupinus
   argenteus) important for native sagebrush obligate foragers were chosen
   to represent the understory plant community. L. argenteus is also
   important for system nutrient cycling and nitrogen fixation. Plants were
   collected from three microsites (under tree canopy, under shrub canopy,
   and interspace) common in transitional woodlands during peak growth the
   summer before a spring prescribed burn and each of two summers following
   the burn. Soils were collected from corresponding locations at two depth
   intervals (0-8 and 8-52 cm) to determine the relationships between soil
   and plant nutrients following fire. Microsite affected soil nutrients
   but did not influence plant tissue concentrations with the exception of
   F. idaboensis. Burning resulted in increases in soil surface NH(4)(+),
   NO(3)(-), inorganic N, Ca(2+) Mn(2+), and Zn(2+). Increases in NO(3)(-),
   inorganic N, and Zn(2+) were also observed in deeper horizons. Burning
   did not affect aboveground plant biomass or nutrient concentrations in
   the first year with the exception of F. idahoensis, which had increased
   tissue P. By the second year, all species had statistically significant
   responses to burning. The most common response was for increased

Abstract = {{Conversion of mature oak (Quercus spp.) dominated woodlands to
   shade-tolerant species is a well-documented problem across the eastern
   United States. However, oak woodland restoration within the
   woodland-prairie ecotone of Kansas at the western edge of the eastern
   deciduous forests has not been systematically studied before. Hence, an
   oak-dominated woodland is being used to study the effects of prescribed
   burning and mechanical thinning to encourage oak regeneration within
   this region. A repeated measures design is employed with burn and thin
   treatments, administered in 2015 after conducting a pretreatment stand
   inventory. Resampling was done after two growing seasons. Pretreatment
   inventory revealed oak dominance in the tree class, while competitive
   species such as Cercis canadensis, Ulmus americana, and Juniperus
   virginiana collectively dominated the seedling and sapling classes.
   Thinning reduced the tree density significantly, but when thinning was
   not followed by a burn, both total and Cercis canadensis seedling
   densities increased significantly. The burn treatment, on the other
   hand, controlled Juniperus virginiana seedlings successfully while oak
   regeneration increased. Hence, the most promising results were observed
   when thinning and burning were combined. However, control of C.
   canadensis seedlings remains the major challenge in the future given its
   vigorous recovery two growing seasons after burning.}},

Abstract = {{In southern California, wildfire and urbanization influence landscape
   condition and features. We explored the synergistic effects of these
   disturbances on puma (Puma concolor) movement and habitat preference in
   southern California, USA using a telemetry dataset of >40 individuals
   from 2001 to 2011. We examined post-fire movement of tracked pumas to
   consider the relationship between habitat use and availability as
   animals used the landscape. We also explored puma response to burned
   areas to examine the influence of vegetation cover, time since fire,
   fire frequency, and the synergistic effects of urbanization on puma
   landscape use. We compare our results to those of others by using a
   complementary approach to evaluate how habitat relationships change with
   additional puma data and with consideration of the fire history of the
   landscape. Our analyses suggest that after fires, pumas use burned
   habitats opportunistically, responding to post-fire changes in prey
   density. Additionally, time since fire and fire frequency were useful
   predictors of puma presence at the individual- and population-level. Our
   puma habitat models showed a strong relationship between puma habitat
   use, vegetation, and human developments. Our analysis suggests that fire
   is an important landscape element to consider when evaluating puma
   habitat; pumas opportunistically used recently burned areas in the first
   few years after fire. We identified that pumas avoided grassland
   vegetation types and areas of sparse cover, suggesting that increasing
   fire frequency could affect puma habitat suitability and connectivity in
   the future. Fire frequencies in parts of southern California have
   already increased beyond the threshold to which the ecosystem is
   resilient, and if this trend continues across the region, suitable puma
   habitat may be lost through vegetation-type conversion to homogenous
   non-native annual grasslands, a habitat avoided by pumas during foraging
   and resting. We suggest monitoring responses to increasing fire
   frequency to assess how pumas and other carnivores will be affected by
   large-scale changes that may pose a threat to landscape integrity and
   persistence of puma populations in southern California. (c) 2015 The

Abstract = {{We examined direct and indirect impacts of millennial-scale climate
   change on fire regimes in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska, USA,
   using four lake sediment records and existing paleoclimate
   interpretations. New techniques were introduced to identify charcoal
   peaks semi-objectively and to detect statistical differences between. re
   regimes. Peaks in charcoal accumulation rates provided estimates of. re
   return intervals (FRIs), which were compared among vegetation zones
   identified by fossil pollen and stomata. Climatic warming between ca. 15
   000-9000 yr BP ( calendar years before Common Era {[}CE] 1950) coincided
   with shifts in vegetation from herb tundra to shrub tundra to deciduous
   woodlands, all novel species assemblages relative to modern vegetation.
   Two sites cover this period and show decreased FRIs with the transition
   from herb to Betula-dominated shrub tundra ca. 13 300-14 300 yr BP
   (FRImean = 144 yr; 95\% CI = 120-169 yr), when climate warmed but
   remained cooler than present. Although warming would have favored
   shorter FRIs in the shrub tundra, the shift to more continuous,
   flammable fuels relative to herb tundra was probably a more important
   cause of increased burning. Similarly, a vegetation shift to
   Populus-dominated deciduous woodlands overrode the influence of warmer-
   and drier-than-present summers, resulting in lower. re activity from ca.
   10 300-8250 yr BP (FRImean = 251 yr; 95\% CI = 156-347 yr). Three sites
   record the mid-to-late Holocene, when climatic cooling and moistening
   allowed Picea glauca forest-tundra and P. mariana boreal forests to
   establish ca. 8000 and 5500 yr BP, respectively. FRIs in forest-tundra
   were either similar to or shorter than those in the deciduous woodlands
   (FRImean range = 131-238 yr). The addition of P. mariana ca. 5500 yr BP
   increased landscape. ammability, overrode the effects of climatic
   cooling and moistening and resulted in lower FRIs (FRImean = 145 yr;
   95\% CI = 130-163). Overall, shifts in. re regimes were strongly linked
   to changes in vegetation, which were responding to millennial-scale
   climate change. We conclude that shifts in vegetation can amplify or
   override the direct influence of climate change on fire regimes, when
   vegetation shifts significantly modify landscape flammability. Our
   findings emphasize the importance of biophysical feedbacks between
   climate, fire, and vegetation in determining the response of ecosystems
   to past, and by inference, future climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire temporarily can alter food and cover resources for
   ground-dwelling wildlife, potentially leading to changes in animal
   abundance. Small mammals are an important ecosystem component in many
   terrestrial communities and depend on ground-level vegetation most
   commonly affected by prescribed fire. In this complex system of food and
   cover availability where easier access to food might compromise cover,
   and vice versa, it is imperative to study postfire habitat use by mice
   and other ground-dwelling wildlife. We evaluated effects of time since
   burn and vegetation type on Peromyscus spp. abundance in a longleaf pine
   (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in Fort Bragg Military Installation, North
   Carolina, USA, during 2011 and 2012. We trapped in 5 vegetation types
   and captured 208 individual Peromyscus. Peromyscus abundance did not
   differ among 1, 2, and 3 years postburn upland pine vegetation types,
   although we noted a trend of decreasing abundance as time since burn
   increased; however, abundance was greater in the lowland hardwood
   vegetation type than in open areas (i.e., military drop zones). The lack
   of an effect of time since burn could be due to the short fire-return
   interval at the study site, which limited the time for postburn shifts
   in the composition of the understory from herbaceous to woody plant
   species. Therefore, we suggest future research in the longleaf pine
   ecosystem incorporate a wider time frame to assess short- and long-term
   effects of fire on small mammal populations. (C) 2017 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{1. More effective control of the tsetse fly in Africa will reduce
   constraints imposed by the livestock disease, trypanosomiasis.
   Trypanosomiasis lowers livestock productivity, and in some areas, may
   limit the ability of farmers to keep livestock and plough the land using
   animal traction. Control of the disease may cause the expansion of
   livestock populations and cultivated land area which, in turn, may have
   negative impacts on ecosystem structure and function.
   2. The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of tsetse
   control, through expansion of agricultural land-use. on vegetative
   structure and tree species composition in the Ghibe Valley,
   south-western Ethiopia. This was done by first describing land
   cover/land-use patterns in areas with and without tsetse flies, and then
   quantifying land-use impacts on vegetation.
   3. Land-use/land cover was assessed and quantified by classifying a
   recent LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the valley and analysing
   the abundance of cover types in a geographical information system (GIS).
   Vegetative structure and tree species composition were measured in field
   plots in two types of cultivated fields (oxen and tractor-ploughed), and
   in upland wooded grasslands and riparian woodlands.
   4. Land cover in the Ghibe Valley was dominated by wooded grasslands
   (60\%) and cultivation (26\%), with smaller patches of dense upland
   woodland (9\%) and sparse woodland strips along river courses (3\%).
   Most farms were cultivated by smallholders using oxen (25\% of the total
   cultivated area) with limited areas ploughed by large holders using
   tractors (0.5\%).
   5. The cover of woody plants was highest in riparian woodlands (53\%),
   moderate in oxen-ploughed fields (6\%) and wooded grasslands (9\%), and
   lowest in tractor-ploughed fields (1\%). Species diversity (Shannon
   index - H') was greatest in riparian woodlands (1.6) and smallholder
   fields (1.4), moderate in grasslands(1.0) and low on largeholder farms
   (0.7).
   6. These results highlight the importance of rare but biologically rich
   riparian areas, which should be a focus for conservation. If tsetse
   control, through the expansion of cultivation causes degradation of
   these woodlands, the potential for impact is high.
   7. However, there appear to be few changes in the vegetation in the
   process of conversion of wooded grasslands into smallholder fields,
   which is the likely result of successful tsetse control. A hypothetical
   model of vegetative change in the Ghibe Valley is described in the light
   of the vegetative potential of the area and recent changes in the
   frequency of hunting and burning in the valley.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive woodland expansion in the Great Basin has generated concern
   regarding ecological impacts of tree encroachment on sagebrush
   rangelands and strategies for restoring sagebrush steppe. This study
   used rainfall (0.5 m(2) and 13 m(2) scales) and concentrated flow
   simulations and measures of vegetation, ground cover, and soils to
   investigate hydrologic and erosion impacts of western juniper (juniperus
   occidentalis Hook.) encroachment into sagebrush steppe and to evaluate
   short-term effects of burning and tree cutting on runoff and erosion
   responses. The overall effects of tree encroachment were a reduction in
   understory vegetation and formation of highly erodible, bare intercanopy
   between trees. Runoff and erosion from high-intensity rainfall (102
   mm.h(-1), 13 m(2) plots) were generally low from unburned areas
   underneath tree canopies (13 mm and 48 g m(-2)) and were higher from the
   unburned intercanopy (43 mm and 272 g.m(-2)). Intercanopy erosion
   increased linearly with runoff and exponentially where bare ground
   exceeded 60\%. Erosion from simulated concentrated flow was 15- to
   25-fold greater from the unburned intercanopy than unburned tree canopy
   areas. Severe burning amplified erosion from tree canopy plots by a
   factor of 20 but had a favorable effect on concentrated flow erosion
   from the intercanopy. Two years postfire, erosion remained 20-fold
   greater on burned than unburned tree plots, but concentrated flow
   erosion from the intercanopy (76\% of study area) was reduced by
   herbaceous recruitment. The results indicate burning may amplify runoff
   and erosion immediately postfire. However, we infer burning that
   sustains residual understory cover and stimulates vegetation
   productivity may provide long-term reduction of soil loss relative to
   woodland persistence. Simply placing cut-downed trees into the unburned
   intercanopy had minimal immediate impact on infiltration and soil loss.
   Results suggest cut-tree treatments should focus on establishing tree
   debris contact with the soil surface if treatments are expected to
   reduce short-term soil loss during the postcut understory recruitment
   period.}},

Abstract = {{Birds and vegetation were surveyed in a 9 ha plot in spring 1976 in a 73
   y-old jack pine (Pinus banksiana) - black spruce (Picea mariana) forest
   in northeastern Minnesota. A 1368 ha wildfire burned across the area
   that autumn. The plot was resurveyed in 1977 and periodically through
   2006. Before the fire, birds with the highest importance values were
   Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroica fusca), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus),
   Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) and Bay-breasted Warbler (D. castanea).
   Within 7 y following the fire, canopy tree cover decreased to near zero
   as fire-damaged trees died. Afterwards, the canopy began increasing,
   reaching 53\% cover by 30 y. Shrub cover, 8\% before the fire, peaked at
   over 70\% two decades after fire, primarily as a result of dense jack
   pine and black spruce regeneration, and then decreased to 58\% 30 y
   after fire. The total number of bird species using the area doubled the
   first year following the fire while the number of bird species with
   discernable territories decreased 40\%. Thereafter, territorial species
   began increasing and 30 y after the fire the number exceeded the
   pre-fire richness by 60\%. Overall, density of bird territories
   decreased nearly three-fold the first 3 y after the fire, but by year
   30, was over 56\% greater than in the pre-burn mature pine forest. Loss
   of canopy was related to a reduction in warbler and vireo diversity
   while increases in woody debris and near-ground vegetation were related
   to an increase in ground-brush foragers such as White-throated Sparrow
   (Zonotrichia albicollis) and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina).
   Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) populations increased briefly as trees
   died, and for five years following fire there was an increase in
   woodpeckers and secondary cavity nesting species. At 7 to 10 y after
   fire, White-throated Sparrow, Magnolia Warbler (Dendroica magnolia),
   Chestnut-sided Warbler (D. pensylvanica), Nashville Warbler (Vermivora
   ruficapilla) and Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia) dominated.
   White-throated Sparrow continued to be the most important bird species
   through the first two decades, followed by Magnolia Warbler and Red-eyed
   Vireo. Thirty years after fire, the dominant birds were Nashville
   Warbler and Ovenbird, followed distantly by Veery (Catharus fuscescens)
   Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Least Flycatcher (Empidonax
   minimus) and Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia). Overall, bird
   species using the area after 30 y remained over 70\% higher than in the
   mature forest before the fire.}},

   compared to a No Climate Change (NCC) scenario, which forecast a gradual
   increase to high levels of forest density and carbon stock. In contrast,
   emissions scenarios that included continued high greenhouse gas releases
   led to near-complete deforestation by 2111. GCM-emissions scenario
   combinations that were less severe reduced forest structure and carbon
   stock relative to NCC. Fuel reduction treatments that had been applied
   prior to the severe wildfire did have persistent effects, especially
   under NCC, but were overwhelmed by increasingly severe climate change.
   We tested six management strategies aimed at sustaining future forests:
   prescribed burning at 5, 10, or 20-year intervals, thinning 40\% or 60\%
   of stand basal area, and no treatment. Severe climate change led to
   deforestation under all management regimes, but important differences
   emerged under the moderate scenarios: treatments that included regular
   prescribed burning fostered low density, wildfire-resistant forests
   composed of the naturally dominant species, ponderosa pine. Non-fire
   treatments under moderate climate change were forecast to become dense
   and susceptible to severe wildfire, with a shift to dominance by
   sprouting species. Current U.S. forest management requires modeling of
   future scenarios but does not mandate consideration of climate change
   effects. However, this study showed substantial differences in model
   outputs depending on climate and management actions. Managers should
   incorporate climate change into the process of analyzing the
   environmental effects of alternative actions.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical forest fires have become more common due to interactions
   between deforestation, land clearing, and drought. Forest recovery
   following fires may be limited by nitrogen. Biological nitrogen fixation
   (BNF) is the main pathway for new nitrogen (N) to enter most ecosystems,
   but BNF may be constrained by other nutrients, such as molybdenum and
   phosphorus, which are required for the process. We studied the role of
   BNF 7 years into the recovery of southeastern Amazon tropical forests
   that were burned experimentally either annually or every 3 years between
   2004 and 2010. We hypothesized that, compared with unburned primary
   forests, BNF in burned forests would increase due to the depletion of N
   in the aboveground biomass pool and that soil concentrations of
   molybdenum and phosphorus from ash inputs would increase, reducing their
   potential constraints on BNF. Despite the fires depleting about half the
   aboveground N pool and rapid rates of recovery in leaf biomass and
   litterfall production, we found low rates of both free-living and
   symbiotic BNF. Higher concentrations of molybdenum and phosphorus in the
   mineral soils of the burned forests indicated that these elements were
   likely not limiting BNF. Our results suggest that despite the N demand
   for regrowth post-fire, substantial N stored in soils likely
   downregulates BNF. Overall, we found surprisingly low BNF rates (< 1.2
   kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) in this region of the Amazon, which contrasts with
   the traditional paradigm that (1) tropical forests fix large quantities
   of N and (2) that BNF increases after forest disturbance.}},

   discrimination of imbalanced data?}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{414}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Predicting post-fire tree mortality is a major area of research in
   fire-prone forests, woodlands, and savannas worldwide. Past research has
   relied overwhelmingly on logistic regression analysis (LR) that predicts
   post-fire tree status as a binary outcome (i.e. living or dead). One of
   the most problematic issues for LR (or any classification problem)
   occurs when there is a class imbalance in the training data. In these
   instances, predictions will be biased toward the majority class. Using a
   historical prescribed fire data set of longleaf pines (Pines palustris)
   from northern Florida, USA, we compare results from standard LR and the
   machine-learning algorithm, random forest (RF). First, we demonstrate
   the class imbalance problem using simulated data. We then show how a
   balanced RF model can be used to alleviate the bias in the model and
   improve mortality prediction results. In the simulated example, LR model
   sensitivity and specificity was clearly biased based on the degree of
   imbalance between the classes. The balanced RF models had consistent
   sensitivity and specificity throughout the simulated data sets.
   Re-analyzing the original longleaf pine data set with a balanced RF
   model showed that although both LR and RF models had similar areas under
   the receiver operating curve (AUC), the RF model had better
   discrimination for predicting new observations of dead trees. Both LR
   and RF models identified duff consumption and percent crown scorch as
   important predictors of tree mortality, however the RF model also
   suggested prefire duff depth as an important predictor. Our analysis
   highlights LR limitations when data are imbalanced and supports using RF
   to develop post-fire tree mortality models. We suggest how RF can be
   incorporated into future tree mortality studies, as well as possible
   implementation in future decision-support tools.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape-scale wildfire has occurred in higher frequencies across the
   planet. Fuel reduction treatments to fire-adapted systems have been
   shown to reduce the impact to human values-at-risk. However, few studies
   have examined if these treatments contribute to ecosystem resilience, or
   the capacity of a system to absorb perturbation and return to a similar
   set of structures or processes. We defined short-term metrics of
   resiliency to test the hypothesis that fuel reduction treatments in
   mixed conifer forests increased a fire-adapted system's resiliency to
   uncharacteristically severe wildfire. In addition, we tested the
   hypothesis that fuel reduction treatments reduced burn severity, thereby
   increasing protection for adjacent human communities. We examined a
   mixed conifer forested landscape in the southwestern U.S. that was
   burned by a landscape-scale ``mega-fire{''} in 2011; fuel reduction
   treatments had been established around communities in the 10 years prior
   to the fire. Fire effects were highly variable in both treated and
   untreated forests. However, analysis of resiliency metrics showed that:
   (a) treated units retained a higher proportion of large trees and had
   post-fire tree densities within the natural range of variability; (b)
   the understory herbaceous community had significantly higher cover of
   native grasses in the treated units, but no significant differences in
   nonnative cover between treated and untreated units; and (c)
   high-severity patch sizes were significantly larger in untreated stands
   and covered a larger proportion of the landscape than historical
   reference conditions. Fire severity, as defined by overstory mortality
   and basal area loss, was significantly lower in treated units; on
   average, trees killed per hectare in untreated units was six times the
   number of trees killed in treated units. Fuel reduction treatments
   simultaneously reduced fire severity and enhanced short-term metrics of
   ecosystem resiliency to uncharacteristically severe fire. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We studied the composition and structure of the woody plant community in

   forest. Using rarefaction techniques, the total species richness (adult,
   >0.5 cm diameter, and saplings, <0.5 cm diameter) was significantly
   highest in the logged forest. Basal area and adult plant density were
   similar in the logged and primary forest, and considerably higher than
   those of the burned forest and abandoned road, the last two types having
   more stems per individual. Species composition differed among
   communities; most notably some pioneer species were absent from the
   primary forest. For saplings, the abandoned road had the lowest species
   richness and plant density. Sapling density was highest in the logged
   forest due to one shrub species that was abundant in disturbed areas.
   Saplings of one valuable timber species, Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco,

   to sprout after root damage. Stem densities in the primary and logged

   to have higher densities, but smaller individuals than the primary

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{324}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of fires, fire size, and decreasing fire
   recurrence intervals are major environmental factors in
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems, and are known to affect Aleppo pine
   (Pious halepensis) forests. The fact that in the Mediterranean basin
   most fires are man-made increases the danger of fires recurring at short
   intervals. P. halepensis is a lowland Mediterranean species with a
   disjunct east-Mediterranean population in Israel and Jordan, with the
   Mount Carmel population as one of the few native pine forests in Israel.
   Here we assess the effect of recurrent fires on the regeneration and
   spatial distribution of P. halepensis, as reflected by the number of
   trees at 18 sites, according to the number of previous fires and the
   time elapsed since the last fire. At each site, 100 x 1 m(-2) squares
   were randomly placed to record numbers of trees. Results indicate that
   in most cases the number of pines per unit area is inversely
   proportional to the number of fires. For example, tree density in sites
   that were last burnt during the spring of 2005, varied between 1.2 trees
   m(-2) (single-fire), and 0.25 and 0.39 trees m(-2) in two- and
   three-fire sites, respectively, while in the unburnt control sites pine
   density was 0.46 trees m(-2). The effect of recurrent fires, however,
   was particularly evident when the time interval between two successive
   fires was shorter than 20 years - the time needed for P. halepensis
   trees to mature and produce an adequate canopy seed bank. Apparently,
   not only the number of fires, but also the fire season has a major
   effect on regeneration dynamics. Although frequent recurrent fires
   reduce the number of pines at the site, their total elimination from any
   site never occurred, demonstrating the resilience of this species and
   its accommodation to short-interval recurrent fires. These results are
   crucial for establishing post-fire management programmes in fire-prone
   Mediterranean ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   COLONIZATION: A META-ANALYSIS}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{37-65}},
Abstract = {{Soil fungal communities perform many functions that help plants meet
   their nutritional demands. However, overall trends for fungal response
   to fire, which can be especially critical in a post-fire context, have
   been difficult to elucidate. We used meta-analytical techniques to
   investigate fungal response to fire across studies, ecosystems, and fire
   types. Change in fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization
   were used as the effect size metrics in random effects models. When
   different types of methods for assessing fungal species richness and
   mycorrhizal colonization were considered together, there was an average
   reduction of 28 \% in fungal species richness post fire, but no
   significant response in mycorrhizal colonization. In contrast, there was
   a 41 \% reduction in fungal species richness post fire when assessed by
   sporocarp surveys, but fungal species richness was not significantly
   affected when assessed by molecular methods. Measured in situ, fire
   reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 21 \%, yet no significant response
   occurred when assessed by ex situ bioassays. These findings suggest that
   the putative magnitude of fire effects on soil fungal communities may be
   dependent on the approach and assessment method used. Furthermore,
   biome, but not fire type (i.e., wildfire versus prescribed fire) was a
   significant moderator of our categorical models, suggesting that biome
   might be a more useful predictor of fungal species richness response to
   fire than fire type. Reductions in fungal species richness and in situ
   mycorrhizal colonization post fire declined logarithmically and
   approached zero (i.e., no effect) at 22 and 11 years, respectively. We
   concluded that fire reduces fungal species richness and in situ
   mycorrhizal colonization, but if conditions allow communities to recover
   (e.g., without subsequent disturbance, favorable growing conditions),
   soil fungi are resilient on decadal time scales; the resiliency of soil
   fungi likely contributes to the overall rapid ecosystem recovery
   following fire.}},

Abstract = {{In fire-prone environments, studying the variability of regeneration
   traits is important to show the potential of plant species to survive
   under consecutive post-fire and fire-free conditions. We studied the
   relationship between seed size and germination patterns in Cistus
   salviifolius (Cistaceae), which is a fire-follower species distributed
   throughout the Mediterranean Basin. Since fire plays an important role
   in the life cycle of the studied species, we made a germination
   experiment that included a heat-shock treatment (to simulate fire) and a
   control without a heat-shock (to simulate fire-free conditions) using
   seeds collected from individual plants to assess within-population
   germination responses to fire. Seed germination of most of the
   individuals was stimulated by heat-shock, but the germination
   characteristics showed substantial variation among individuals within
   the population. Mean seed mass (i.e. seed size) was positively
   correlated with germination percentage in the heat treatment, but no
   correlation was found between seed mass and germination percentage in
   the control. On the other hand, mean seed mass was negatively correlated
   with seed mortality both in the heat-shock treatment and in the control.
   The results show that even if the response of the majority of the
   individuals in the population follows the population-level germination
   response of the species, a significant variability in germination
   actually exists within this population (among individuals). Individuals
   with larger seeds may be favored in post-fire conditions, while seed
   size is unimportant in fire-free conditions. Together with the positive
   selective pressure of seed predation over small-seeded individuals, fire
   shapes the within-population variability of the regeneration traits such
   as seed size and post-fire germination in C. salviifolius. This
   variability might have evolved as a bet-hedging strategy against
   unpredictable conditions in the Mediterranean environment, especially
   the occurrence of fire and fire-free periods.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to examine the consequences of the wildfire on
   the differences in qualitative and quantitative composition of the soil,
   and Cu, Pb, Cd, and Zn levels in the soils and plant species of
   Geraniaceae family at Vidlic Mountain, Serbia. Main soil characteristics
   organic matter content, conductivity, redox potential, pH (H2O), pH
   (KCl), and chloride content in soil samples from post-fire areas and
   from fire non-disturbed areas were studied. The optimized three-step
   sequential extraction procedure was applied to the analysis of Cu, Pb,
   Cd, and Zn levels in the soils. Distribution of heavy metals in aerial
   parts and roots of examined species was investigated too. For some
   characteristic parameters of soil, like conductivity, redox potential,
   chloride content, the impact of fire on the soil habitats followed the
   same trend for all plants species. Content of copper, lead, and zinc in
   plant material derived from post-fire areas was generally greater than
   their content in the plants that grew on the area not exposed to fire.
   Although the content of cadmium was generally higher in all fractions of
   the samples from the locality not exposed to the fire, content of that
   metal in the plant parts was reversed. Most characteristics of soil are
   significantly altered as a consequence of fire. Majority of soil samples
   from the post-fire area had increased content of analyzed metals, except
   cadmium. Fire caused slightly increased bioavailability of the examined
   metals. The biggest difference in the content of the studied metals in
   the soil from the post-fire areas and the area not exposed to fire was
   in the fraction which includes metals associated with organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between community composition and
   ecosystem function is essential for managing forests with complex
   disturbance regimes. Studies of animal responses to fire and timber
   harvesting in forest ecosystems typically focus on a single level of
   community diversity. Measures of species abundance and diversity at the
   community level, along with measures of functional diversity that
   incorporate information on species traits, provide opportunities for
   complementary insights into biodiversity responses to disturbances. We
   quantified community and functional responses of a temperate forest
   lizard community to fire and rotational logging using metrics including
   species-specific abundance, community abundance, species richness and
   evenness, as well as trait-based measures of functional diversity. We
   used non-linear regression models to examine the relationships between
   reptile data and time since fire and timber harvesting, using sites
   arrayed along a 30-years post-disturbance chronosequence. We modelled
   responses separately in two major vegetation types: coastal Banksia
   woodland and lowland eucalypt forests. Species and community measures
   offered different insights into the role of fire and logging. Species
   responses to disturbance differed between disturbance type and
   vegetation type. Four species exhibited significant population responses
   to either fire or timber harvesting, while the rest were unaffected by
   either disturbance. At the community level, species richness and
   community abundance increased significantly with time since fire in
   woodland vegetation. In forest vegetation, community abundance decreased
   with time since fire. Surprisingly, community evenness and functional
   diversity did not show marked responses to fire or timber harvesting.
   This is likely a result of trait homogeneity and the asynchrony in
   species responses to disturbance. We advocate using multiple measures of
   community composition - incorporating species-specific information,
   community metrics and functional traits - to ensure a more holistic
   understanding of disturbance ecology in forest landscapes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Decomposition is a determining factor for the functioning of ecosystems
   because litter dynamics (litter fall and litter decomposition)
   constitute a key process in the regulation of the recycling of carbon
   and nutrients. We studied the litter decomposition properties of a set
   of 19 Mediterranean-basin woody species with different post-fire
   regenerative strategies (resprouters and non-resprouters), under
   experimental climate manipulation (simulating warming and drought) over
   a 2-year period. We show that climate change modifies litter
   decomposition of these Mediterranean woody species as litter
   contributions to the soil (g/year) were lower under drought experimental
   conditions. Species with different post-fire regeneration performance
   showed different leaf decomposition patterns, though these patterns were
   influenced by the taxonomical affiliation of the species. As expected,
   the mass loss of the non-resprouter litter, after 2 years, was higher
   than in resprouters. Non-resprouters showed higher nutrient
   concentration per mass of leaf litter after 2 years of experiment than
   resprouters. possibly because they have lost more C-rich biomass,
   allowing high nutrients concentration in the remaining litter. That
   would apply particularly to P as litter N:P ratio was lower in
   non-resprouters than in resprouters. This study suggests that, in
   Mediterranean ecosystems, nutrients' return from leaf litter to the soil
   will be slower under the projected future drier conditions. Furthermore,
   changes in fire regimes that lead to modifications in the abundance of
   post-fire regenerative groups are likely to affect ecosystem's
   functional properties. Thus, if new fire regimes enhance
   non-resprouters' abundance, we can expect a greater return of organic
   matter contributions to the soil and a lower litter N:P. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The long-term impacts of wildfires on animal populations are largely
   unknown. We used time-series data based on a tracking index, from
   coastal NSW spanning 28 years after a wildfire, to investigate the
   relative influence of habitat structure, species interactions and
   climate on post-fire animal population dynamics. The fire had an
   immediate impact on habitat structure, reducing and simplifying
   vegetation cover, which then underwent post-fire successional change
   including an increase and plateau in tree canopy cover; an increase,
   stabilization and then decline in shrub cover; and an increase in ground
   litter cover. Population changes of different animal species were
   influenced by different components of successional change, but there was
   also evidence that species interactions were important. For example,
   bandicoots (Isoodon obesulus and Perameles nasuta combined) increased
   concurrent with an increase in shrub cover then declined at a faster
   rate than a direct association with senescing shrub cover would suggest,
   while the feral cat (Felis catus) population changed with the bandicoot
   population, suggesting a link between these species. Potoroos (Potorous
   tridactylus) increased 10 years after the fire concurrent with the
   closing tree canopy, but there was also evidence of a negative
   association with feral foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Variation in rainfall did
   not have significant effects on the population dynamics of any species.
   Our results suggest that changes in habitat structure play a key role in
   the post-fire dynamics of many ground-dwelling animals and hence
   different fire regimes are likely to influence animal dynamics through
   their effects on habitat structure. However, the role of predatorprey
   interactions, particularly with feral predators, is less clear and
   further study will require manipulative experiments of predators in
   conjunction with fire treatments to determine whether feral predator
   control should be integrated with fire management to improve outcomes
   for some native species.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) in mineral soil accounts for a large portion
   of total ecosystem carbon (C) in boreal forests. We evaluated the
   effects of stand age and disturbance origin on SOC, soil aggregate
   stability, and aggregate-associated SOC in the boreal forests of
   Ontario, Canada. Mineral soils at 0-15 cm depth were sampled in 27
   stands of six post-fire age classes (2- to 203-year-old) and three
   post-clearcut age classes (2- to 29-year-old), each with three
   replications. In post-fire stands, the SOC pool increased from 2- and
   10-year-old to 29-, 85- and 140-year-old, and then decreased in
   203-year-old stands. Aggregate-associated SOC showed a similar trend.
   Abundance of water stable aggregates (>0.25 mm in diameter) was the
   highest in 2-year-old stands. Compared with the same-aged post-fire
   stands, the SOC pool and aggregate-associated SOC were higher, and
   aggregate stability was lower in 2- and 10-year-old post-clearcut
   stands. But the differences in SOC pool, aggregate-associated SOC, and
   aggregate stability between the two stand origins diminished or became
   less dramatic in 29-year-old stands. Our results indicate that aggregate
   stability is more dependent on thermal modification of SOC by fire than
   on aggregate-associated SOC. Our results also show higher SOC pool and
   aggregate-associated SOC but lower aggregate stability in post-clearcut
   than post-fire stands shortly after disturbance; however, differences
   between the two stand origins diminish when stands become older. (C)

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{1-12}},
Abstract = {{One important legacy of fire exclusion in ecosystems dependent upon
   frequent fire is the development of organic soil horizons (forest floor)
   that can be colonized by fine roots. When fire is re-introduced, the
   forest floor is often consumed by fire and heavy overstory mortality,
   often delayed by months, results. We hypothesized that the delayed
   post-fire tree mortality is a manifestation of a cascade of
   physiological stresses initiated by root damage that can also magnify
   the impact of other kinds of damage. We investigated the physiological
   impact of forest floor consumption on longleaf pines (Pinus palustris
   Mill.) subjected to a wildfire in 2005 in a long-unburned (>50 years)
   forest by measuring forest floor consumption, whole tree water use, and
   leaf chlorophyll content. Ten of the 23 study trees died within three
   years post fire. Post-fire sap flux was unrelated to crown scorch, but
   was negatively correlated with forest floor consumption. A segmented
   linear regression revealed declines in sap flux until a threshold of
   31\% forest floor consumption, after which further consumption had no
   additional effect on tree water use. Trees with >30\% forest floor
   consumption beneath their crowns were more than 20 times as likely to
   die as those with less consumption. Chlorophyll content in needles that
   flushed post fire was negatively correlated with crown scorch (R-2 =
   0.60, P = 0.009) though all trees with scorch also experienced varying
   degrees of forest floor consumption. Our results suggest that the
   consumption of the forest floor with the likely concomitant loss of
   roots initiated a decline spiral, driven by an inability to supply
   sufficient water to the crown. Though we did not measure loss of stored
   carbohydrates in consumed roots directly, we infer that this likely
   effect, coupled with decreased crown photosynthetic capacity, eventually
   resulted in substantial overstory tree mortality.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Background A fire management strategy of deliberate patch-mosaic burning
   (PMB) is postulated to promote biodiversity by providing a range of
   habitat patches with different fire histories, habitat qualities, and
   vegetation ages at a given scale. We investigated the response of avian
   fauna to fire, particularly species richness and community composition,
   in a landscape composed of a diversity of vegetation ages including
   long-unburned refuges (age 26 years), compared with a landscape of
   uniform vegetation ages recovering from an extensive and intense fire.
   Results There was no effect of heterogeneity in vegetation age on
   species richness at whole forest management block (about 6000 ha), or
   local (2 ha) scales. There were different responses of particular
   species to vegetation age. Nine species showed responses to vegetation
   age at local (2 ha) scales, which is presumably a surrogate for
   availability of key resources and which changes over time. Australian
   Pipit (Anthus australis Vieillot, 1818) were absent from swamp
   vegetation <3.5 years old, while Spotted Pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus
   Shaw \& Nodder, 1792) were only found in forest vegetation Conclusions
   Mosaics of different vegetation ages had no net benefit for
   biodiversity, as measured by species richness and assemblage
   composition, at the forest block management unit scale. Different
   responses to vegetation age among bird species did not lead to increased
   bird richness at the scale of forest management block. A potential
   advantage of mosaics in conservation of avian biodiversity is through
   preservation of patches of older vegetation ages in the landscape,
   compared to the periodic extensive loss of older vegetation ages in
   wildfires. However, the absence of large-scale effects of vegetation age
   on bird species richness, the tendency for birds to specialize to fuel
   ages >5.5 years in the landscape studied, and indications of flexible
   responses of some species at landscape scales allows some flexibility in
   fuel management strategies and the scale at which they are applied with
   respect to avifauna.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the abundance of serotinous species in southwestern Australia,
   demonstration of the enhancement of fitness through fire, by releasing
   seeds onto an optimal postfire seedbed for seedling establishment,
   rather than following drought death, has not been explicitly explored.
   In this study, we measured seed release, germination and seedling
   recruitment following plant death after fire and simulated drought among
   six serotinous species in southwestern Australia. Burning or heating the
   cones/fruits resulted in a marked increase in follicle opening
   (pyriscence) compared with plant death from drought (necriscence) among
   Banksia but not Hakea. We recorded higher rates of germination, lower
   seedling mortality and better seedling growth in the post-fire
   environments than in unburnt sites not burnt for at least 10 years for
   five species (seeds of the sixth species were non-viable). Seedling
   mortality among the five species of 100 \% occurred in the unburnt plots
   over the first summer, while 28-79 \% of seedlings survived in the burnt
   plots. Soil moisture measurements indicated much lower water
   availability in the unburnt sites even in spring. Our study provides
   strong empirical evidence that serotiny/pyriscence enhances species
   fitness by releasing seeds into an optimal post-fire habitat in contrast
   to that observed from plant/crown death due to drought. In the context
   of the long history of fire in southwestern Australia, the greatly
   enhanced fitness in response to fire rather than severe drought supports
   the proposition that serotiny is a specific adaptation to fire.}},

Abstract = {{The climate, soil, structure and floristics of dry forests in West
   Africa are summarised.  Data from Ghana show that these forests have
   two-peak annual rainfall between 850 and 1350 mm, with 6-10 dry months

   over a variety of rock types; by short stature (tallest trees 10-40 m)
   relatively high deciduousness in the upper canopy and evergreenness in
   the understorey; and by a distinctive flora which changes gradually
   towards areas of higher rainfall but abruptly at the forest-savanna
   boundary.  Dry forests near the forest-savanna boundary form a
   distinctive sub-type as a result of occasional encroachment by litter
   fires which have become more common in the 1980's.
   Evidence is presented to suggest that many parts of the forest zone in
   West Africa may have been subject to fires most often in the dry forest
   types.  Past fires are likely to have had a profound influence on the
   composition of the present forest canopy.  Fire mortality is greatest in
   small trees, whilst drought (without fire) kills more large trees.  This
   thinning process allows rapid recolonisation especially by Marantaceous

Abstract = {{The extent to which wildfire adversely affects spotted owls (.Stria:
   occidentalis) is a key consideration for ecosystem restoration efforts
   in seasonally dry forests of the western United States. Recently, Jones
   et al. (2016) demonstrated that the 2014 King Fire (a ``megafire{''})
   adversely affected a population of individually-marked California
   spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) monitored as part of a long-term
   demographic study in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA because
   territory occupancy declined substantially at territories burned at
   high-severity and GPS-tagged spotted owls avoided large patches of
   high-severity fire. Hanson et al. (2018) attempted to reassess changes
   in territory occupancy of the Jones et al. (2016) study population and
   claimed that occupancy declined as a result of post-fire salvage logging
   not fire per se and suggested that the avoidance of GPS-marked owls from
   areas that burned at high-severity was due to post-fire logging rather
   than a response to high-severity fire. Here, we demonstrate that Hanson
   et al. (2018) used erroneous data, inadequate statistical analyses and
   faulty inferences to reach their conclusion that the King Fire did not
   affect spotted owls and, more broadly, that large, high-severity fires
   do not pose risks to spotted owls in western North American dry forest
   ecosystems. We also provide further evidence indicating that the King
   Fire exerted a clear and significant negative effect on our marked study
   population of spotted owls. Collectively, the additional evidence
   presented here and in Jones et al. (2016) suggests that large,
   high-severity fires can pose a threat to spotted owls and that
   restoration of natural low- to mixed-severity frequent fire regimes
   would likely benefit both old-forest species and dry forest ecosystems
   in this era of climate change. Meeting these dual objectives of species
   conservation and forest restoration will be complex but it is made more
   challenging by faulty science that does not acknowledge the full range
   of wildfire effects on spotted owls.}},

   invasion processes within forest environments.
   In order to determine if Pinus radiata equally invades different dry
   Eucalypt woodland vegetation types, two areas in the upper Blue
   Mountains in New South Wales, Australia were surveyed. Similar levels of
   invasion were observed in both Eucalypt forest types. An average pine
   abundance of 55 individuals for the Eucalyptus oreades and Eucalyptus
   sieheri vegetation type and 49 individuals for the Eucalyptus mannifera
   and Eucalyptus dives vegetation type was recorded in 20 m by 20 m plots
   located 50 In from the plantation boundary. To characterise the spatial
   distribution of the pines, transects were placed perpendicular to the
   plantation edge. As expected pine numbers diminished with distance from
   the plantation, however, large reproductive pine trees were found up to
   4 km from the seed source signifying long distance dispersal.
   Investigation of wildling pine response to fire suggests that it may not
   always be an appropriate management tool. Fire stimulated seed release
   from cones and resulted in high recruitment of seedlings around
   reproductive pines which were large enough to survive the burn.
   Infrequent fires at intervals greater than time to maturity will lead to
   increased pine densities and further spread into the native vegetation.

Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Context Spatial patterns of burn severity strongly control post-fire
   succession and numerous ecological processes in fire-prone boreal
   forests. Burn-severity patterns are strongly tied to weather conditions.
   Understanding how weather influences spatial patterns of burn severity
   is critical for predicting burn severity and fire management strategies.
   Aims We investigated relationships between spatial patterns of burn
   severity and weather variables in the Chinese boreal forests.
   Methods Using satellite imagery, we mapped burn severity for 22 fires
   that occurred between 2000 and 2005. For each fire, we calculated
   metrics of spatial pattern. Using Random Forest models, we quantified
   the relative importance of weather variables in determining spatial
   patterns of burn severity.
   Results High-severity fire patch, averaged 570.5 ha (SD = 1530.6), was
   the dominant outcome, occupying 67.8\% of all area burned across the 22
   fires. High-severity patches were larger, more aggregated, and simpler
   in shape than low- and moderate-severity patches. Patch size of
   high-severity fires increased in drier and less humid conditions, and
   patches were more complex and aggregated with higher wind speeds.
   Conclusion With drier conditions predicted with climate change, spatial
   patterns of burn severity in Chinese boreal forests may become
   increasingly homogeneous, possibly affecting long term ecological
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{In central eastern Korea, there has been a continued effort to sustain
   pine forests because of their value for wood and mushroom production, as
   well as for other resources. Through the analysis of previously burned
   areas, we clarified the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics of pine
   forests by measuring changes in species composition, population
   structure, and the growth rates of major tree species. Vegetation
   analysis was conducted on a series of 100m(2) plots established in
   Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora Siebold. \& Zucc.) and Mongolian oak
   (Quercus mongolica Fisch. Ex Ledeb.) forests situated in three different
   topographic positions on slopes where fire severity varied. We confirmed
   that most pine trees will succumb to even a surface fire, whereas oak
   may be killed following high intensity or infrequent fires but will
   sprout and become dominant. Complete protection from fire favors other,
   more shade-tolerant deciduous hardwoods. Different restoration plans
   apply, based on observed vegetation responses for each topographic zone.
   Near the ridge top, where pine seed sources are most limited, it may be
   necessary to restore pine forests by planting and to control competing
   shrubs and herbs. At the mountain foot, where exotic species and species
   modified by hybridization have invaded aggressively, restoration that
   involves the introduction of natural vegetation is required. Mid-slope
   sites, where pine has been replaced by natural vegetation dominated by
   Mongolian oak, do not require any form of restorative treatment.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We aimed to characterize the size distribution of naturally occurring
   wildfires and to determine how fuel characteristics influence wildfire
   size in a vegetation mosaic of shrublands and woodlands in semi-arid
   southwest Australia. The shape of frequency-size distributions of fires
   can be used to elucidate shifts in the dominant drivers or constraints
   of fire size. We modeled the cumulative frequency-size distribution of
   wildfires in southwest Australia using a segmented linear model with two
   break points. Three fire size categories were defined by the break
   points of the segmented model: ``small'' (<2,286 ha), ``medium''
   (2,286-41,020 ha), and ``large'' fires (>41,020 ha). Break points were
   interpreted as thresholds in fire size that may represent shifts in the
   dominant controls of fire spread.
   We tested whether the influence of fuel characteristics on fire spread
   varied among fire size categories by comparing the composition of
   vegetation types and fuel ages among burnt and adjacent unburnt areas
   using selection ratios (omega(chi)).
   Small and medium fires burnt shrub-dominated vegetation types in
   proportion to their availability (omega(chi) approximate to 1), but
   tended to burn smaller proportions of sparsely-vegetated woodlands
   (omega(chi) < 0.62). In contrast, large fires tended to burn woodlands
   in proportion to their availability (omega(chi) approximate to 1). Young
   fuels (<20 years) were under-represented in burnt areas regardless of
   fire size (omega(chi) < 0.62), while older fuels (<30 years) burnt in
   proportion to their availability (omega(chi) approximate to 1).
   Fire size in semi-arid southwest Australia is generally limited by fuel
   mass in recently burnt areas and by fuel continuity in sparsely
   vegetated woodlands. However, following unusually wet years and
   subsequent growth of ephemeral plants, fuels in woodland vegetation
   likely become spatially continuous and capable of supporting the spread
   of large fires.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents measurements of soil aggregation parameters and
   rainfall simulation experiments from areas of Mediterranean scrubland
   vegetation in La Costera district, in the southern part of Valencia
   Province, Spain. Data were obtained using a portable rainfall simulator
   and from laboratory studies of aggregate stability, using the water-drop
   test and ultrasonic dispersion methods. Three locations were chosen to
   enable the influences of aspect and the post-fire recovery time of the
   vegetation on soil erosion and hydrology to be investigated. The slopes
   studied were (a) a north-facing slope burnt ten years before the
   experiment, (b) a south-facing slope burnt at the same time, and (c) a
   north facing slope, burnt two years before the experiment, similar to
   slope `'a'' in terms of its basic characteristics. The experiments
   demonstrate the importance of both wildfires and aspect on hydrological
   and erosional soil surface processes.
   The north facing slope at La Costera (slope a) has a higher aggregate
   stability than the corresponding south facing slope (slope b). The
   recently burnt north facing slope (c) is intermediate in terms of
   aggregation, but has the most erodible soils because of the lower
   infiltration rates and the low vegetation and litter cover.
   Nevertheless, for the slopes burnt ten years previously, the
   south-facing slope is more erodible than the north-facing one.
   The results suggest that the forest fire ten years ago did not produce a
   persistent degradation of the ecosystem, only higher soil and water
   losses during the first years following the fire. A southern aspect,
   where vegetation recovery rates are slower and the hydraulic stress is
   higher, favours the development of soils with a relatively low aggregate
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of shrublands around the world from altered fire regimes,
   overutilization, and anthropogenic disturbance has resulted in a
   widespread need for shrub restoration. In western North America,
   reestablishment of mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.
   ssp. vaseyana {[}Rydb.] Beetle) is needed to restore ecosystem services
   and function. Western juniper (Juniperus occidentals ssp. occidentals
   Hook) encroachment is a serious threat to mountain big sagebrush
   communities in the northern Great Basin and Columbia Plateau. Juniper
   trees can be controlled with fire; however, sagebrush recovery may be
   slow, especially if encroachment largely eliminated sagebrush before
   juniper control. Short-term studies have suggested that seeding mountain
   big sagebrush after juniper control may accelerate sagebrush recovery.
   Longer-term information is lacking on how sagebrush recovery progresses
   and if there are trade-offs with herbaceous vegetation. We compared
   seeding and not seeding mountain big sagebrush after juniper control
   (partial cutting followed with burning) in fully developed juniper
   woodlands (i.e., sagebrush had been largely excluded) at five sites, 7
   and 8 yr after seeding. Sagebrush cover averaged similar to 30\% in
   sagebrush seeded plots compared with similar to 1\% in unseeded plots 8
   yr after seeding, thus suggesting that sagebrush recovery may be slow
   without seeding after juniper control. Total herbaceous vegetation,
   perennial grass, and annual forb cover was less where sagebrush was
   seeded. Thus, there is a trade-off with herbaceous vegetation with
   seeding sagebrush. Our results suggest that seeding sagebrush after
   juniper control can accelerate the recovery of sagebrush habitat
   characteristics, which is important for sagebrush-associated wildlife.
   We suggest land manager and restoration practitioners consider seeding
   sagebrush and possibly other shrubs after controlling encroaching trees
   where residual shrubs are lacking after control. Published by Elsevier

   biodiversity especially those of riparian forest including their tree
   plant community structure assessment. It also aims to find out the
   environmental factor which influences the species distribution. In that
   regard, 170 forest plots were set in the whole zone to identify the
   major vegetation types via the ordination analysis (detrended
   correspondence analysis). For this step, four types of wood vegetation
   were described. After that, the study was focused on the riparian
   ecosystem where 62 forest plots were setup along the rivers Koumongou,
   Gambara and Komkoumbou. This new batch of data was subjected to
   floristic analysis, structure (diameter and height) correlation analysis
   and spatial analysis of human activities. The results showed that 61
   tree species belonged to 25 families in the riparian forest. The species
   were absolutely dominated by mesophanerophytes, microphanerophytes,
   Sudano-Zambezian and Sudanian species. In spite of its destruction and
   degradation which is observed in the places with high human pressure,
   the riparian forest still presents a stable growth based on the
   structure feature. Fabaccae, Combretaccae, Rubiaceae, Anacardiaceae, and
   Moraceae were listed as important families in the areas, but this
   potential floristic resource was almost threatened by activities such as
   farming, pasture, burning, and tree cutting. The ecological restoration
   of the bank is needed through the program of participative

Abstract = {{The ground flora stratum affects stand structure, resource acquisition,

   Disturbances such as thinning and prescribed fire alter forest
   understory growing conditions that generally increase ground flora cover

   three growing seasons after fire in thinned and frequently burned
   (3-year rotation) Pinus-Quercus stands. Our results corroborated trends
   from other studies that indicated greater ground flora richness and
   cover after thinning and burning compared with thin-only treatments. We
   also found that the stratum experienced relatively rapid succession
   between growing seasons that complimented the tolerance succession
   model. Forbs had reduced cover and richness from increasingly difficult
   growing conditions over time and were replaced by woody plants, shrubs,
   and seedlings. This likely occurred from changing competition dynamics
   that favored quick growth in the first growing season and long-term
   investment in vertical growth in the third growing season. The
   successful regeneration pathways also fit ground flora regeneration
   models and added a unique pathway to strengthen the predictive power of
   these models. As many stand management goals are focused towards
   improving biodiversity, prescribed fire and thinning may be used to
   increase understory richness in Pinus-Quercus stands.}},

   uncertainty assessment following wildfire. In 2009, after 8 years of
   study, the Lockheed Fire burned the treatment and control watersheds of
   a paired watershed study in coastal California, USA, eliminating the
   ability to continue a paired watershed before-after control-intervention
   (BACI) study design. An alternative analysis was used to detect
   stormflow and sediment load changes due to the wildfire by comparing
   measured posttreatment stormflow and sediment load with simulated
   predisturbance responses predicted with the hydrologic models HBV-EC and
   DHSVM. High natural variability of stormflow and sediment measurements
   compounded with uncertainty associated with the hydrologic models and
   climate suggest that only large changes can be detected. The fire and
   subsequent salvage harvest created an approximately 9\%-12\% reduction
   in forest overstory canopy and a 70\%-90\% consumption of understory
   vegetation. No discernible changes in slopes of regression lines were
   detected between predisturbance and postfire stormflow volumes,
   peakflows, or sediment loads. No changes were detected in stormflow
   volume, peakflow, or sediment loads comparing pre- and post-fire
   vegetation inputs to the hydrologic model DHSVM. The lack of detected
   change in streamflow to accelerate stream channel erosion combined with
   low to moderate fire severity adjacent to stream channels most likely
   were the reasons for no detected postfire change to sediment loads.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires play a critical role in landscape transformation,
   vegetation succession, soil degradation and air quality. Improvements in
   fire risk estimation are vital to reduce the negative impacts of fire,
   either by lessen burn severity or intensity through fuel management, or

   This paper presents the methods to generate the input variables and the
   risk integration developed within the Firemap project (funded under the
   Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology) to map wildland fire risk
   for several regions of Spain. After defining the conceptual scheme for
   fire risk assessment, the paper describes the methods used to generate
   the risk parameters, and presents proposals for their integration into
   synthetic risk indices. The generation of the input variables was based
   on an extensive use of geographic information system and remote sensing
   technologies, since the project was intended to provide a spatial and
   temporal assessment of risk conditions. All variables were mapped at 1
   km(2) spatial resolution, and were integrated into a web-mapping service
   system. This service was active in the summer of 2007 for
   semi-operational testing of end-users. The paper also presents the first

Abstract = {{To more effectively manage remaining native grasslands and declining
   populations of prairie passerine birds, linkages between disturbance
   regimes, vegetation, and bird abundance need to be more fully
   understood. Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on
   mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in
   northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a
   habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on
   upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994
   breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition
   at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point,
   with over 80\% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15
   years. Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure
   from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately
   after fire, to increasing and moderate:amounts of forbs, litter, and
   shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with
   little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (>80
   years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood
   NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and
   abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks
   (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le
   Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii),
   and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to
   an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned
   units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and
   Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance
   on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity,
   managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas
   with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or
   more) fire return intervals. Because long-term rest may create habitat
   unfavorable for most species of grassland passerines in mesic, northern
   mixed prairie, periodic defoliations by disturbances such as fire should
   be considered essential to restore and maintain native biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Pine (Pinus spp.)-dominated forests are commonly managed with prescribed
   fire in the southeastern United States to reduce fuel loads, maintain
   diverse plant communities, and increase habitat quality for wildlife.
   Prescribed fire alters understory vegetation, which is a key component
   of nesting habitat for ground-nesting birds. We assessed the influences
   of vegetation, prescribed fire, and landscape features (e.g., roads,
   edge) on nest site selection and nest survival of eastern wild turkeys
   (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) in a pine-dominated ecosystem in
   west-central Louisiana. We radio-marked 55 female wild turkeys and
   evaluated vegetation and landscape characteristics associated with 69
   nests during the 2014 and 2015 reproductive periods. We used conditional
   logistic regressions with matched-pairs case-control sampling and
   information-theoretic approaches to determine if vegetation
   characteristics within 15m of a nest site, distances to surrounding
   vegetation communities and edges, and prescribed fire history of patches
   where a nest was located influenced nest site selection. We calculated
   hazard ratios for covariates in our top-performing models to determine
   if any of these characteristics affected nest site survival. Turkeys in
   our study had a longer reproductive season and higher nesting and
   renesting rates relative to other populations in the southeastern United
   States. At the local scale, turkeys nested in areas with higher percent
   ground cover vegetation. At the landscape scale, turkeys nested closer
   to roads and farther from edges of 2 plant communities. Turkeys selected
   to nest in forest stands burned 2 years prior. Nest survival was not
   affected by percent ground cover, distance to roads, or distance to edge
   but was negatively associated with time-sincefire; turkey nests in
   stands burned >= 3 years prior had lower survival than nests in stands
   burned the current year. We suggest that burning on a 3-year fire return
   interval is compatible with management for wild turkeys in southeastern
   pine-dominated forests. (C) 2017 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Alcoa World Alumina Australia has been rehabilitating bauxite mines in
   the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of Western Australia for more
   than 35 years. It is a requirement of Alcoa's completion criteria that
   rehabilitated areas can be incorporated into the prescribed burning
   program implemented in the surrounding forest. Rehabilitated areas may
   be more susceptible to nutrient losses following burning because of
   their relatively young age and reliance on N fixation from a legume
   understorey. The objective of this study was to assess the impact that
   prescribed burning has on the nutrient pools within rehabilitated
   ecosystems 5 and 8 years after fire, and compare these responses to
   unburnt rehabilitated areas and the unmined forest. The nutrient status
   of sites established in previous studies were assessed five (burnt and
   unburnt forest, 1989 and 1992 rehabilitation) and 8 (spring, autumn and
   unburnt 1981/1982 rehabilitation) years after burning. Soil, litter and
   understorey samples were collected and analysed for nutrient content.
   Burning 1981/1982 rehabilitation in either season 8 years earlier had no
   long-term negative effect on the nutrient status of the rehabilitation
   compared to the unburnt controls. Spring burning increased the nitrogen
   status of the rehabilitated areas by 52 kg ha(-1) compared with the
   unburnt control. Sites rehabilitated in 1989 and burnt 5 years ago
   showed similar post-fire recovery of nitrogen status to that of the
   burnt native forest sites (77-85\%), while 1992 rehabilitation sites had
   only recovered 52\% of the of the nitrogen of the unburnt sites.
   Therefore, the impact of burning on nitrogen status was greatest in the
   5-year-old rehabilitation and least in the 12-13-year-old sites.
   Phosphorus was less affected by burning than nitrogen largely because
   the majority of P is bound in the soil in the jarrah forest. It is
   recommended that rehabilitated sites are burnt under low intensity in
   spring when they are 12-15-year-old to ensure rapid post-fire recovery
   of nutrients. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One manner in which elephants utilize trees is by removing their bark.
   This type of utilization is concentrated on the largest trees in the
   landscape. The role of bark removal in increasing the vulnerability of
   large trees to fire and the mechanism through which fire damage is
   mediated were investigated in Kruger National Park. South Africa, by
   experimentally removing bark and burning Acacia nigrescens stems with
   diameters ranging between 30 and 68 mm. Also, field surveys were
   conducted subsequent to natural fires in order to investigate mortality
   patterns of large trees with dbh greater than 15 cm with bark removed by
   elephants. An increasing probability of mortality was associated with
   increasing amounts of bark removal but only if trees were burned. When
   trees had bark removed but were not burnt, simulating damage only to
   cambium and phloem, none of the 12 treated stems died in the 4-mo period
   over which the experimentran. Moreover, low levels of cambium damage
   were detected in large burned stems. This suggests that bark removal
   increases fire-induced xylem damage and that this damage contributes
   towards stein mortality. In a survey of 437 large trees. bark removal by
   elephants was frequent on large stems (44\%) and larger trees have
   greater amounts of bark removed. Post-fire mortality of large trees was
   significantly associated with increasing bark removal and stem diameter.
   These results indicate that bark removal by elephants increases the
   vulnerability of stems to fire, resulting in mortality of large stems
   otherwise protected from fire.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of interannual variability in temperature and precipitation
   on global terrestrial ecosystems is investigated using a dynamic global
   vegetation model driven by gridded climate observations for the
   twentieth century. Contrasting simulations are driven either by repeated

   cover, particularly over semi-arid regions, and favors the expansion of
   grass cover at the expense of tree cover, due to differences in growth
   rates, fire impacts, and interception. The area burnt by global fires is
   substantially enhanced by interannual precipitation variability. The
   current position of the central United States' ecotone, with forests to
   the east and grasslands to the west, is largely attributed to climate
   variability. Among woody vegetation, climate variability supports
   expanded deciduous forest growth and diminished evergreen forest growth,
   due to difference in bioclimatic limits, leaf longevity, interception
   rates, and rooting depth. These results offer insight into future

Title = {{Do wildfire and slope aspect affect soil water repellency in eucalypt
   plantations? - A two-year high resolution temporal dataset}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire can induce, enhance, or destroy natural soil water repellency
   (SWR) depending mostly on soil burnt severity, soil and vegetation
   types, soil organic matter (SOM) content and type, soil texture, peak
   soil temperature and remaining time and, antecedent soil moisture
   content (SMC). In Portugal, SWR in eucalypt stands has been shown to
   increase surface runoff under dry antecedent SMCs in both burnt and
   unburnt sites, thereby enhancing soil erosion. Despite the many
   hydrological implications of SWR, intensive field monitoring under a
   wide range of SMCs is still limited. This study aimed to improve our
   understanding of the role of slope aspect and wildfire on the temporal
   evolution of SWR in Mediterranean environments, which will be helpful
   for hydrological modelling and post-fire soil erosion risk assessment.
   In this sense, two burnt eucalypt plantations (wildfire of July 2010)
   were selected along a neighbouring, long-unburnt eucalypt stand, in
   north-central Portugal, in order to assess SWR and SMC's in a high
   temporal resolution. During the first two post-fire years, at 1-2 week
   intervals, surface (2.5 cm depth) SWR and SMC were monitored using the
   ``molarity of an ethanol droplet{''} (MED) test and a soil probe,
   respectively. The results showed that the observed annual SWR was very
   high to extreme (80\% of measurements >= 6 ethanol class) for all three
   sites. Wildfire reduced the annual median SWR by one class (extreme to
   very high) for both post-fire years. During prolonged dry periods the
   unburnt site was significantly more repellent (P < 0.01) and less
   spatially variable (P < 0.01) than the recently burnt site, while in the
   wet periods there was no significant difference. After burning, slope
   aspect did not have a strong impact on the annual median SWR class.
   However, the north-west aspect site recorded significantly (p < 0.01)
   greater annual frequencies of extreme repellency than the south-east
   aspect site (70-73\% vs. 51-55\%).}},

Abstract = {{The buttongrass blanket moorlands are a unique habitat that constitutes
   a major landscape feature within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage
   Area (TWWHA) of southwestern Tasmania. They are a highly pyrogenic
   vegetation type that has had a long history of regular burning by
   aborigines. Buttongrass may require a fire frequency of 5-20 years in
   order to maintain its suitability as habitat for many endemic
   vertebrates. The present knowledge of the Acari in the peat/litter
   accumulations in buttongrass is very poor and their response to fire is
   not understood. This study addresses the following questions: (1) How do
   soil mite communities in recently burned buttongrass compare with those
   that have not been burned in several decades? and (2) Are fire
   frequencies of between 5-20 years sufficient for soil mite populations
   to recover? A survey of soil mites was undertaken in a chronosequence of
   age classes of buttongrass at two study areas in the TWWHA. Six
   soil-cores were removed from up to four sites of each age class at
   3-months intervals for 1 year, a total of 870 soil cores. All mature
   mites were identified to morphospecies with many individuals identified
   to genus or species. The soil mite community within buttongrass was
   found to be rich both at family and species level, in Oribatida,
   Prostigmata, and Mesostigmata. This community was significantly affected
   by fire, with a reduced number of species for many years post-fire.
   Density and diversity of these populations are positively correlated
   with age and many communities only changed significantly after 30-40
   years post fire, which is in conflict with the prevailing management
   practice of burning every 5-20 years.}},

   sources, decreasing log(e)-linearly with distance from the source up to
   40 m. The similarity between distances of seed dispersal determined

Abstract = {{Periodic fire is thought to improve whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis
   Engelm.) regeneration by reducing competition and creating openings, but
   the mechanisms by which fire affects seedling establishment are poorly
   understood. I compared seedling vegetation production in adjacent sites,
   one last burned in 1880 and the other in 1988, to test the hypothesis
   that recent fire increases whitebark pine seedling growth. I
   experimentally tested effects of fire on seedling recruitment and growth
   by planting seeds in prescribed burned and nearby unburned sites.
   Experimental results showed nearly three times greater seed germination
   and seedling survival in recently prescribed burn plots. Seedling
   vegetation production in the 1880 and 1988 burn sites were measured
   using stem diameter and number of new needle bundles. Stem diameter was
   approximately 26 \% greater after the more recent fire in the 1988 burn
   site, and new needle bundle production was approximately 40 \% greater
   in this site relative to seedlings in the adjacent site that was last
   burned in 1880. Seedling growth, measured as both above- and
   below-ground biomass, was approximately 57 \% greater in a recently
   prescribed burn site relative to growth in an adjacent site that was
   unburned since 1910. Higher growth rates after prescribed fire
   corresponded with greater soil NO3- and soil-available P concentrations
   relative to unburned controls. However, high N concentrations in leaves
   of seedlings in unburned plots indicated that whitebark pine seedlings
   were not N-limited. Higher P, increased light availability, and earlier
   snowmelt after fire may be important factors in general post-fire
   success of whitebark pine.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal shock is well known to be an important stimulus for the

   Nevertheless, while the overall germination response of different
   species is known to vary, the interaction between seed size and
   germination to a range of thermal-shock temperatures is poorly
   understood. This interaction may be important in regulating post-fire
   plant community establishment, since larger seeds are able to emerge
   from deeper within the soil profile than smaller seeds, and are
   therefore likely to be insulated against high above-ground temperatures
   by a deeper soil covering. In this experiment we examined how
   germination of eight co-occurring Western Australian fire-followers was
   influenced by thermal shock, and whether germination was significantly
   correlated with seed size. We found that small-seeded species not only
   showed enhanced germination at higher temperatures, but that their
   ability to germinate at higher temperatures was also greater than that
   displayed by larger-seeded species. These findings suggest that while
   seed size may be a useful general predictor of post-fire recruitment
   success, under different fire regimes the interaction between seed size,
   maximum seedling emergence depth, and the ability to withstand different
   thermal-shock temperatures is complex and may confound recent predictive

Abstract = {{Mediterranean landscapes comprise a complex mosaic of different habitats
   that vary in the diversity of their floral communities, pollinator
   communities and pollination services. Using the Greek Island of Lesvos
   as a model system, we assess the biodiversity value of six common
   habitats and measure ecosystemic `health' using pollen grain deposition
   in three core flowering plants as a measure of pollination services.
   Three fire-driven habitats were assessed: freshly burnt areas, fully
   regenerated pine forests and intermediate age scrub; in addition we
   examined oak woodlands, actively managed olive groves and groves that
   had been abandoned from agriculture. Oak woodlands, pine forests and
   managed olive groves had the highest diversity of bees. The habitat
   characteristics responsible for structuring bee communities were: floral
   diversity, floral abundance, nectar energy availability and the variety
   of nectar resources present. Pollination services in two of our plant
   species, which were pollinated by a limited sub-set of the pollinator
   community, indicated that pollination levels were highest in the burnt
   and mature pine habitats. The third species, which was open to all
   flower visitors, indicated that oak woodlands had the highest levels of
   pollination from generalist species. Pollination was always more
   effective in managed olive groves than in abandoned groves. However, the
   two most common species of bee, the honeybee and a bumblebee, were not
   the primary pollinators within these habitats. We conclude that the
   three habitats of greatest overall value for plant-pollinator
   communities and provision of the healthiest pollination services are
   pine forests, oak woodland and managed olive groves. We indicate how the
   highest value habitats may be maintained in a complex landscape to
   safeguard and enhance pollination function within these habitats and
   potentially in adjoining agricultural areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper examines the state of knowledge about the effects of
   prescribed burning on surface runoff and erosion at point to catchment
   scales in forests and shrublands. Fires can increase surface runoff and
   erosion by removing vegetation, changing soil hydrologic properties and
   providing a readily erodible layer of sediment and ash. Catchment-scale
   studies in prescribed-burnt areas usually report minimal impacts from
   the burn. However, measurements at smaller spatial scales suggest that
   large changes to hydrologic properties and processes do occur, and a
   debris-flow example from Australia demonstrates that large
   catchment-scale impacts are possible. It appears that existing
   catchment-scale studies in prescribed burns do not capture these large
   events as the sample size (i.e. number of studies) is too small relative
   to the infrequency of such events. Furthermore, numerous knowledge gaps
   across all spatial scales limit understanding of the processes
   contributing to post-prescribed burn runoff and erosion. Understanding
   the influence of fire regime characteristics on post-fire runoff and
   erosion is particularly important in the context of prescribed burning,
   as fire regimes can be manipulated to reduce erosion and water-quality
   impacts. Therefore, two directions for future research are recommended:
   (1) process-based studies to understand the factors controlling surface
   runoff and erosion, particularly in relation to aspects of the fire
   regime; and (2) landscape-scale surveys to quantify large erosion
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is the most important natural disturbance driving vegetation

   sites in different regions and used models to relate post-fire responses
   of 4155 trees from 14 species with fire severity indicators and tree
   characteristics. The influence of several spatiotemporal factors at the
   site level was also considered. Results showed that pine mortality was
   usually high and mainly determined by fire severity, whereas plant
   traits played a minor role. In contrast, mortality of broadleaved trees
   was usually low, even for high-severity fire, but most trees were
   top-killed. Stem mortality increased with fire severity and decreased
   with bark thickness and tree size. The models for predicting individual
   mortality of pines and stem mortality of broadleaves showed very good
   performance, including when validated against independent datasets. Our

Abstract = {{Mediterranean type ecosystems are among the world's most fire-prone

   depend on plant community composition and on the flower, seed, and fruit

Abstract = {{(Fire and dynamics of a woody community in the cerrado of Barra do

   woody vegetation after natural fires in Parque Estadual da Serra Azul
   have shown that fire affects plant survival and growth. The response of
   vegetation to fire depends on intensity, frequency and duration of
   burning. Ten plots (20 x 50 m) (Area 1) were burned in 2002 and 2005.
   Another ten plots (Area 2) were burned in 2002, 2005 and 2007. In
   January 2009, in Area 1, tree mortality was lower (2.0\%) and
   recruitment (3.7\%) higher than that observed Area 2 (4.3\% and 0.05\%
   respectively). Plant mortality decreased with increasing size class. In
   Area 2, there was a reduction in plant size (height and diameter). The
   resprouting pattern after fire was related to plant size. Smaller size
   classes had higher proportions of resprouting at the base of the stem
   while the larger size classes had more resprouts at the tree crown. In
   Area 2, species richness was reduced (estimated by Jacknife and Chao 2).
   Our results suggest that the tolerance of adult trees and smaller plants

Abstract = {{Establishing herbaceous groundcover is essential for oak woodland and
   savanna restoration. In the Appalachian region, woody vegetation in the
   understory can persist through many fires and interfere with achieving
   this goal. Herbicide applications could reduce such vegetation and
   interact with canopy-disturbance and fire to accelerate restoration. In
   stands thinned to woodland (16 m(2) ha(-1), 75\% canopy closure) or
   savanna (5 m(2) ha(-1), 24\% canopy closure) conditions and burned
   biennially in the fall (October) or spring (March), we economically
   applied triclopyr (Garlon 3A) to understory woody plants using foliar
   and cut-surface techniques in the fall between fires. From 2011 to 2013,
   only minor differences in vegetation were observed between areas managed
   with canopy-disturbance and fire (CF) and areas where herbicides were
   also used (CFH). Small-sapling (>= 1.4 m tall, < 7.6 cm DBH) density in
   CF was 2,566 stems ha(-1) greater than CFH in 2012 This difference was
   (1) the only woody control CFH attained beyond CF, (2) only lasted a
   single growing-season because it was mostly fire sensitive species
   top-killed by subsequent fire, and (3) only led to increased herbaceous
   groundcover in savannas burned in the fall. This included the greatest
   reported increase in herbaceous groundcover (graminoid + 18.2\%, forb +
   8.0\%) to be associated with herbicide applications under partial oak
   canopies in the Appalachian region. Expanding herbicide target
   constraints, completely removing undesirable seed-sources, increasing
   triclopyr concentration, exploring tank-mixes, and alternative
   application timing (e.g., prior to canopy disturbance) could improve
   effectiveness; however, fire suppression throughout the Appalachian
   region has increased the dominance of fire-sensitive woody species. Our
   results demonstrate how such composition can reduce the utility of
   herbicides relative to fire during oak woodland and savanna restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Forest encroachment into savanna is occurring at an unprecedented rate
   across tropical Africa, leading to a loss of valuable savanna habitat.
   One of the first stages of forest encroachment is the establishment of
   tree seedlings at the forest-savanna transition. This study examines the
   demographic bottleneck in the seedlings of five species of tropical
   forest pioneer trees in a forest-savanna transition zone in West Africa.
   Five species of tropical pioneer forest tree seedlings were planted in
   savanna, mixed/transition, and forest vegetation types and grown for 12
   months, during which time fire occurred in the area. We examined
   seedling survival rates, height, and stem diameter before and after
   fire; and seedling biomass and starch allocation patterns after fire.
   Seedling survival rates were significantly affected by fire, drought,
   and vegetation type. Seedlings that preferentially allocated more
   resources to increasing root and leaf starch (starch storage helps
   recovery from fire) survived better in savanna environments (frequently
   burnt), while seedlings that allocated more resources to growth and
   resource-capture traits (height, the number of leaves, stem diameter,
   specific leaf area, specific root length, root-to-shoot ratio) survived
   better in mixed/transition and forest environments. Larger (taller with
   a greater stem diameter) seedlings survived burning better than smaller
   seedlings. However, larger seedlings survived better than smaller ones
   even in the absence of fire. Bombax buonopozense was the forest species
   that survived best in the savanna environment, likely as a result of
   increased access to light allowing greater investment in belowground
   starch storage capacity and therefore a greater ability to cope with
   fire. Synthesis: Forest pioneer tree species survived best through fire
   and drought in the savanna compared to the other two vegetation types.
   This was likely a result of the open-canopied savanna providing greater
   access to light, thereby releasing seedlings from light limitation and
   enabling them to make and store more starch. Fire can be used as a
   management tool for controlling forest encroachment into savanna as it
   significantly affects seedling survival. However, if rainfall increases
   as a result of global change factors, encroachment may be more difficult
   to control as seedling survival ostensibly increases when the pressure
   of drought is lifted. We propose B. buonopozense as an indicator species
   for forest encroachment into savanna in West African forest-savanna
   transitions.}},

   significance of linear correlations among the number and height of
   seedlings and understorey vegetation cover was tested by calculating
   Pearson correlation coefficients. Seed germination and seedling
   emergence took place massively during the first year after the fire and
   decreased through time. The height growth was constant over the 3 years

   at sites S1 and S2. Also, pines from site S2 reached shorter maximum
   heights in all years compared to pines from site S1 and S3. The
   understorey vegetation showed minimal regeneration during the first year
   but then increased greatly with time. Woody understorey cover and total
   vegetation cover were negatively correlated with pine seedling density
   in sites with a high number of seedlings (e.g. S1 and S3). When woody
   cover, total cover and pine seedling density were low (e.g. S2), there
   were no correlations. There was a positive correlation between

Abstract = {{Following wildfire, mountainous areas of the western United States are
   susceptible to debris flow during intense rainfall. Convective storms
   that can generate debris flows in recently burned areas may occur during
   or immediately after the wildfire, leaving insufficient time for

   a method for estimating post-fire debris-flow hazards before wildfire
   using historical data to define the range of potential fire severities
   for a given location based on the statistical distribution of severity
   metrics obtained from remote sensing. Estimates of debris-flow
   likelihood, magnitude and triggering rainfall threshold based on the
   statistically simulated fire severity data provide hazard predictions
   consistent with those calculated from fire severity data collected after
   wildfire. Simulated fire severity data also produce hazard estimates
   that replicate observed debris-flow occurrence, rainfall conditions and
   magnitude at a monitored site in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern
   California. Future applications of this method should rely on a range of
   potential fire severity scenarios for improved pre-fire estimates of

   modelling other post-fire hazards, such as flooding and erosion risk,

Abstract = {{Questions Ants and rodents are recognized as ecosystem engineers
   worldwide creating soil-modified nests and adjacent edges with superior
   resources. The influence of Dipodomys spectabilis (rat) and Pogonomyrmex
   rugosus (ant) on nests and edges would be similar in burned and unburned
   habitat on functional groups' cover, density, number of inflorescences
   and species number. We hypothesize that annual and perennial dicots
   would recover faster on rat patches than on burned grassland, dicots and
   grasses would recover faster on ant patches than on burned grassland,
   and annual dicots would recover faster on rat than on ant patches,
   whereas grasses would recover faster on ant than on rat patches.
   Location Semiarid grassland, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New
   Mexico, USA. Methods We analyzed annual and perennial dicots, grasses
   and subshrubs in burned and unburned plots at 80 nests during cool- and
   warm-seasons two years post-fire. Data were collected at nest top
   (mound), edge, and 20 m (control) from the edge. Results Cover, density
   and species richness of different functional groups were low on animal
   mounds in unburned and burned plots. Ant edges had greater perennial
   dicot cover, grass cover and richness while rat edges had lower grass
   density and richness than control sites at unburned and burned plots.
   Perennial dicot density and richness recovered faster at rat mounds and
   edges than control. Ant edges yielded faster recovery of grass
   inflorescences than control. Dicots recovered faster on rat than ant
   mounds whereas grasses grew faster on ant edges. Conclusions Rats create
   nests enhancing density of recovering dicots and ant edges facilitate
   reproduction of recovering grasses. Equal regeneration between animal
   nests and grassland occurred commonly when fire reduced grass
   competition. Dysochory, granivory and fire intensity may influence
   recovery. Nests may be sources of reestablishment and seed dispersal.
   Recovery of grassland may be amplified as plants infill from engineered
   nests.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is produced by the thermal decomposition of
   organic matter in the absence of oxygen (O). PyC affects nutrient
   availability, may enhance post-fire nitrogen (N) mineralization rates,
   and can be a significant carbon (C) pool in fire-prone ecosystems. Our
   objectives were to characterize PyC produced by wildfires and examine
   the influence that contrasting types of PyC have on C and N
   mineralization rates. We determined C, N, O, and hydrogen (H)
   concentrations and atomic ratios of charred bark (BK), charred pine
   cones (PC), and charred woody debris (WD) using elemental analysis. We
   also incubated soil amended with BK, PC, and WD at two concentrations
   for 60 days to measure C and N mineralization rates. PC had greater H/C
   and O/C ratios than BK and WD, suggesting that PC may have a lesser
   aromatic component than BK and WD. C and N mineralization rates
   decreased with increasing PyC concentrations, and control samples
   produced more CO2 than soils amended with PyC. Soils with PC produced
   greater CO2 and had lower N mineralization rates than soils with BK or
   WD. These results demonstrate that PyC type and concentration have
   potential to impact nutrient dynamics and C flux to the atmosphere in
   post-fire forest soils.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, dendrochronology was used to reconstruct the fire history
   and associated dynamics of the last 350 years in three larch (Larix
   laricina {[}Du Roi] K. Koch) woodlands in string fens of the northern
   boreal forest of Quebec. Fire scars were also sampled to reconstruct the
   fire history across the surrounding uplands. Our results show that
   string fens are more likely to experience partial disturbance than
   complete removal of the tree cover during fire. Although large fires
   burned across the studied landscape in 1733, 1787, 1865, and 1941, no
   stand-replacing fire has occurred in any of the studied woodlands. At
   all sites, the oldest larch trees became established around 1640-1680,
   and several individuals survived each fire identified across the
   uplands. However, partial disturbance during the most recent 1941 fire,
   which was associated with severe fire weather, decreased tree density
   and released the growth of several trees. Although signs of previous
   fire may have been lost through wood decay, no fire impacted larch
   growth as severely as the 1941 fire, further emphasizing the modest
   influence of fire in string fens as compared with uplands. The low fire
   influence in these minerotrophic peatlands helps explain the high
   occurrence of the fire-sensitive eastern larch.}},

Title = {{Flammability thresholds or flammability gradients? Determinants of fire
   across savanna-forest transitions}},
Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation-fire feedbacks are important for determining the distribution
   of forest and savanna. To understand how vegetation structure controls
   these feedbacks, we quantified flammability across gradients of tree
   density from grassland to forest in the Brazilian Cerrado. We
   experimentally burned 102 plots, for which we measured vegetation
   structure, fuels, microclimate, ignition success and fire behavior. Tree
   density had strong negative effects on ignition success, rate of spread,
   fire-line intensity and flame height. Declining grass biomass was the
   principal cause of this decline in flammability as tree density
   increased, but increasing fuel moisture contributed. Although the
   response of flammability to tree cover often is portrayed as an abrupt,
   largely invariant threshold, we found the response to be gradual, with
   considerable variability driven largely by temporal changes in
   atmospheric humidity. Even when accounting for humidity, flammability at
   intermediate tree densities cannot be predicted reliably. Fire spread in
   savanna-forest mosaics is not as deterministic as often assumed, but may
   appear so where vegetation boundaries are already sharp. Where
   transitions are diffuse, fire spread is difficult to predict, but should
   become increasingly predictable over multiple fire cycles, as boundaries
   are progressively sharpened until flammability appears to respond in a
   threshold-like manner.}},

   recorded channel responses over 13 years at two headwater wetlands lying
   within watersheds that were severely burned by the Rodeo-Chediski
   wildfire (Arizona, U.S.) in 2002. One site, Turkey Spring, was left
   largely untreated for 11 years following the fire, while the second
   site, Swamp Spring, was treated in 2005 by placing large rock riffle
   formations and vegetation transplants to prevent further incision and
   stimulate wetland development. The treatment was soon followed by
   cessation of channel incision and reestablishment of native wetland
   vegetation, while headcutting caused extensive erosion at the untreated
   site for eight years. Radio-carbon dating indicated that the eroding

   demonstrates that headwater wetlands in this region are vulnerable to

Abstract = {{Firefighters can be exposed to a complex set of contaminants while at a

   particularly relating to toxicity is essential to determine the
   effectiveness of intervention techniques to reduce exposure. This study
   investigated the use of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) CALUX
   (R) bioassay for the assessment of exposure and associated toxicity
   firefighters might encounter. This was done through analysis of extracts
   of dermal wipes and urine samples collected from firefighters before and
   after a controlled fire. An increased bioassay response was observed
   from post-fire neck and calf samples, indicating a greater concentration
   of PAH-like compounds on the skin. The use of a baby wipe to clean the
   face and neck during rehab resulted in the attenuation of the observed
   bioassay response from the neck post-fire. Though a correlation was
   observed between the bioassay response and hydroxylated PAH
   concentrations found in the urine, the increased bioassay response from
   the post-fire urine samples was likely due to unknown compounds other
   than the hydroxylated PAHs tested. Our results suggest that this
   bioassay provides a useful measure of firefighter exposure, particularly
   relating to the potential toxicity of contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires in conifer forests create patchy, heterogeneous landscapes.
   For many animal species, this post-fire variability means having to
   navigate quite different habitat patches to locate adequate cover and
   food. For snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777), post-fire
   landscapes could include risky open patches, as well as dense
   regenerating stands rich in food and cover. We analyzed snowshoe hare
   tortuosity, speed of movement, and amount of browse along winter
   foraging pathways in unburned mature forest and in dense regenerating
   stands or open areas with sparse regeneration 12-13 years after the
   Okanagan Mountain Park fire (>25 000 ha near Kelowna, British Columbia,
   Canada) to determine whether hares change foraging behaviour in relation
   to cover type. Hares moved the fastest and browsed the least in open
   habitats. Hares browsed most often in areas where sapling regeneration
   was dense; their main forage was lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas
   ex Loudon). No differences were found in pathway tortuosity in relation
   to cover type (open, regenerating, or mature patches). When hares moved
   slower along foraging pathways, they also moved slightly more tortuously
   and ate more. These results suggest that hares prefer post-fire areas
   with dense tree regeneration.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{205-213}},
Abstract = {{Given the observed heterogeneity in fire severity produced within
   wildfires, we asked to what extent this heterogeneity might affect
   post-fire regeneration. For this purpose, we studied the post-fire
   dynamics of Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) in the eastern Iberian
   Peninsula. Sampling was stratified on the basis of fire severity. We
   defined three fire severity classes based on the degree of consumption
   of the pine canopy. The results suggested that there is no clear
   relationship between seedling density and fire severity; however,
   mortality was lower and growth ( height, shoot biomass and root biomass)
   was higher in the high severity class. These results can be explained by
   soil processes: Sites in the high fire severity class may have sustained
   higher fire intensities, resulting in higher soil organic matter
   mineralisation and higher ash deposition, and thus in higher post-fire
   soil fertility. This higher fertility would produce faster growth in
   pine seedlings. Independent of the severity class, seedling mortality
   was higher in quadrats ( 50 x 50 cm) with higher cover of the perennial
   grass Brachypodium retusum ( Poaceae), suggesting a possible competitive
   effect. For all plots in all 3 severity classes, spatial analysis
   suggests an aggregate seedlings pattern, but with independence from the

Abstract = {{Annually emerging cicadas are a numerically and ecologically dominant
   species in Southwestern riparian forests. Humans have altered
   disturbance regimes that structure these forests such that floods are
   less common and wildfires occur more frequently than was historically
   the case. Impacts of these changes on primary consumers such as riparian
   cicadas are unknown. Because cicadas are consumed by a variety of animal
   species, disturbances that alter timing of their emergence or abundance
   could have consequences for species at higher trophic levels. We trapped
   emerging cicadas (Tibicen dealbatus) in burned and unburned riparian
   forest plots along the Middle Rio Grande in central New Mexico (USA) to
   determine effects of wildfire and vegetation structure on their density
   and phenology. We measured vegetation variables and soil temperature at
   cicada traps and related these variables to variation in emergence
   density and phenology. We also experimentally heated soil under
   emergence traps to examine the relationship between soil temperature and
   emergence phenology. Emergence density was similar in wildfire and
   unburned plots, though emergence date averaged earlier in wildfire plots
   and experimentally heated traps. We identified models containing
   cottonwood proximity (distance from the nearest cottonwood tree) and
   cottonwood canopy coverage as the most parsimonious explanations of
   emergence density at each trap. Model selection results were consistent
   with the literature and field observations that showed that cottonwood
   trees are an essential resource for T. dealbatus. Cottonwood canopy was
   also correlated with low soil temperatures, which are associated with
   later emergence dates. Failure of cottonwoods to reestablish following
   wildfire could result in cicadas emerging at lower densities and at
   earlier dates., For cicadas to emerge at densities and times that
   provide the greatest benefits to birds and other riparian-obligate
   secondary consumers, riparian forests should be protected from fire, and
   native vegetation in wildfire sites should be restored.}},

Abstract = {{Increased fire frequency has been shown to promote alien plant invasions
   in the western United States, resulting in persistent vegetation type
   change. Short interval fires are widely considered to be detrimental to
   reestablishment of shrub species in southern California chaparral,
   facilitating the invasion of exotic annuals and producing ``type
   conversion{''}. However, supporting evidence for type conversion has
   largely been at local, site scales and over short post-fire time scales.
   Type conversion has not been shown to be persistent or widespread in
   chaparral, and past range improvement studies present evidence that
   chaparral type conversion may be difficult and a relatively rare
   phenomenon across the landscape. With the aid of remote sensing data
   covering coastal southern California and a historical wildfire dataset,
   the effects of short interval fires (<8 years) on chaparral recovery
   were evaluated by comparing areas that burned twice to adjacent areas
   burned only once. Twelve pairs of once- and twice-burned areas were
   compared using normalized burn ratio (NBR) distributions. Correlations
   between measures of recovery and explanatory factors (fire history,
   climate and elevation) were analyzed by linear regression. Reduced
   vegetation cover was found in some lower elevation areas that were
   burned twice in short interval fires, where non-sprouting species are
   more common. However, extensive type conversion of chaparral to
   grassland was not evident in this study. Most variables, with the
   exception of elevation, were moderately or poorly correlated with
   differences in vegetation recovery.}},

   Index field plots and spectral indices from four satellite sensors
   varying in spatial and spectral resolution on the 2003 Dry Lakes Fire in

Abstract = {{Background: Research on herbaceous vegetation restoration in forests

   a dominant fern understorey is lacking. Most of the plant diversity
   found in Eastern hardwood forests in the United States is found in the
   herbaceous understorey layer. Loss of forest herbaceous species is an
   indicator of declining forest conditions.
   Aims: The combined effects of deer herbivory, competitive understorey
   vegetation removal, and overstorey tree removal on the abundance and
   reproductive capacity of three understorey herbs in the Liliaceae family
   were evaluated.
   Methods: A split-plot randomised block design was used with three
   replicates. Treatments included three harvest intensities,
   fenced/unfenced, herbicide/no herbicide-treated, prescribed burn/no
   prescribed burn, and all combinations. A generalised linear model was
   used to compare treatment effects over 8 years.
   Results: Both fruit production and cover increased significantly in
   fenced areas for all three species. There was a significant 6-year
   recovery period for cover of the three species in response to herbicide.
   There was a significant 4-year recovery period of fire-treated plots for
   fruit production of the three species. The most intensively cut, fenced,
   and herbicide-treated plots had the greatest increases in sapling and
   Rubus spp. cover. Cover and fruit production of the three herbs were
   significantly greatest in the moderate-cut treatment.
   Conclusions: Restoration of these three liliaceous species is most
   likely to occur in Eastern deciduous forests and similar forests using a
   combined fenced and moderate-cut treatment.}},

Abstract = {{A study on population density, structure, distribution and early growth
   characteristics of Tarchonanthus camphoratus was carried out on a
   Tarchonanthus-dominated woodland. A line plot transect 4 km in length
   was laid out in a woodland along the altitudinal gradient capturing most
   of the observed vegetation variation. In total 34, 20 x 20 m plots were
   evaluated for their horizontal population structure and species
   composition. In addition, six more plots dominated by Tarchonanthus were
   monitored for coppice and shoot development for a period of 8 months.
   Understanding of growth and population characteristics of the dominant
   species in woodland is necessary for its effective management. Results
   indicate that the woodland can be delineated into three distinct stands
   by using cluster analysis based on location and composition. The
   diameter size class distribution of the woodland follows a reverse J
   curve, which indicate a normal uneven-aged forest. Tarchonanthus
   camphoratus has a high regenerative power after cutting or burning,
   which indicates its high potential for sustainable management. It was
   concluded that the woodland could be stratified into distinct stands for
   management. Permanent sample plots should be established to determine
   the sustained yield, as size-class distribution alone is insufficient. A
   management and utilization schedule based on distinct stands is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we compare and contrast vegetation development following
   natural and logging disturbances in a major boreal river valley.
   Permanent sample plots and releves were established and sampled for
   vegetation and landscape attributes in June and July of 1993 and 1994 in
   the Peace River Lowlands, Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. In the
   Peace River Lowlands, primary succession is a flood-origin process,
   Secondary succession may be either autogenic through gap dynamics
   mediated by nursery logs, buried wood, and suckering, or allogenic,
   following fire or logging. Flood origin accounts for 72\% and fire
   origin for 29\% of the undisturbed forests. From 1951-1995, 24\% of the
   forest land burned, yielding a fire return interval of 186 years. Forest
   successional trajectories are set soon after flood, logging, or fire,
   with little evidence of gradual replacement of one forest type by
   another. Vegetation composition and relative species abundance are
   strongly correlated with living moss depth, moss-lichen total cover,
   total tree cover, herb cover, and canopy height. Species with high
   indicator value are Hylocomium splendens, Picea glauca, Pyrola
   chlorantha, Equisetum pratense, and Epilobium angustifolium. Strong
   correlations exist between white spruce tree density and canopy height,
   total tree cover and canopy height, total tree cover and basal area per
   hectare, basal area and canopy height, and between canopy height and
   surface age. Clearcuts are initially dominated by rose-raspberry
   followed by balsam poplar (with lesser amounts of Alaska birch and
   aspen). After logging, temporal changes in composition and dominance
   occur more rapidly than during natural succession. There is no evidence
   of post-logging convergence toward the original white spruce and
   mixedwood forests; a long-term deciduous disclimax is predicted.
   Vegetation associations, successional pathways, landscape relationships,
   and ecological benchmarks are identified.}},

Abstract = {{A principal challenge to restoring tree-invaded grasslands is the
   removal of woody biomass. Burning of slash piles to reduce woody
   residues from forest restoration practices generates intense, prolonged
   heating, with adverse effects on soils and vegetation. In this study, we
   examined vegetation responses to pile burning following tree removal
   from conifer-invaded grasslands of the Oregon Cascades. We quantified
   the longevity and magnitude of fire effects by comparing ground
   conditions and the cover and richness of plant species in burn-scar
   centers (higher-intensity fire) and edges (lower-intensity fire) with
   adjacent unburned vegetation 7 years after treatment. We interpreted
   patterns of recovery through the responses of species with differing
   growth forms, habitat affinities, and clonality. Cover of bare ground
   remained elevated at the centers, but not at the edges of scars;
   however, much of this effect was due to gopher disturbance. Total plant
   cover, consisting entirely of native species, was comparable in and
   adjacent to scars. However, richness remained depressed at the scar
   centers. Cover of grass, meadow, and non-clonal species was comparable
   in and adjacent to scars, but cover of forb, sedge, residual forest, and
   clonal species was reduced at the centers. Although scar centers had a
   simpler community structure (fewer but more abundant species) than the
   adjacent vegetation, they remained free of exotics and recovered
   quickly, aided by the soil-disturbing activities of gophers and the
   regenerative traits of native, disturbance-adapted species. Pile burning
   can be a viable and efficient approach to fuel reduction in the absence
   of exotics.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{In Western Mediterranean areas, fires are frequent in forests
   established on old croplands where woody resprouting species are scarce
   and post-fire regeneration is limited to obligate-seeder species, such
   as Mediterranean gorse (Ulex parviflorus), that accumulate a great deal
   of fine dry fuel, increasing the risk of other severe fires. Under these
   conditions, fuel control techniques are required in order to prevent
   fires of high intensity and severity and the subsequent economic and
   ecological damage. Prescribed fires present an alternative to fuel
   control, and recent studies demonstrate that, under optimum climatic
   conditions, fire-line intensity values fall within the limits of those
   recommended for fire prescription. However, a better understanding of
   the consequences of fire on the regeneration of vegetation is needed in
   order to evaluate the suitability of prescribed fires as a technique for
   fuel reduction in Mediterranean gorse ecosystems. This paper analyses
   the factors controlling seedling germination after fire to make an
   evaluation from ail ecological perspective of whether fire prescription
   is a suitable technique for fuel control in mature Mediterranean gorse
   shrublands. The results show that small differences in the composition
   of vegetation play a decisive role in fire behaviour, and have a
   decisive influence oil the system's capacity for regeneration. Fire
   severity is low in mixed Mediterranean gorse communities with a low
   continuity of dead fine fuel (including Cistus sp., Rosmarinus sp.,
   etc.) and fire creates a wide range of microhabitats where seedling
   emergence is high. In contrast, where U. parviflorus is more dominant,
   fire severity is higher and the regeneration of vegetation could be
   hindered. Our conclusions suggest that detailed studies of the
   composition of plant communities are required in order to decide whether
   prescribed burning should be applied. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Post-fire flooding and elevated sediment loads in channels can pose
   hazards to people and structures within the wildland-urban interface.
   Mitigation of these hazards is essential to protect downstream
   resources. Straw bale check dams are one treatment designed to reduce
   sediment yields in small ephemeral catchments (<2 ha). This study
   investigated their effectiveness in five paired catchments burned at
   high severity during the 2010 Twitchell Canyon Fire in Utah. Rainfall,
   ground cover and hillslope erosion rates were also measured during the
   two-year study. Adjacent paired catchments were physically similar and
   ranged in size from 0.2 to 1.6 ha across pairs. Within pairs, one
   catchment was an untreated control and the other treated at a rate of
   four straw bale check dams ha(-1). High intensity rainfall, erodible
   soils and slow regrowth contributed to the observed high hillslope
   sediment yields (> 60 Mg ha(-1)). 1- and 2-yr I-30 return period rain
   events early in the study quickly filled the straw bale check dams
   indicating the treatment did not statistically reduce annual sediment
   yields. First year annual sediment yields across all catchments were
   19.6 to 25.7 Mg ha(-1). Once the check dams were full, they had limited
   storage capacity during the second post-fire year, allowing 3.8 to 13.1
   Mg ha(-1) of sediment to pass over the check dams. The mean mass of
   sediment trapped by individual straw bale check dams was 13 Mg, which
   allowed them to trap a mean of 5.9 Mg ha(-1) of sediment at the given
   treatment rate. Straw bale check dams trapped <50\% of the total mass
   delivered from catchments with efficiency decreasing over time.
   Increasing straw bale check dam treatment rate in stable channels may
   improve trap efficiency. Application of this treatment in areas with
   lower expected rainfall intensities and less erodible soils may be
   justifiable. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Revisitation studies enable long-term changes in vegetation to be
   deciphered and insights into plant community succession to be gained.
   This is particularly important when assessing the effects of fire
   exclusion in ecosystems where fire is thought to have once been common.
   Using two adjacent coastal Banksia integrifolia forest stands in
   southern Victoria, Australia initially surveyed in 1975 by Hazard and
   Parsons, we document the changes that occurred in the stand structure
   between 1975 and 2000. Western Park (WP) has now remained unburnt for
   over 100 years while Cerberus Naval Base (CNB) was most recently burnt
   in 1942. Banksia integrifolia densities have decreased at both sites
   over the 25-years period by an average of 42-77\%, as have other coastal
   native shrubs (e.g. Leptospermum laevigatum, Leucopogon parviflorus).
   Trees at WP appear to have died due to old age while mortality at CNB is
   presumed to be due to stand thinning in response to intense competition
   for light. Successful recruitment by Banksia has been minimal; trees
   less than 9 cm girth over bark at breast height (GBBH) were absent at
   CNB while no trees < 19 cm GBBH were observed at WP. The long-term
   absence of disturbance such as fire is suspected to be one of the causes
   of regeneration failure of the stand at WP. Gap phase regeneration is
   not apparent in B. integrifolia and hence, long-term succession to a
   more grassy community is likely when fire is excluded for long periods.}},

Abstract = {{Fires may greatly alter the N budget of a plant community. During. re
   nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere. Although high light availability
   after fire promotes N-2-fixation, the presumably high soil N
   availability could limit N-2-fixation activity. The latter limitation
   might be particularly acute in legume seedlings compared with resprouts,
   which have immediate access to belowground stored carbon. We wished to
   learn whether early post-fire conditions were conducive to N-2-fixation
   in leguminous seedlings and resprouts in two types of grassland and in a
   shrubland and whether seedlings and resprouts incurred different amounts
   of N-2-fixation after fire. We set 18 experimental. res in early autumn
   on 6 plots, subsequently labelling 6 subplots (2 x 2 m(2)) in each
   community with (NH4+)-N-15- N ( 99 atom \% excess). For 9 post-fire
   months we measured net N mineralisation in the top 5 cm of soil and we
   calculated the fraction of legume N derived from the atmosphere (\%
   Ndfa) in seedlings and resprouts. We used two independent estimates of
   the amounts of N derived from non-atmospheric sources in potentially
   N-2-fixing plants: mean soil pool abundance and the N-15-enrichment of
   non-legumes. Despite substantial soil net N mineralisation in all burned
   community types ( about 2.6 g Nm(-2) during the first nine months after
   fire), the \% Ndfa of various legume species was 52 - 99\%. Legumes from
   both grasslands showed slightly higher N-2-fixation values than
   shrubland legumes. As grassland legumes grew in more belowground dense
   communities than shrubland legumes, we suggest that higher competition
   for soil resources in well established grass-resprouting communities may
   enhance the rate of N-2-fixation after fire. In contrast to our
   hypothesis, legume seedlings and resprouts from the three plant
   communities studied, had similar \% Ndfa and apparently acquired most of
   their N from the atmosphere rather than from the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Current conditions in dry forests of the western United State have given
   rise to policy mandates for accelerated ecological restoration on U.S.
   National Forest System and other public lands. In southwestern ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests, mechanized tree thinning and
   prescribed fire are common restoration treatments but are not acceptable
   for all sites. Currently there is much interest in managing naturally
   ignited fires to accomplish restoration objectives but few studies have
   systematically examined the efficacy of such ``resource objective{''}
   wildfires for restoring historical ranges of variability (HRV). In this
   study we used field plots to retrospectively sample 10 resource
   objective fires on two national forests in northern Arizona. We used
   four burn severity classes identified on Monitoring Trends in Burn
   Severity (MTBS) maps to stratify field sampling and compared post-fire
   means for 12 structure and hazardous fuels attributes to HRV and
   guidelines for ecosystem management. Results indicated significant
   differences among burn severity classes in tree density, basal area,
   coarse wood loads, canopy cover, and canopy fuel loads. Furthermore,
   areas classified as moderate (M) burn severity met HRV ranges for more
   attributes (67\%) than did other areas in other severity classes. High
   (H) severity areas were within HRV for the fewest (17\%) of the 12
   attributes. Restoration ranges for large snag density, tree patch
   density and maximum patch size, and tree diameter distribution were not
   met within any burn severity class. Resource objective fire landscapes
   were comprised mainly (85\%) of areas classified as unburned/low (U/L)
   and low (L) burn severity, whereas the M severity class made up just
   12\% of fire landscapes on average. Overall effectiveness of resource
   objective fires for meeting restoration objectives was 42\%. Results
   suggested that effectiveness may be increased by managing for
   proportionally more moderate burn severity on these landscapes. For
   this, managers will be required to accept greater risk in terms of
   escaped fires and high-severity fire, which, in turn, will necessitate
   increasing public awareness of the potential benefits and limitations of
   managing wildfires for restoring ponderosa pine forest ecosystems. (C)

Abstract = {{Semi-natural habitats such as heathlands, are important for the
   conservation of biodiversity. Due to a significant decline in
   traditional management, e.g. burning and grazing, in combination with
   habitat loss, these ecosystems have become highly threatened. On the
   other hand, human activities create modern infrastructures, e.g.
   power-line corridors (PLCs), and they can function as an alternative
   habitat for species for which their semi-natural habitat has degraded.
   This study compared the species richness and species composition of
   carabid beetles and wolf spiders in PLCs, traditionally managed
   heathlands and former heathlands that are covered with coniferous
   forests. We also measured vegetation variables and used it to compare
   species richness of plant, abundances of species and Ellenberg indicator
   values in the different habitats. The results showed that species
   richness of carabid beetles in the traditionally managed heathland is
   significantly higher compared to the PLCs. The species composition of
   carabid beetles and wolf spiders were also significantly different in
   these two habitats, but there was no difference between the species
   composition of carabid beetles and wolf spiders in the PLCs and forests.
   This might be explained by the similar vegetation structure in the PLCs
   and the forests, such as the high abundance of trees and shrubs and low
   abundance of typical heathland plants. Our results showed that PLCs are
   not an alternative habitat for the carabid beetle and wolf spider
   heathland specialists. We discussed how the management could be changed

Abstract = {{1. Callitris intratropica is a long-lived, obligate-seeding,
   fire-sensitive overstorey conifer that typically occurs in small groves
   (<0.1 ha) of much higher tree densities than the surrounding,
   eucalypt-dominated tropical savanna in northern Australia. We used C.
   intratropica groves of varying canopy cover to examine the role of
   feedbacks between fire and tree cover in the persistence of a
   fire-sensitive tree species and the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity
   in a highly flammable savanna. 2. We examined the population structure
   and floristic composition of C. intratropica groves and conducted
   controlled burns with Aboriginal landowners to test the prediction that
   groves of C. intratropica with closed canopies inhibit savanna fires by
   physically altering the fuel arrays below trees. We measured pre- and
   post-burn fuel availability, the probability of burning and fire
   intensity along transects (5575 m) spanning entire C. intratropica
   groves and extending into the surrounding savanna matrix. 3. We found
   that closed-canopy groves of C. intratropica had higher densities of
   seedlings and saplings than open-canopy groves and supported a distinct
   plant community. Closed-canopy groves also had a lower probability of
   burning and less severe fires due to a lower availability of fine fuels
   than the surrounding savanna. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the
   observed regeneration within closed-canopy C. intratropica groves within
   frequently burnt savanna reflects a vegetationfire feedback. A
   significant, negative relationship between canopy cover and the
   probability of burning provides strong evidence that closed-canopy C.
   intratropica groves are capable of excluding low-intensity savanna
   fires, thereby enabling the persistence of patches of fire-sensitive
   forest or woodland amid open, highly flammable savanna vegetation. We
   present our findings as evidence that alternative stable state dynamics
   may play a role in determining savanna diversity and structure.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire can influence a variety of stream ecosystem properties. We
   studied stream temperatures in relation to wildfire in small streams in
   the Boise River Basin, located in central Idaho, USA. To examine the
   spatio-temporal aspects of temperature in relation to wildfire, we
   employed three approaches: a pre-post fire comparison of temperatures
   between two sites (one from a burned stream and one unburned) over 13
   years, a short-term (3 year) pre-post fire comparison of a burned and
   unburned stream with spatially extensive data, and a short-term (1 year)
   comparative study of spatial variability in temperatures using a ``space
   for time{''} substitutive design across 90 sites in nine streams
   (retrospective comparative study). The latter design included streams
   with a history of stand-replacing wildfire and streams with severe
   post-fire reorganization of channels due to debris flows and flooding.
   Results from these three studies indicated that summer maximum water
   temperatures can remain significantly elevated for at least a decade
   following wildfire, particularly in streams with severe channel
   reorganization. In the retrospective comparative study we investigated
   occurrence of native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and tailed frog
   larvae (Ascaphus montanus) in relation to maximum stream temperatures
   during summer. Both occurred in nearly every site sampled, but tailed
   frog larvae were found in much warmer water than previously reported in
   the field (26.6 degrees C maximum summer temperature). Our results show
   that physical stream habitats can remain altered (for example, increased
   temperature) for many years following wildfire, but that native aquatic
   vertebrates can be resilient. In a management context, this suggests
   wildfire may be less of a threat to native species than human influences
   that alter the capacity of stream-living vertebrates to persist in the
   face of natural disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The Cabrera vole is an endangered species frequently found in the

   assumed that regular burning is not very prejudicial to this vole, the
   impact of fire is unknown. This research studied, for the first time,
   recolonisation by the Cabrera vole after wildfire. Colonies were
   monitored over one year after a wildfire and the most relevant
   ecological features in their reestablishment were identified. During the
   first eight months, all the 18 surveyed colonies remained unoccupied.
   However, after one year, 11 were recolonised. Vegetation structure and
   composition in the colonies ( vegetation height, plant families
   diversity, percentage of bare ground and cover of shrubs before the
   fire), which are important features in offering protection and
   nutrition, were closely related to reoccupation of the colonies.
   Surprisingly, fire intensity did not influence recolonisation. Distance
   from unburned areas proved to be a factor that delayed recolonisation.
   The importance of the montado for this species was reinforced by the
   evidence that recolonisation occurred preferentially in colonies

   burning efficiency factors were applied considering severity levels.
   Post-fire biomass was then transformed into CO2 emissions (426,754.8

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{415}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is a widely used ecosystem management approach and the
   vast majority of burns are conducted during the dormant season; however,
   these burning conditions (and therefore the type and persistence of fire
   effects) often differ from those of natural or historical fire regimes.
   Therefore, we leveraged a historical study (conducted 1959-70) with
   remeasurements in 2015 to evaluate effects of fire season (dormant,
   summer), frequency (annual, biennial, periodic), and their interaction
   on soil physical and chemical properties in a red pine (Pinus maltose
   Ait.) forest in northern Minnesota, USA. To protect against across-year
   differences in sampling and analysis, we used a meta-analysis approach
   to evaluate treatment effects on soil properties. We also used
   non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination to investigate
   legacy (> 45 years post-fire) treatment effects.
   The greatest effects of fire occurred in organic horizons, and decreased
   with depth. In the short-term, fire decreased organic horizon depths and
   nitrogen (N) and increased base cations (K, Ca, Mg) and pH in the
   mineral soil, whereas effects on phosphorus (P) were variable.
   Prescribed fire treatments had legacy effects on organic horizon and
   mineral soil properties > 45 years post-fire. In general, summer burns
   decreased nutrient stocks, whereas dormant season burns increased
   nutrient stocks, and the majority of legacy effects occurred in annual
   burn treatments, in both seasons. Legacy effects of summer burns
   decreased organic horizon depths, organic matter, nutrient stocks (N, P,
   K), and pH, as well as lower (0-15 cm) mineral soil N; whereas, the
   dormant annual burn increased Ca in the total forest floor and N and P
   in the upper (15-91 cm) mineral soil. In contrast, the summer annual
   burn increased P, whereas the dormant annual burn decreased pH in the
   lower mineral soil. Trends in short- and long-term effect sizes appeared
   to differ by season of burning and further magnified by increased fire
   frequency within season. Relative to dormant season burns, summer burns
   resulted in immediate and long-lasting desirable effects for red pine
   ecosystems (e.g., decreased forest floor depths and nutrient stocks)
   without persistent undesirable effects (e.g., increased nutrient stocks
   or changes in cation exchange capacity, soil texture, and bulk density)
   in the mineral soil. Our results suggest that summer burns may be a
   valuable approach to increase the variability in burn schedules
   representative of historical regional fire regimes in red pine forests,
   and may help promote soil characteristics that support overall ecosystem
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook. vat occidentalis) has been
   expanding into sagebrush (Artemisia L. spp.) steppe over the past 130 yr
   in Idaho, Oregon, and California. Fuel characteristics and expected fire
   behavior and effects change as sagebrush steppe transitions into juniper
   woodlands. Little is currently known about how wildfire influences burn
   severity and ecosystem response in steppe altered by woodland
   conversion. In 2007, the Tongue-Crutcher Wildland Fire burned 18 890 ha
   along a successional gradient ranging from sagebrush steppe to mature
   juniper woodlands, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the
   effects of prefire vegetation on burn severity and ecosystem response
   across spatial scales. Plot-scale burn severity was evaluated with the
   composite burn index (CBI) in locations where prefire vegetation data
   were available, and landscape-scale burn severity was estimated via
   remotely sensed indices (differenced normalized burn ratio {[}dNBR] and
   relative differenced normalized burn ratio {[}RdNBR]). Strong positive
   relationships exist between CBI and remotely sensed burn severity
   indices in woodlands, whereas the relationships are weaker in steppe
   vegetation. Woodlands in late structural development phases, and
   sagebrush patches near developed woodlands, incurred higher burn
   severity than steppe and young woodlands. The results support the idea
   that a threshold exists for when juniper-encroached sagebrush steppe
   becomes difficult to restore. Implications for fire management in
   sagebrush/juniper ecosystems are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{High severity forest fires are increasing in large areas of the southern
   and western United States as the climate becomes warmer and drier. Given
   their strong roles in ecosystem dynamics, documenting the response of
   bird communities to wildfires is important for improving our
   understanding and management of post-wildfire ecosystems. However,
   because wildfires are unplanned events, relatively few studies have been
   conducted to assess local-scale impacts on forest bird communities. In
   this study, we had the opportunity to use a before-after, control-impact
   (BACI) approach to assess the response of resident birds to high
   severity wildfires that occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas in
   September and October 2011. We replicated a previous study using point
   count surveys to assess summer and winter bird community changes ca. 1
   year after the wildfires. We found that total number of detected
   individuals did not change following the wildfires, but winter bird
   species richness increased in burned habitat. Changes were apparent at
   the foraging guild-level for the winter bird community, with an increase
   in aerial insectivores and decrease in bark insectivores. Summer and
   winter bird community composition changes were apparent at the
   species-level and generally agreed with species-specific habitat
   preferences. For example, species such as eastern bluebirds and chipping
   sparrows that prefer open woodlands were positively associated with
   burned habitat. Our results provide quantitative evidence that high
   severity forest fires increased habitat suitability for many resident
   bird species. At the landscape-scale, fire-induced increases in habitat
   heterogeneity could result in higher bird diversity in the Lost Pines
   ecoregion. We expect bird community composition will be dynamic in the
   Lost Pines ecoregion over the next few decades as the burned habitat
   continues to change through successional processes and post-fire
   management actions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire runoff and erosion from wildlands has been well researched,
   but few studies have researched the degree of control exerted by fire on
   rangeland hydrology and erosion processes. Furthermore, the spatial
   continuity and temporal persistence of wildfire impacts on rangeland
   hydrology and erosion are not well understood. Small-plot rainfall and
   concentrated flow simulations were applied to unburned and severely
   burned hillslopes to determine the spatial continuity and persistence of
   fire-induced impacts on runoff and erosion by interrill and rill
   processes on steep sagebrush-dominated sites. Runoff and erosion were
   measured immediately following and each of 3 years post-wildfire.
   Spatial and temporal variability in post-fire hydrologic and erosional
   responses were compared with runoff and erosion measured under unburned
   conditions. Results from interrill simulations indicate fire-induced
   impacts were predominantly on coppice microsites and that fire
   influenced interrill sediment yield more than runoff. Interrill runoff
   was nearly unchanged by burning, but 3-year cumulative interrill
   sediment yield on burned hillslopes (50 g m(-2)) was twice that of
   unburned hillslopes (25 g m(-2)). The greatest impact of fire was on the
   dynamics of runoff once overland flow began. Reduced ground cover on
   burned hillslopes allowed overland flow to concentrate into rills. The
   3-year cumulative runoff from concentrated flow simulations on burned
   hillslopes (298 1) was nearly 20 times that measured on unburned
   hillslopes (16 1). The 3-year cumulative sediment yield from
   concentrated flow on burned and unburned hillslopes was 20400 g m(-2)
   and 6 g m(-2) respectively. Fire effects on runoff generation and
   sediment were greatly reduced, but remained, 3 years post-fire. The
   results indicate that the impacts of fire on runoff and erosion from
   severely burned steep sagebrush landscapes vary significantly by
   microsite and process, exhibiting seasonal fluctuation in degree, and
   that fire-induced increases in runoff and erosion may require more than
   3 years to return to background levels. Published in 2008 by John Wiley

   abrupt changes in vegetation and environmental conditions from alvar to
   forest, without the presence of transition zones in the vegetation or
   environmental gradients as the forest was approached. The environmental
   factors associated with the change from alvar to forest and with
   variation within alvar habitat were examined. Some alvars in the study
   were found to contain stunted, slow-growing trees reaching ages of 524
   yr. These same sites appear to have remained unburned for several
   centuries, while other sites Likely burned 90 yr ago. The plant
   communities were very similar between the alvars that lacked a major,
   biomass-removing disturbance in centuries and alvars that had
   experienced catastrophic fire relatively recently. Maintenance of the

   Miconia albicans, mostly by differential topkill and resprouting. We
   related fire severity to population structure parameters of the study
   species and assessed the effects of fire on its soil seed bank. Basal
   area of non-woody live stems and of dead stems increased with fire
   severity, whereas that of woody live stems decreased, indicating topkill
   and resprouting. However, there was no relationship between fire
   severity and the total number of live or dead plants, showing that
   mortality in the fire was low. We found very few seedlings, indicating
   that resprouting, not germination from the soil seed bank, is the main
   recovery strategy of this species. The fire also affected the soil seed
   bank, as there were fewer seedlings emerging from soil collected in
   burned patches. Although this study was performed with a single species,
   it is likely that other species, especially those with basal
   resprouting, will show similar patterns of post-fire patchiness in
   population structure. This patchiness, in turn, may affect the spatial
   distribution of future fires, and should be taken into account in
   studies of fire ecology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil respiration (Rs) is the second largest carbon flux in terrestrial
   ecosystems and therefore plays a crucial role in global carbon (C)
   cycling. This biogeochemical process is closely related to ecosystem
   productivity and soil fertility and is considered as a key indicator of
   soil health and quality reflecting the level of microbial activity.
   Wildfires can have a significant effect on Rs rates and the magnitude of
   the impacts will depend on environmental factors such as climate and
   vegetation, fire severity and meteorological conditions post-fire. In
   this research, we aimed to assess the impacts of a wildfire on the soil
   CO2 fluxes and soil respiration in a semi-arid ecosystem of Western
   Australia, and to understand the main edaphic and environmental drivers
   controlling these fluxes for different vegetation types. Our results
   demonstrated increased rates of Rs in the burnt areas compared to the
   unburnt control sites, although these differences were highly dependent
   on the type of vegetation cover and time since fire. The sensitivity of
   Rs to temperature (Q10) was also larger in the burnt site compared to
   the control. Both Rs and soil organic C were consistently higher under
   Eucalyptus trees, followed by Acacia shrubs. Triodia grasses had the
   lowest Rs rates and C contents, which were similar to those found under
   bare soil patches. Regardless of the site condition (unburnt or burnt),
   Rs was triggered during periods of higher temperatures and water
   availability and environmental factors (temperature and moisture) could
   explain a large fraction of Rs variability, improving the relationship
   of moisture or temperature as single factors with Rs. This study
   demonstrates the importance of assessing CO2 fluxes considering both
   abiotic factors and vegetation types after disturbances such as fire
   which is particularly important in heterogeneous semi-arid areas with
   patchy vegetation distribution where CO2 fluxes can be largely
   underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how compositional differences in riparian leaf litter
   derived from burned and undisturbed forests influenced leaf breakdown
   and macroinvertebrate communities using experimental mixed-species leaf
   packs in boreal headwater streams. Leaf pack mixtures simulating leaf
   litter from dominant riparian woody-stem species in burned and
   undisturbed riparian zones were incubated in two references and two
   fire-disturbed streams for 5 weeks prior to measuring
   temperature-corrected breakdown rates and macroinvertebrate community
   composition, richness, and functional metrics associated with
   decomposers such as shredder abundance and \% shredders.
   Leaf litter breakdown rates were higher and had greater variability in
   streams bordered by reference riparian forests than in streams where
   riparian forests had been burned during a wildfire. Streams bordered by
   fire disturbance showed significant effects of litter mixture on
   decomposition rates, observed as significantly higher decomposition
   rates of a fire-simulated leaf mixture compared to all other mixtures.
   Variation among sites was higher than variation among litter mixtures,
   especially for macroinvertebrate community composition. In general,
   fire-simulated leaf mixtures had greater shredder abundances and
   proportions, but lower overall macroinvertebrate abundance; however, the
   shredder abundance trend was not consistent across all leaf mixtures at
   each stream.
   These results show that disturbance-driven riparian forest condition and
   resulting composition of leaf subsidies to streams can influence aquatic
   invertebrate community composition and their function as decomposers.
   Therefore, if one of the primary goals of modern forest management is to
   emulate natural disturbance patterns, boreal forest managers should
   adapt silvicultural practices to promote leaf litter input that would
   arise post-fire, thereby supporting stream invertebrate communities and
   their function.}},

   the biophysical effects of fire in C3 dominated mixed-grass prairies and
   to find an effective remote sensing approach for differentiating between
   burn treatments in late spring. Biophysical properties including
   vegetation cover, biomass, soil properties, canopy height, Leaf Area
   Index (LAI), and individual wavebands of the SPOT-5 sensor as well as
   two vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and
   Normalized Burn Ratio Index) derived from SPOT-5 images were compared
   among unburned sites and sites with various burning treatments in
   Grasslands National Park, Canada. Results showed that significantly
   higher soil temperature and lower LAI were found in burned sites. Dead
   material biomass, total biomass, and percentage of standing dead cover
   were significantly lower in burned and grazed sites. The percentage of
   bare ground cover was the only biophysical variable to show significant
   changes in all burning treatments. Burned and unburned sites could not
   be distinguished based on assessing the changes of individual wavebands
   of the SPOT-5 sensor and the two vegetation indices. Models based on
   linear combinations of spectral indices were developed for biophysical

Abstract = {{Fire is a major form of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems, mainly in

   small mammals. We investigated the effects of an extensive wildfire
   (approximate to 6,240 ha) in September 2011 on populations of 2
   arboreal-scansorial small mammals-the gracile mouse opossum,
   Gracilinanus agilis, and the long-tailed climbing mouse, Rhipidomys
   macrurus-in 4 savanna woodland patches (1 burned, 3 unburned) of the
   highly threatened Brazilian Cerrado. We assessed population densities
   from 2009 to 2013 and for G. agilis, we estimated apparent survival and
   recapture probabilities with Cormack-Jolly-Seber models. Both species
   showed strong, negative fire responses, including sudden collapse and
   slow recovery (at least more than 1 year). These observed responses were
   probably a consequence of both the phytophysiognomic features of the
   habitat and severity of the fire with the resulting changes on the
   vertical structure of vegetation. The studied species of Cerrado
   forested formations were not as resilient to fire disturbance as typical
   species from savanna or temperate woodlands. As a consequence of human
   activities and climate changes, fire events are predicted to become
   larger and more frequent in the Brazilian Cerrado. Therefore, it is
   imperative to create new management strategies to protect forested
   physiognomies from fire, especially cerradao, which is very fire
   sensitive and has a limited and scattered distribution in the landscape.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Remnant trees, spared from cutting when tropical forests are cleared for
   agriculture or grazing, act as nuclei of forest regeneration following
   field abandonment. Previous studies on remnant trees were primarily
   conducted in active pasture or old fields abandoned in the previous 2-3
   years, and focused on structure and species richness of regenerating
   forest, but not species composition. Our study is among the first to
   investigate the effects of remnant trees on neighborhood forest
   structure, biodiversity, and species composition 20 years
   post-abandonment. We compared the woody vegetation around individual
   remnant trees to nearby plots without remnant trees in the same
   second-growth forests ({''}control plots{''}). Forest structure beneath
   remnant trees did not differ significantly from control plots. Species
   richness and species diversity were significantly higher around remnant
   trees. The species composition around remnant trees differed
   significantly from control plots and more closely resembled the species
   composition of nearby old-growth forest. The proportion of old-growth
   specialists and generalists around remnant trees was significantly
   greater than in control plots. Although previous studies show that
   remnant trees may initially accelerate secondary forest growth, we found
   no evidence that they locally affect stem density, basal area, and
   seedling density at later stages of regrowth. Remnant trees do, however,
   have a clear effect on the species diversity, composition, and
   ecological groups of the surrounding woody vegetation, even after 20
   years of forest regeneration. To accelerate the return of diversity and
   old-growth forest species into regrowing forest on abandoned land,
   landowners should be encouraged to retain remnant trees in agricultural
   or pastoral fields.}},

   TUSSOCK (CHIONOCHLOA SPP) RANGELANDS FOR PASTORALISM IN SOUTH ISLAND,

Abstract = {{The upland (800-2000 m) snow tussock (Chionochloa spp.) rangelands of
   South Island, New Zealand have a long history of burning that pre-dates
   human occupation during the last millennium. Their present extent in
   part reflects their ability to displace a range of woody vegetation,
   including forest, through tolerance of periodic fire. Research has
   confirmed the general tolerance of these grasslands to fire, though
   recovery of some features (e.g. biomass and flowering potential) may
   take more than 14 years.
   Mammalian grazing, by contrast, is a recent phenomenon, associated with
   European settlement and pastoralism over the last 150 years, on these
   mostly Crown (i.e. public-owned) lands. Such grazing, particularly when
   combined with regular burning, has usually resulted in prolonged
   reductions in tussock biomass, vigour and stability, as well as in the
   control and yield of water, potentially the most valuable product for
   humans from the upland grasslands. Fire promotes vegetative growth,
   flowering and seed germination within 2 years of burning. It also
   increases the palatability of these long-lived dominant grasses which
   are vulnerable to severe grazing by introduced ruminants, especially in
   the immediate post-fire recovery period when nutrients are reallocated
   from roots to leaf tissue.
   Management constraints, particularly restriction of grazing during the
   post-fire recovery period, have been inadequate to prevent continued
   degradation of the grasslands through weakening or displacement of the
   dominant tussock grass cover and a consequent loss of stability in many
   areas. Under pastoralism, the productive potential of the grasslands,
   together with their water, soil and nature conservation values have
   generally declined. Existing pastoral practices in many areas clearly
   represent non-sustainable utilisation of the rangelands for pastoralism.
   Recovery will be difficult and costly, both economically and socially.
   Some representative areas have been formally reserved and are being
   monitored to serve as baseline references.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionCould disturbance by fire and ungulate herbivory alter fire
   regimes by increasing flammability in shrublands and early-successional
   forests?
   LocationNahuel Huapi National Park, northwest Patagonia, Argentina.
   MethodsWe compared four characteristics that influence fuel flammability
   - fine fuel load, plant bulk density, percentage fine fuel, and
   percentage dead fine fuel - and the vertical distribution of live and
   dead fine fuel at recently burned (<15yr) and unburned (>50yr) sites,
   both in the presence and absence of cattle, for six resprouting species:
   non-palatable Lomatia hirsuta and Diostea juncea, moderately palatable
   Nothofagus antarctica and Schinus patagonicus, and highly palatable
   Maytenus boaria and Ribes magellanicum.
   ResultsChanges in flammability in response to recent fire, and to a
   lesser extent cattle browsing, were strongly dependent on species
   identity. Non-palatable L.hirsuta tended to increase in flammability
   following fire, whereas cattle did not affect its fuel properties.
   Nothofagus antarctica showed ambiguous responses: plants had reduced
   plant bulk density at recently burned sites, implying reduced
   flammability, but changes in percentage fine and dead fine fuel point to
   increasing flammability at burned sites with cattle. Diostea juncea and
   S.patagonicus showed increased plant bulk density at sites with cattle
   and increased percentage fine fuel in response to fire. Cattle browsing
   was the main driver of variability in flammability for highly palatable
   species, showing increased plant bulk density and percentage fine fuel
   in response to cattle. Fire had a strong effect on the vertical
   distribution of live and dead fine fuel, showing an increase of burnable
   biomass in response to recent fire. The reduction of vertical fuel
   continuity was extreme on highly palatable species. In contrast,
   moderately and non-palatable species, which are abundant under herbivore
   pressure, were characterized by vertically well-distributed fine fuel
   biomass in the presence of cattle.
   ConclusionsResponses of flammability traits to fire and cattle depended
   on species identity, but the majority of the species studied showed
   higher fuel flammability at recently burned sites affected by cattle.
   Domestic livestock, by increasing the flammability of post-fire
   vegetation, may be key agents in altering fire regimes in
   forest-shrubland mosaics.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of biomass and litter and changes in vegetation
   structure by six managed leguminous fallows, planted in a previously
   cultivated Ultisol (Acrisol) in the Peruvian Amazon, were compared with
   that of naturally established secondary vegetation.  The planted fallows
   included:  Centrosema macrocarpum (CM), Pueraria phaseoloides (PP),
   Stylosanthes guianensis (SG), Desmodium ovalifolium (DO), Cajanus cajan
   (CC), and Inga edulis (IE).  The aboveground mass of planted legumes,
   trees, herbaceous vegetation, and litter and root mass were measured at
   4, 8, 17, 29, 41, and 53 months after fallow initiation; leaf area index
   (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured at 4, 8, and 17 months. 
   After 8 months, total mass in the IE, CC, and DO treatments was
   significantly greater than in the CM and PP treatments; total mass in
   the natural fallow (NF) treatment was similar to that in the IE, CC, and
   DO treatments after 29 months.  Aboveground biomass contributed about
   75-85\% of total mass and was greater when trees were present. 
   Aboveground biomass ranged from 8 (CM) to 63 t ha-1 (IE) at 53 months. 
   Planted legume biomass in most treatments increased until 17 or 29
   months, but later declined when many of the legumes were replaced by
   invading trees.  By 53 months, planted legume biomass represented less
   than 10\% of aboveground mass in all treatments except CM and IE.  The
   LAI increased from 4 to 17 months, but there were few differences among
   treatments at any date; LAD greatly decreased with time in the
   treatments with trees.  The formation and maintenance of dense
   vegetation canopies with high LAD in the CM, SC, and PP treatments
   inhibited the invasion and growth of trees.  Biomass data at 53 months
   suggest that the IE and DO treatments accumulated similar amounts of
   biomass and litter as the NF treatment because of the rapid
   establishment of planted legumes and the successful invasion of trees
   and that the CM, SC, and PP treatments performed poorly because of the
   exclusion of trees.  Further research combining trees and other
   leguminous or non-leguminous vegetation is required to develop
   management practices that maximize biomass accumulation during managed
   fallows.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of ponderosa pine and associated understory vegetation was
   evaluated for a 6 yr period following spring underburning of surface
   fuels. Underburn and control (unburned) plots were paired at 15
   replicate sites in pole-sized ponderosa pine forests of central Oregon.
   The burns were generally low in severity, as noted by low O horizon mass
   reduction (24\%) and tree mortality (6\%). A small but significant
   decline in basal area and volume growth rates of surviving trees was
   found in the 6 yr following underburning. The reduction in tree growth
   was related to a combination of crown length reduction, O horizon
   reduction, and site productivity. More productive stands had the highest
   proportional reduction in growth due to burning. By comparison, site
   conditions including stand density, initial basal area, elevation,
   parent material, and soil fertility were not related to the observed
   growth reduction. Understory vegetation showed a mixed response to
   burning. Shrub cover, dominated by Purshia tridentata, declined
   significantly following burning and remained well below preburn levels
   for the length of the study, even though one-fourth of all burned
   Purshia plants successfully resprouted, Total herbaceous vegetation
   cover and production were unaffected by burning, while species diversity
   increased slightly, With the exception of the decline in Purshia cover,
   the results indicate that low-severity prescribed burning has a
   relatively minor impact on tree-growth and understory response in
   thinned ponderosa pine stands.}},

Abstract = {{Forest soils (mainly soil organic carbon) play an important role in the
   retention of nitrogen and mercury, and loss of the forest floor during
   wildfires can stimulate N and Hg losses. In this paper, we investigate
   long-term impacts of forest fire on soil N and Hg concentrations at
   Acadia National Park (ANP) in Maine. Acadia National Park experienced a
   severe fire in 1947. Within the national park, Hadlock Brook watershed
   was left unburned, whereas most of Cadillac Brook watershed was
   intensely burned, with substantial loss of the forest floor. Post-fire
   regeneration in Cadillac was mostly as hardwood species, whereas
   vegetation in Hadlock remained predominantly softwood. We sampled soils
   in both watersheds in 2015, approximately 70years after the fire. The
   soils were analyzed for total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total
   mercury (THg), and methylmercury (MeHg) content. Compared to Hadlock,
   Cadillac soils had similar to 50\% lower TC, similar to 40\% lower TN,
   and similar to 50\% lower THg content, reflecting the loss of forest
   floor 70years ago. Methylmercury concentrations in Cadillac were
   approximately 2 times the concentrations in Hadlock, indicating that
   conditions were more conducive to methylation, potentially due to
   differences in forest type. Long-term comparisons of stream DOC, NO3-,
   and THg concentrations between the two watersheds demonstrated that
   concentrations were significantly lower in Cadillac Brook, reflecting
   greater retention in Cadillac and a legacy of lower atmospheric
   deposition in the hardwood as compared to softwood watershed. This study
   provides insights on the multi-decadal recovery from a stand-replacing
   disturbance and underscores the persistence of altered soil

Abstract = {{Fire severity and extent are expected to increase in many regions
   worldwide due to climate change. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the
   relative importance of deterministic vs. stochastic factors producing
   remnant vegetation to understand their function in the persistence of
   fire-sensitive plants. Vegetation remnants (areas within the landscape
   that have not burned for a considerable amount of time) may occur
   stochastically or in more predictable locations (fire refuges) where
   physical conditions decrease fire severity. Our aim was to determine if
   remnant forests of the fire-sensitive conifer Austrocedrus chilensis are
   associated with biophysical attributes that allow persistence in a
   fire-prone Patagonian landscape. We conducted a multi-scale approach,
   determining attributes of forest remnants and their surroundings
   (matrices) through remote sensing and field-based biophysical and
   functional characteristics, and quantifying how tree survival
   probability relates to microsite conditions. Trees within remnants
   displayed abundant fire scars, were twofold older and had threefold
   larger growth rates than matrix trees. Remnants were associated with
   high rocky cover and elevated topographical positions. Tree survival
   increased in hilltops, eastern aspects, and with sparse vegetation.
   Trees within remnants experienced severe reductions in growth during
   droughts. Our results suggest that A. chilensis remnants are mainly the
   result of refuges, where environmental conditions increase fire
   survival, but also increase susceptibility to drought. A trade-off
   between fire survival and drought vulnerability may imply that under
   increasing drought and fire severity, locations that in the past have
   served as refuges may reduce their ability to allow the persistence of
   fire-sensitive taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Fire modifies soil surface, and hence soil hydrological properties
   change after wildland fires. High fire severity causes partial or total
   removal of vegetation, reduction of soil aggregate stability and
   increased water repellency, which are associated with high runoff and
   erosion. The spatial connection among these runoff sources is an
   important factor to consider when evaluating fire-induced changes on
   hillslope and catchment hydrology, as fire generates connected areas of
   bare soil, which may increase hydrological connectivity and hence
   post-fire runoff and erosion. The aim of this studywas to quantify
   changes in hydrological connectivity and efficiency in two burned areas
   in central Mexico. By integrating rainfall simulation and spatial
   analysis, an index of connectivity (IC) and the lateral hydrological
   efficiency index (LHEI) were computed based on land/cover use, fire
   severity and topography within 287 burned sub-basins. Post-fire IC and
   LHEI were compared with the pre-fire scenario, and the relationship
   between LHEI and the proportion of burned area was assessed at the
   sub-basin level. Thresholds of the burned area per fire severity needed
   to increase LHEI were determined by a classification tree. The index of
   connectivity and LHEI were higher after wildland fires. The burned area
   was positively related with LHEI, and at least 43.3\% of area burned
   with high severity is sufficient to produce the highest LHEI. The
   results are evidence of the effect of fire on hydrological connectivity
   and efficiency which adds to the understanding of fire-hydrology
   relations and can be used for integrated catchment management,
   ecological restoration and risk assessment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney (MMF) model was used as a modelling
   approach, which has performed reasonably well to estimate soil losses
   for burned areas in humid Mediterranean forests in Portugal, and NW
   Spain. Simple model enhancement approaches are applied to recently
   burned pine and eucalypt forested areas in north-central Portugal and to
   subsequent post-wildfire rehabilitation treatments. Model enhancement is
   validated by applying it to another similar burned area to evaluate
   model calibration robustness and wider applicability. Model
   modifications involved: (1) focusing on intra-annual changes in
   parameters to incorporate seasonal differences in runoff and erosion;
   and (2) inclusion of soil water repellency in runoff predictions. The
   main results were that following wildfire and mulching in the
   plantations: (1) the revised model was able to predict first-year
   post-fire plot-scale runoff and erosion rates (NS(Runoff) = 0.54 and
   NS(Erosion) = 0.55) for both forest types, and (2) first year
   predictions were improved both by the seasonal changes in the model
   parameters (NS(Runoff) = 0.70 and NS(Erosion) = 0.83); and by
   considering the effect of soil water repellency on the runoff
   (NS(Runoff) = 0.81 and NS(Erosion) = 0.89), (3) the individual seasonal
   predictions were considered accurate (NS(Runoff) = 0.53 and NS(Erosion)
   = 0.71), and the inclusion of the soil water repellency in the model
   also improved the model at this base (NS(Runoff) = 0.72 and NS(Erosion)
   = 0.74). The revised MMF model proved capable of providing a simple set
   of criteria for management decisions about runoff and erosion mitigation
   measures in burned areas. The erosion predictions at the validation
   sites attested both to the robustness of the model and of the
   calibration parameters, suggesting a potential wider application. (C)

Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The negative hydrological effects of wildfire are very difficult to
   predict in Mediterranean forest ecosystems, due the intrinsic climate
   and soil characteristics of these areas. Among the hydrological models
   simulating surface runoff and soil erosion in these environmental
   contexts, the semi-empirical Morgan-Morgan-Finney (MMF) model can ensure
   the representation of the main physical processes, while offering ease
   of use and limiting the number of input parameters. However, literature
   reports very few modelling studies using MMF in burned areas of the
   Mediterranean environment with or without post-fire rehabilitation
   measures. To fill this gap, the capacity of the MMF model to predict the
   seasonal surface runoff and soil loss in a Mediterranean forest was
   verified and improved for unburned plots and areas affected by a
   wildfire, with and without post-fire straw mulch treatment. The
   application of MMF with default input parameters (set up according to
   the original guidelines of the model's developers) led to poor
   performance. Conversely, after introducing some changes in input data
   for both the hydrological and erosive components (seasonal values of
   evapotranspiration, reduction of the soil hydrological depth, including
   soil water repellency effects in burned soils, and modelling erosive
   precipitation only), MMF was able to predict seasonal runoff volumes and
   soil loss with good reliability in all the experimented conditions.
   This modelling experiment has shown the capacity of the MMF model to
   simulate the seasonal hydrological and erosion response of the
   experimental unburned and burned soils of Mediterranean semi-arid
   forests. Although more research is needed to validate the model's
   prediction capacity in these conditions, the use of MMF as a management
   tool may be suggested to predict the hydrogeological risk in these
   delicate ecosystems threatened by wildfire, as well as to evaluate the
   potential efficiency of soil treatments after fire.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of plant communities is an important issue for sustainable
   forest management. In case of several parallel dynamic tendencies
   occurring within a group of research objects similar to each other,
   their demarcation may be difficult. The aim of the research was to check
   the applicability of numerical classification to distinguish the dynamic
   trends of plant communities on the example of multidirectional reaction
   of oligotrophic pine forest Peucedano-Pinetum W. Mat. (1962) 1973 to
   surface fire. The research was conducted in the post-fire site
   originated in spring 2015 in the Kampinoski National Park (central
   Poland). The set of 45 permanent plots was established. They differed in
   the degree of disturbance, measured as the share of the total burnout of
   the soil organic horizon. The phytosociological survey was carried out
   every year between 2015 and 2018, using the Londo scale. The use of
   cluster analysis for classification of vegetation changes requires an
   uniform unit for each of the variables. It was expressed as the ratio of
   the difference between the positions of the research plots (registered
   vegetation states) in the indirect space of the ordination analysis and
   the time elapsed between them. Thus the subject of the classification
   were the multidimensional changes (beta diversity) expressed in the unit
   of speed. The obtained material was arithmetically transformed and
   ordered using the PCoA method with the Bray-Curtis distance. The range
   of changes was calculated as differences in the plot position in three
   annual intervals separately for each of the four main gradients of the
   ordination. The 12 annual change values obtained for each of the plot
   were subjected to Ward classification. In order to verify the nature of
   the obtained clusters, collective covers of species belonging to higher
   syntaxones were calculated and their changes during the research period
   compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. The
   significance of differences in the degree of initial disturbance was
   also checked. On the basis of the Ward classification, the division into
   five dynamic groups of plots was obtained. An analysis of the changes in
   the coverage of higher syntaxonomic groups revealed the existence of
   statistically significant differences between the clusters in 55 out of
   110 possible cases. The presence of significant differences in the
   initial degree of disturbance by fire was also noted. The studied plot
   groups represent the regeneration process (A and B), pine forest
   regression combined with secondary succession (groups C and D) and the
   control group - not-disturbed pine forest (E). The cluster analysis
   method was proved to be an effective tool for classifying objects in
   terms of different tendencies of vegetation dynamic.}},

   altered soil at sites with different tree densities. Water-repellent
   soils were more extensive in forest than woodland. Deposits of white
   ash, composed largely of calicite, covered at most similar to 25\% of
   the land surface, in places where large fuel items ( e.g. logs,

   kg ha(-1) of CaCO3 in ash was deposited over the forest, and at least
   700 kg ha(-1) was added to the woodland. Combustion of logs and large
   branches also reddened the underlying yellow-brown soil as deep as 60mm
   ( average 8 mm), and over similar to 1-12\% of the land surface. The
   reddened soils have magnetic susceptibilities that are three to seven

Abstract = {{The increasing potential for wildfires in Mediterranean-type landscapes
   has resulted in pressure to mitigate fire threats. This is typically
   achieved by strategic reduction of fuel. To prioritise fuel management,
   it is necessary to understand vegetation dynamics and the relationships
   between plants and fuel. As the direct measurement of fuel in the field
   is labour intensive, mapped vegetation classes are typically used as to
   estimate fuel load. As vegetation properties vary continuously, the
   error in such estimates can be high. Remotely sensed and biophysical
   data are commonly used for vegetation classification, but rarely for
   estimating fuel load. This study investigated how fuel load varied with
   vegetation composition in an Australian woodland and assessed the
   potential for using biophysical models to create continuous estimates.
   Fuel was found to be influenced by species abundance, with some species
   having a greater contribution to load than others. Fuel was found to be
   somewhat predictable, with quantities related to fire history and
   several other biophysical variables. Models were applied to create
   continuous maps of fuel load; these provided a more precise
   representation of fuel variation than using discrete classes. Improved
   maps have the potential to facilitate improved prediction of fire

Abstract = {{Impacts on the understorey vegetation of a range of silvicultural
   alternatives to clearfelling in lowland Eucalyptus obliqua wet forest
   were studied over a decade in the Warra silvicultural systems trial in
   southern Tasmania. The treatments were clearfell with understorey
   islands, patchfell, stripfell, dispersed retention, aggregated
   retention, and single-tree/small-group selection. High intensity
   burning, low intensity burning and no burning were variously applied as
   part of these treatments. Three understorey types were studied,
   including one wet sclerophyll community and two rainforest communities.
   Wherever burning occurred across the research trial, the regenerating
   vegetation was floristically wet sclerophyll with an incipient
   composition consistent with that of the pre-harvest wet sclerophyll
   community. Sites previously occupied by rainforest understoreys retained
   occasional rainforest elements, but the regeneration was overwhelmingly
   sclerophyll in nature. There were no consistent differences in the
   floristic composition of the regenerating vegetation, after burning or
   harvesting disturbance, that could be attributed to the silvicultural
   system. However, field observations and the results of a related,
   subsequent study suggest that, in designing silvicultural trials similar
   to the present one, close attention should be paid to the size of
   quadrats in relation to the level at which disturbance impacts are
   operating. The response of the vegetation at edges created by the
   treatments, and in the undisturbed forest beyond, supports the finding
   that edge effects on the vascular flora extend for less than 10m into
   the undisturbed forest.}},

Title = {{Effects of a Prescribed Fire on Understory Vegetation, Carbon Pools, and

Abstract = {{We quantified fire-driven loss and post-fire recovery of understory and
   soil carbon (C) and nutrient pools for one to three years following a
   single prescribed fire in a naturally regenerated longleaf (Pinus
   palustris Mill.) and slash pine (Pintis elliottii Engelm. var.
   elliottii) forest located in north central Florida. Fire immediately
   reduced total aboveground understory C and nitrogen (N) pools, but these
   pools recovered to pre-fire levels after three years. Our results also
   showed that the effect of fire on the understory composition and
   structure was only short-lived. Prescribed fire significantly reduced
   total C and N pools in the forest floor (F and H horizon,,), and this
   effect persisted for at least one year postfire. Available NH4+, PO43-,
   Ca2+, Mg-2, and K+ concentrations in the forest floor decreased
   immediately after fire, but increased in the surface mineral soil (0 to
   5 cm depth); Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ remained elevated for the first year
   after fire. Fire immediately reduced total ecosystem C and N pools by
   40\% and 27\%, respectively, emitting 3860 g C m(-2) and 170 g N m(-2)
   to the atmosphere. The pools recovered to 67\% and 76\% of pre-fire C
   and N pools, respectively, after one year. Of the pools measured, C and
   N recovery in forest floor materials was the slowest, and projections of
   initial recovery rates suggest that it will take more than six years,
   the previous fire interval, to reach pre-fire levels. This slow recovery
   may indicate variation in past rates of forest floor accumulation due to
   management practices as well as effects of the severity of this or
   previous fires.}},

Abstract = {{Several large, uncharacteristic wildfires occurred on the Boise National
   Forest in Southwest Idaho, from 1986 to 2003. From 1987 to 1994, severe
   wildfires burned almost 50\% of the ponderosa pine forest types (about
   200,000 ha). The intensity of the fires varied across the landscape,
   with a mix of low to moderate severity, and lesser amounts of high burn
   severity. After the fires, localized debris flows favored smaller order
   streams in watersheds less than 4000 ha in size, where there had been
   mostly high severity burning. Locally, areas experiencing high heat and
   post-fire debris flows had reduced fish numbers and altered fish
   habitats. Uncharacteristic wildfires on the managed portions of the
   Boise National Forest appeared to have more pronounced, short-term
   effects on fish habitats as compared with characteristic wildfires in
   the Central Idaho Wilderness. Even in the most severely impacted
   streams, habitat conditions and trout populations improved dramatically
   within 5-10 years. Post-fire floods apparently rejuvenated stream
   habitats by exporting fine sediments and by importing large amounts of
   gravel, cobble, woody debris, and nutrients, resulting in higher fish
   productivities than before the fire. These observations suggest that
   important elements of biodiversity and fish productivity may be
   influenced, or even created by fire-related disturbances. In some cases,
   habitats that were completely devoid of salmonid fishes just after the
   debris floods, were later re-colonized with migrants returning from
   downstream or nearby tributary rearing habitats. Re-population was
   likely enhanced by higher fecundity, homing instinct, and greater
   mobility of the larger migratory fish. Ecosystem restoration activities
   that reduce both short- and long-term threats of uncharacteristic
   wildfire on imperiled fishes could be emphasized in areas where local
   populations may be weak and/or isolated, but potentially recoverable.
   But forest ecosystem restoration alone may not reduce risks to fish if
   existing habitat conditions and isolation are limiting the population.

Abstract = {{The structure and diversity of Isopoda and Collembola communities are
   described and compared in burnt and unburnt sites occupied by oak and
   pine forests within a Mediterranean coastal ecosystem in central Italy
   (near Rome) to assess the effect of fire on these soil arthropods. The
   community succession, starting just after the fire, proceeded
   differently in the examined sites, showing distinct ecological responses
   between Collembola and Isopoda, as evinced by cluster analysis among
   sites and comparisons of species abundances. The burnt oak forest
   communities, less damaged by fire, were quite different from the burnt
   pine forests, which had few species, usually more abundant in
   individuals. Examining the mean of the whole abundance of each site,
   particularly in isopods, burnt sites showed greatly reduced values in
   comparison with unburnt sites. Both springtail and isopod communities of
   burnt sites showed a continuous turnover, evidenced by both temporally
   restricted species and temporal variations in species richness
   determined by post-fire recolonisation. The species succession produced
   disequilibria of monthly and yearly abundances, which interacted with
   monthly variations in community structure determined by meteorological
   factors. The community structure stabilisation in burnt ecosystems
   during the succession is also demonstrated by the increasing of Shannon
   diversity and evenness values, particularly in Collembola. On the basis
   of temporal values of species richness and Shannon diversity values
   recorded for each site, two main patterns can be recognised: (1) oak
   forests were more diverse than pinewoods, and (2) unburnt sites were
   temporally more diverse than the burnt ones, because they host
   communities mostly subject to seasonal changes, especially due to some
   variations in humidity, rainfall and temperature. Burnt habitats tended
   to change their species composition more drastically, without any clear
   relationship with seasonality, because of the interaction of
   recolonisation with seasonal replacing of species, which determine a
   greater value of final ``entropy{''}, as observed by the total annual
   values of Shannon diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The great desert skink (Liopholis kintorei) of the Egerniinae subfamily
   (Reptilia: Scincidae) is a communal burrowing lizard that inhabits arid
   spinifex grasslands in central Australia. Great desert skink activity is
   centred in and around the burrows which are inhabited for many years.
   However, it is not known whether skinks select burrow sites with
   specific attributes or how continuing occupancy of burrows is influenced
   by the surrounding habitat; especially post-fire, when plant cover is
   reduced. Here, we test whether great desert skink burrows in areas burnt
   2 years previously and in longer unburnt areas are associated with
   particular habitat attributes, and whether there are differences between
   occupied and recently abandoned burrow sites. Vegetation composition,
   cover and soil surface characteristics at 56 established great desert
   skink burrows, including occupied and recently unoccupied burrows, were
   compared with 56 random nearby non-burrow control sites. Burrow sites
   had higher plant cover compared with the surrounding landscape in both
   recently burnt and longer unburnt areas and were more likely to be
   associated with the presence of shrubs. Soil stability and infiltration
   were also higher at burrow sites. However, we found no evidence that
   burrows with lower cover were more likely to be abandoned. Our results
   suggest that great desert skinks may actively select high cover areas
   for burrow construction, although differences between burrow and control
   sites may also partly reflect local changes to plant cover and
   composition and soil properties resulting from burrow construction and
   long-term habitation of a site. Further research should determine if
   burrows with shrubs or higher plant cover provide greater protection
   from predators, more structural stability for burrow construction,
   increased prey abundance or other benefits. We recommend that
   maintenance of areas with relatively higher plant cover be prioritized
   when managing great desert skink habitat.}},

Abstract = {{As an important freshwater lake and wetland area with international
   significance in biodiversity conservation, Poyang Lake is facing
   increasing pressure from human activities, including prescribed fire. In
   the present study, two representative wetland plants from Poyang Lake
   (Carex cinerascens and Artemisia selengensis) were selected to determine
   their in situ regeneration success following a prescribed winter fire.
   Monitoring of plant growth and species composition was carried out
   monthly for one year following burn treatments. Results showed that
   significantly higher densities of both C. cinerascens and A. selengensis
   were observed in the spring. Moreover, the prescribed fire had little
   influence on the aboveground and belowground biomasses of C.
   cinerascens, whereas a significant effect on A. selengensis was
   observed. A smaller difference in dominance values of constructive
   species was detected between burned and unburned plots. However, a
   significant increase in biodiversity was found within the burned A.
   selengensis community in spring. In addition, there was little
   difference in plant traits and community characters found between burned
   and unburned plots after the flooding season. Our findings suggest that
   the water regime is the main driving factor in regulating the ecological
   process of Poyang Lake, and a single prescribed fire was not sufficient
   to change the plant community structure, although it did have a
   significant influence on biomass and species composition in the season
   following the fire. (C) 2017 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wildfires have become more frequent and intense in recent years in the
   western United States. Previous studies have investigated the potential
   environmental and economic impacts of active management in burned forest
   landscapes. No previously published study, however, has considered
   wildlife requirements for snags while planning salvage logging
   operations in postburned landscapes. We examined the potential impacts
   of 19 snag retention strategies using cable-based yarding systems over a
   3-year time period since burn. The strategies were based on current
   research recommendations, operational needs, and state and federal
   policies. Potential impacts on two cavity-nesting bird habitats and the
   feasibility of each strategy were examined. We found that most snag
   retention strategies generated net revenues per unit volume of
   merchantable wood greater than \$70/m(3) immediately after a burn and
   \$60/m(3) 3 years after a burn. Those strategies that focused snag
   retention on smaller-diameter stems had the highest net revenue values
   and higher productivity rates. We also found that the strategy that
   removed all merchantable snags did not produce the highest revenue. In
   general, decreased yarding distance and a smaller yarding system (e.g.,
   shovel loader) resulted in greater net revenue per unit volume with
   increased time since burn. The salvage strategy that provided the most
   favorable habitat for the two cavity-nesting birds left all snags
   standing in the half of the salvage unit farthest away from the yarder.
   Our findings indicate that it is possible to provide adequate
   cavity-nesting bird habitat and generate net revenue during fire salvage
   operations.}},
