Abstract = {{Agricultural land use is a leading cause of habitat degradation, leaving
   a legacy of ecological impacts long after agriculture has ceased. Yet
   the mechanisms for legacy effects, such as altered plant community
   composition, are not well understood. In particular, whether plant
   community recovery is limited by an inability of populations to
   establish within post-agricultural areas, owing to altered environmental
   conditions within these areas, remains poorly known. We evaluated this
   hypothesis of post-agricultural establishment limitation through a field
   experiment within longleaf pine woodlands in South Carolina (USA) and a
   greenhouse experiment using field-collected soils from these sites. In
   the field, we sowed seeds of 12 understory plant species associated with
   remnants (no known history of agriculture) into 27 paired remnant and
   post-agricultural woodlands. We found that post-agricultural woodlands
   supported higher establishment, resulting in greater species richness of
   sown species. These results were context dependent, however, with higher
   establishment in post-agricultural woodlands only when sites were
   frequently burned, had less leaf litter, or had less sandy soils. In the
   greenhouse, we found that agricultural history had no impact on plant
   growth or survival, suggesting that establishment limitation is unlikely
   driven by differences in soils associated with agricultural history when
   environmental conditions are not stressful. Rather, the potential for
   establishment in post-agricultural habitats can be higher than in
   remnant habitats, with the strength of this effect determined by fire
   frequency and soil characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Mulching fuels treatments have been increasingly implemented by forest
   managers in the western USA to reduce crown fire hazard. These
   treatments use heavy machinery to masticate or chip unwanted shrubs and
   small-diameter trees and broadcast the mulched material on the ground.
   Because mulching treatments are relatively novel and have no natural
   analog, their ecological impacts are poorly understood. We initiated a
   study in 2007 to examine the effects of mulching on vascular understory
   plant communities and other ecological properties and processes. We
   established 15 study areas in Colorado, USA, distributed across three
   broadly-defined coniferous forest types: pinyon pine - juniper (Pinus
   Mulls Juniperus spp.); ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) and ponderosa pine
   - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii); and lodgepole pine (P. contorta)
   and mixed conifer (lodgepole pine, limber pine (P. flexilis), and other
   conifers). Measurements were conducted along 50-m transects 2-4 years
   post-treatment (2007 or 2008), and again 6-9 years post-treatment
   (2012), in three mulched and three untreated stands per study area.
   Mulching dramatically reduced overstory basal area (i.e., basal area of
   trees >1.4 m tall) and increased forest floor biomass (i.e., the biomass
   of litter, duff, and woody material <2.5 cm in diameter) for all three
   forest types, as evidenced by previous measurements conducted in our
   mulched and untreated stands 2-4 years post-treatment. The total
   richness and cover of understory plant species in mulched stands 2-4
   years post-treatment were either similar to, or greater than, the
   richness and cover in untreated stands for the three forest types;
   however, by 6-9 years post-treatment, total understory plant richness
   and cover in mulched stands were always greater. The stimulatory effect
   of mulching on understory plants was largely driven by the response of
   graminoids and forbs; mulching had little effect on shrub richness or
   cover. The increases in total understory plant richness and cover in
   mulched stands 6-9 years post-treatment occurred despite the fact that
   understory plants tended to be heavily suppressed in localized areas
   where the forest floor layer was deep, because such areas were rare.
   Exotic plant richness and cover were commonly higher in mulched than
   untreated stands in both sampling periods, but nonetheless understory
   plant communities remained highly native-dominated. Taken as a whole,
   our findings suggest that mulching treatments promoted denser and more
   diverse native understory plant communities in these three Colorado
   coniferous forest types, particularly over the longer-term. Published by

Abstract = {{Piiion-juniper woodlands of the western United States have expanded 2 to
   10-fold since the late 1800's. Tree control measures using chainsaws,
   heavy equipment and prescribed fire have been used to reduce woodlands
   and restore big sagebrush steppe and decrease woody fuel loading. We
   evaluated nutrient availability and herbaceous recovery following
   various cutting and prescribed fire treatments in late succession
   western juniper woodlands on two sites in southeast Oregon from 2007 to
   2012. Sites were a cool, wet big sagebrush-Idaho fescue association
   (FESCUE), highly resistant to exotic annual grasses and a warm dry big
   sagebrush-bluebunch wheatgrass association (BLUEBUNCH), moderately
   resistant to annual grass invasion. Treatments were untreated controls,
   partial cutting followed by fall broadcast burning (SEP), cut and leave
   (CUT), and cut and burn in winter (JAN) and spring (APR). Soil inorganic
   N (NO3-, NH4+), phosphorus (H2PO4-), potassium (K+), and cover of
   herbaceous species were measured in three zones; interspace, litter mats
   around the tree canopy (canopy), and beneath felled trees (debris).
   Following woodland cutting, the results of the various slash treatments
   measured significant differences through time in the availability of
   inorganic N, P, and K and vegetation composition. Peak nutrient
   availability tended to occur within the first two years after treatment.
   The increases in N, P, and IC were greatest in severely burned debris
   and canopy zones of the SEP and APR treatments. Invasive annual grass
   cover was positively correlated to soil inorganic N concentrations.
   Herbaceous composition at the FESCUE site was generally resistant to
   annual grasses after juniper treatments and native plants dominating
   post-treatment even in highly impacted debris and canopy zones of the
   SEP treatment. The BLUEBUNCH site was less resistance and resilient,
   thus, exotic annual grasses were a major component of the understory
   especially when tree and slash burning was of high fire severity. To
   lessen these impacts requires slash burning be applied from late fall to
   early spring, when fuel moisture and relative humidity are higher, to
   maintain an adequate perennial herbaceous composition for recovery.

Abstract = {{Previous empirical work has shown that feedbacks between fire severity,
   soil organic layer thickness, tree recruitment, and forest growth are
   important factors controlling carbon accumulation after fire
   disturbance. However, current boreal forest models inadequately simulate
   this feedback. We address this deficiency by updating the ED2 model to
   include a dynamic feedback between soil organic layer thickness, tree
   recruitment, and forest growth. The model is validated against
   observations spanning monthly to centennial time scales and ranging from
   Alaska to Quebec. We then quantify differences in forest development
   after fire disturbance resulting from changes in soil organic layer
   accumulation, temperature, nitrogen availability, and atmospheric CO2.
   First, we find that ED2 accurately reproduces observations when a
   dynamic soil organic layer is included. Second, simulations indicate
   that the presence of a thick soil organic layer after a mild fire
   disturbance decreases decomposition and productivity. The combination of
   the biological and physical effects increases or decreases total
   ecosystem carbon depending on local conditions. Third, with a 4 degrees
   C temperature increase, some forests transition from undergoing
   succession to needleleaf forests to recruiting multiple cohorts of
   broadleaf trees, decreasing total ecosystem carbon by approximate to
   40\% after 300 years. However, the presence of a thick soil organic
   layer due to a persistently mild fire regime can prevent this transition
   and mediate carbon losses even under warmer temperatures. Fourth,
   nitrogen availability regulates successional dynamics; broadleaf species
   are less competitive with needleleaf trees under low nitrogen regimes.
   Fifth, the boreal forest shows additional short-term capacity for carbon
   sequestration as atmospheric CO2 increases.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, temperate grasslands and meadows have sharply declined in
   spatial extent. Loss and fragmentation of grasslands and meadows may
   impact biodiversity, carbon storage, energy balance, and climate change.
   In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, grasslands and meadows
   have declined in extent over the past century. Largely undocumented in
   this regional decline are the grass balds of the Oregon Coast Range,
   isolated grasslands in a landscape dominated by coniferous forests. This
   study was conducted to quantify the spatial extent and patterns of grass
   bald change. Five balds in the Oregon Coast Range were evaluated using
   historical aerial photographs and recent digital orthophoto quadrangles
   (DOQ). Over the time period of study (1948/1953 to 1994/2000), bald area
   declined by 66\%, primarily from forest encroachment. The number and
   average size of bald vegetation patches declined, while edge density
   increased. Tree encroachment into balds was inversely related to
   distance from nearest potential parent trees. Spatial patterns of bald
   loss may result from a forest to bald gradient of unfavorable
   environmental conditions for tree establishment and/or seed dispersal
   limitation. Species dependent on balds may be at risk from loss of bald
   area and increased fragmentation, although metrics of habitat
   fragmentation may not reflect species-specific habitat requirements.
   Tree encroachment patterns and increased bald edge densities suggest
   increasing rates of bald loss in the future. The remote sensing nature
   of this study cannot determine the fundamental causes of bald decline,
   although prior research suggests climate change, cessation of native
   burning, successional changes in response to prior wildfires, and
   cessation of livestock grazing all may have potential influence.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disturbance-based management and conservation strategies are
   needed to protect forest biodiversity. Boreal forests of northern Europe
   are typically clearcut and otherwise intensively managed for timber
   production. As a result, natural disturbances such as forest fires have
   became rare and the volume of dead wood has decreased. These changes
   have had a profound negative effect on species that depend on dead wood
   (saproxylic). Therefore, it is important to determine whether
   modifications of forest management methods can enhance the survival of
   these species. In our study area in southern Finland, we determined
   whether burning of logged sites and leaving trees (i.e., retention
   trees) on the sites benefited saproxylic, rare, and red-listed beetle
   species and how long the burned sites remained suitable habitat for
   these species. We surveyed the beetle fauna at 40 sites logged 1-16
   years previously, 20 of which were burned after logging. The abundance
   and species richness of saproxylic beetles were positively affected by
   burning, but the effect depended on the retention of trees in the
   otherwise clearcut stands. The difference between burned and unburned
   sites increased with the number of retention trees, and the effect of
   burning was not significant when there were fewer than approximately 15
   retention trees/ha. Most important, the species groups that were
   unlikely to persist in ordinarily managed forests (rare saproxylic and
   red-listed beetles), benefited strongly from burning and tree retention.
   The species richness of saproxylic beetles decreased with time since
   logging at both burned and at unburned sites. We conclude that burning
   of logged sites and leaving an adequate number of retention trees may be
   useful in the conservation of disturbance-adapted species and can be
   used to improve the environmental quality of the matrix surrounding
   protected areas. Unfortunately, sites remained high-quality habitat for
   only a short time; thus, a continuum of burned areas must be ensured.}},

Abstract = {{After a century of fire suppression, conifer forests in the western
   United States have dramatically departed from conditions that existed
   prior to Euro-American settlement, with heavy fuel loads and an
   increased incidence of wildfire. To reduce this threat and improve
   overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale
   treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to
   disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the
   remaining area. A necessary step in designing and evaluating these
   treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We
   used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal
   (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective
   harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on
   wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that
   small-diameter removal and burning treatments would have minimal effects
   on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies that met
   our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for
   wildlife species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments,
   (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact design
   using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New
   Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer
   (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis
   occurred <20 years post-treatment on sites <400 ha. Small-diameter
   harvest and burning treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and
   selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most small
   mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory
   removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. We
   examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds
   and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging
   birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter removal
   and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and
   wildfire. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently
   being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the
   wildlife species in the studies we examined in the short-term (: 10
   years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement
   across the landscape will result in the highest diversity and density.
   We recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments,
   but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species
   at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative
   response variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of
   data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   oak-pine communities, a management practice that could also affect
   understory species composition and richness. We examined the four-year
   effects of a single, late-winter prescribed fire on understory
   vegetation and tree regeneration. There was a nonsignificant trend of
   increased species richness in burned areas, mostly due to an elevated
   number of herbaceous species. There were no significant effects of fire
   on herb and shrub cover. Higher densities of oak, yellow-poplar
   (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) seedlings in
   burned areas occurred only in the second growing season after fire.
   Total sprouting, especially of red maple and flowering dogwood (Cornus
   florida L.), was higher for two growing seasons following fire. Fire
   promoted regeneration by fire-tolerant and fire-intolerant species

   8.9\%/yr in Huistan and by 8.6\%/yr in Chanal, while open/disturbed
   forest, secondary vegetation, and developed area increased in both
   municipalities. The total number of fragments increased by 1.4\%/yr and

Abstract = {{Runoff and soil erosion, based upon plot studies, have been reviewed for
   southern China. They reveal, with the exception of tree crops, no strong
   association for a given land use between runoff and erosion. The data
   support the concept of vegetation as a major control upon runoff and
   sediment production. Forest and woodland have an average erosion rate of
   0.05 t ha(-1) year(-1); the lowest rate for a given cover. Tree crops
   experience a slightly higher erosion rate followed by a scrub-grass
   cover. Cultivated slopes and bare soil, with respective mean erosion
   rates of 62.4 and 153.0 t ha(-1) year(-1), experience the greatest
   erosion. In terms of runoff production the ranking (low to high) goes
   from forest-woodland, scrub-grass to tree crops and bare to cultivated
   slopes. Sediment yield and runoff under various ground covers are
   presented as a ratio to those obtained under forest and this underlines
   the influence of land use. Further support is given by the use of
   additional studies from South-east Asia and Tanzania. Variability of
   sediment production, and to a lesser extent runoff under any given land
   use or cover, is an important feature of the data. Results from a study
   in Hong Kong support the importance of ground cover in controlling
   erosion. For example, sediment yield in splash pans on two plots where
   vegetation was cut were 2.6 and 3.8 times those of the central. Two
   plots, which were burnt, had sediment catches 5.4 and 3.1 times those of
   the control. However, observations of suspended sediment levels in a
   small stream suggest no great change in sediment levels after burning,
   which raises the question of sediment delivery from slopes to channels.
   The erosion rates reported for cultivation raise the question as to how
   long such rates can continue before productivity is affected. Further
   consideration needs to be given to economic aspects of erosion and to
   temporal variability. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   east-west trends at the scales of study area and CFK in terms of fire
   return interval (FRI) and fire season. FRIs (8-26 years; 1980-2010) were
   comparable to those elsewhere in the CFK and appeared to be shorter in
   the eastern Tsitsikamma than in the western Outeniqua halves of the
   study area. Proteaceae juvenile periods (4-9 years) and post-fire
   recruitment success suggested that for biodiversity conservation
   purposes, FRIs should be >= 9 years in eastern coastal fynbos.
   Collectively, findings on the seasonality of actual fires and the
   seasonality of fire danger weather, lightning and post-fire proteoid
   recruitment suggested that fires in eastern coastal fynbos are not
   limited to any particular season. We articulated these findings into
   ecological thresholds pertaining to the different elements of the fire
   regime in eastern coastal fynbos, to guide adaptive management of fire
   in the Garden Route National Park and elsewhere in the region.
   Conservation implications: Wildfires are likely to remain dominant in
   eastern coastal fynbos, whilst large-scale implementation of prescribed
   burning is unattainable. Fires occurring in any season are not a reason
   for concern, although other constraints remain: the need for sufficient
   fire intensity, safety requirements, and integration of fire and
   invasive alien plant management.}},

Abstract = {{RAHARIMALALA O, BUTTLER A, SCHLAEPFER R \& GOBAT J-M. 2012. Quantifying
   biomass of secondary forest after slash-and-burn cultivation in Central
   Menabe, Madagascar. Biomass is the principal input of nutrients in
   slash-and-burn cultivation of tropical dry deciduous forest. In this
   paper, we report the aboveground biomass of ligneous and herbaceous
   vegetation as a function of the age of abandonment after cultivation in
   order to analyse the potential amount of nutrients released into the
   soil. To estimate the biomass of trees, we used dendrometric classes
   based on height and circumference at breast height of all individual
   plants inventoried in the plots in four growth types. For biomass
   measures, we harvested representative trees in each defined class. The
   quantity of total biomass increased with age of abandonment, reaching 72
   t ha(-1) after 40 years of abandonment. The species that contributed
   most to biomass were Fernandoa madagascariensis, Diospyros perrieri,
   Dalbergia sp., Poupartia silvatica, Tarenna sericea, Xeromphis sp.,
   Phylloctenium decaryanum, Stereospermum euphorioides and Croton
   greveanum. Diospyros increased regularly already after 10 years of
   abandonment. The biomass of Dalbergia also increased with the age of
   abandonment, but after 30 years, this quantity decreased because of
   selective harvest by farmers. Fernandoa increased after 30 years, as did
   Poupartia, but the latter became a key player as it was, comparatively,
   the species with the highest biomass shortly after 30 years of
   abandonment.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between earth, wind, and fire have always played an
   important role in the formation and evolution of the level plains of the
   Llano Estacado of North America. The uppermost sediments of this vast
   region are aeolian deposits, formed by aeolian deposition into grassland
   vegetation. Grass cover enhances aeolian deposition by slowing
   near-surface winds and vegetation secures sediments once they are
   deposited. The benefits of grass cover, however, are lost when
   occasional fires remove protective vegetation from fields. After a fire,
   the underlying soil surface becomes exposed and susceptible to wind
   erosion until the vegetative cover is re-established. The purpose of
   this study was to explore the post-fire recovery process by monitoring
   temporal variations in aeolian transport and changes in the threshold
   velocity of a burned grass field located in Lubbock County, Texas. A
   continuous record of wind erosion activity was obtained during a
   six-month period as the surface recovered from a highly erodible state
   to a more vegetated and stable surface. Results suggest that the
   threshold wind speed of the field increased from less than 10 m/s
   immediately following the fire to above 19 m/s in a three-month period
   as vegetation naturally recovered. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Small-holding farmers of the Brazilian Amazon often use a rotation of
   secondary forest, slash-and-burn land-clearing and fallow phase
   regeneration for agriculture. In recent decades reduction of the fallow
   phase from similar to 20 to similar to 5 years has limited nutrient
   accumulation by fallow vegetation to sustain future crop growth.
   Slash-and-mulch and improved fallow schemes, including use of native
   nitrogen-fixing species, have been investigated to address the issue. In
   the current study in eastern Amazonia of Brazil, a 7-year old forest
   site was slash-and-mulched and four treatments applied; no fertilizer
   and no N-fixer as the control; no fertilizer with N-fixer; P + K
   fertilizer with no N-fixer; P + K fertilizer with N-fixer. Manioc was
   planted in all plots at establishment. After manioc harvest and 4 years
   of fallow, a total of 6 years after planting, use of P + K fertilizer
   increased tree growth of four of five planted species. In the presence
   of the N-fixer I. edulis, trends of increased growth and survival among
   these four tree species were observed. After 6 years, fertilization with
   P + K significantly increased tree volume and biomass. The N-fixer
   lowered survival of other species yet increased estimated N uptake of
   planted trees. Use of P + K fertilizer without N-fixer might allow for
   commercial harvest of S. amazonicum at the end of one 7-year crop-fallow
   cycle without jeopardizing agroecosystem N stocks. Use of P + K
   fertilizer in the presence of I. edulis can increase planted-tree
   N-content but increases in competition may limit commercial harvest yet
   may better sustain future food crop growth.}},

Title = {{A framework to predict the effects of livestock grazing and grazing
   exclusion on conservation values in natural ecosystems in Australia}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{401-415}},
Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic livestock has greatly degraded many Australian
   ecosystems and its legacy will be longlasting in many areas. Although
   livestock are usually removed from conservation reserves because they
   are perceived to be incompatible with the conservation of natural
   ecosystems, they have been retained in several reserves in south-eastern
   Australia as a management tool to achieve conservation outcomes. These
   cases highlight the fact that no framework currently exists to address
   the question, under what circumstances ( and in what ecosystems) is
   livestock grazing - or the removal of grazing - likely to have positive,
   negative, neutral or uncertain impacts on the diversity and composition
   of native plants? This paper provides a conceptual framework to predict
   the effects of livestock grazing and grazing exclusion on the
   conservation values of native vegetation across natural ecosystems in
   Australia. It should prove equally relevant to other ecosystems around
   the world which have evolved without heavy grazing by large herbivores.
   The framework is based on disturbance- and grazing-ecology literature
   from Australia and elsewhere, and incorporates the following six main
   factors: ( 1) impacts of livestock grazing on soil and ecosystem
   processes, ( 2) historical exposure to grazing, ( 3) site productivity,
   ( 4) relative palatability of dominant species, ( 5) species-specific
   factors influencing plant recruitment and ( 6) spatial scale and
   landscape context. These factors are integrated into a decision tree to
   describe the potential impacts of livestock on native vegetation in a
   particular area. Livestock grazing is likely to have detrimental impacts
   on conservation values in many ecological contexts, especially in
   relatively intact, uninvaded ecosystems on unproductive soils. By
   contrast, it may be a useful management tool to achieve conservation
   objectives where it either ( 1) controls the biomass of existing
   potentially dominant, grazing-sensitive plants ( native or exotic), ( 2)
   prevents encroachment by undesirable, grazing-sensitive, potential
   dominants, ( 3) provides disturbance niches required by rare or
   significant plant species, ( 4) maintains fauna habitat structure or (
   5) enhances the diversity of species and vegetation structures across
   the landscape, especially when most of the landscape is ungrazed. In
   many cases, other disturbance regimes ( especially burning) may achieve
   similar outcomes; however, other disturbances will not necessarily be
   more effective than grazing per se, especially in degraded or invaded
   areas. The framework provides a coarse-level filter to inform management
   decisions and to allow the findings from individual studies to be placed
   in a larger ecological context. Although the framework is intended to
   improve decisions about conservation management, it is clear that much
   more research is needed to assess the role of grazing exclusion in
   previously grazed ecosystems, and that modi. cations to current grazing
   regimes require testing, perhaps by using adaptive management
   principles, to ensure optimal outcomes for biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Biodiversity is being lost rapidly due to anthropogenic
   changes in land use, climate, and other environmental conditions. In
   fire-maintained ecosystems, altered fire regimes accelerate native
   species loss - community disassembly - and promote recruitment of
   fire-sensitive species. In this study, we ask whether fire suppression
   results in changes over time in functional trait composition of
   ground-layer species and whether these changes differ in longleaf pine
   savannas invaded by hardwoods from those invaded by sand pines. Location
   Five Floridian locations on the southeastern coastal plain of the United
   States. Methods At each location we selected a fire-maintained and
   fire-suppressed savanna and measured percent plant cover by ground-story
   species in 1,000 m(2) plots. For 102 of these species, we measured 10
   functional traits - height, growth form, specific leaf area, leaf dry
   matter content (LDMC), leaf water content, leaf ignition time, leaf mass
   consumed by fire, light compensation points (LCPs), non-structural
   carbohydrate concentrations in under-ground organs, and seed mass.
   Results Fire exclusion was associated with reductions in both functional
   diversity and species richness. We identified 38 species exclusive to
   frequently burned sites: these species showed high LDMC values, high
   LCPs, high leaf mass consumed, and low leaf ignition time values. Lack
   of fire was associated with loss of 6 of the 12 C-4 native grass
   species. Species and functional trait composition were affected by both
   time-since-fire and whether post-fire communities were invaded by
   broadleaved trees (Quercus spp. and Liquidambar styraciflua) or by sand
   pine (Pinus clausa). Conclusions We demonstrated the effects of altered
   disturbance regimes on savanna plant species and functional trait
   composition. This trait-based approach advanced our understanding of how
   altered disturbance regimes can alter plant communities. Although 38
   shade-intolerant and flammable native savanna species were absent by 10
   years since fire, 12 such species persisted even 40 years after fire
   exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance of vegetation and soil may change the species composition of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which may in turn affect plant
   species responses to AMF. Seasonal tropical forest in Mexico is
   undergoing rapid conversion to early-successional forest because of
   increased wildfire and may require restoration. The responses of six
   early- and late-successional tree species were tested using early- and
   late-successional AMF inoculum. The plants were germinated in the
   shadehouse and received three inoculum treatments: (1) soil from a
   two-year-old burned site, (2) soil froth a mature forest site, or (3)
   uninoculated controls. They were transplanted as seedlings to a site
   prepared by burning, and their growth was measured from September 1997
   to November MOO. All six species had the greatest growth response to
   early-seral inoculum, but the response to late-seral inoculum varied.
   Two tree species, Ceiba pentandra and Guazuma ulmifolia, were smallest
   with late-seral inoculum, even smaller than the uninoculated. plants,
   and the other species, Brosimum alicastrum, Havardia albicans, Acacia
   pennatula, and Leucaena leucocephala, had intermediate growth with
   late-seral inoculum. Of these, Brosimum, Havardia, and Ceiba occur in
   late-successional forest, and the others are early seral. Of the several
   growth measurements (height, cover, biomass, stem diameter),
   stem-diameter responses to inoculum were still significantly different
   into the third year for four of the species. The uninoculated plants
   became infected by residual inoculum in the burned experimental site
   within three months of transplanting, yet mycorrhizal responses
   persisted. The treatment, size differences may be due to different
   species composition of the inocula. The early-seral inoculum was
   dominated by small-spored Glomus spp., while the late-seral inoculum had
   a higher density of large-spored Gigasporaceae. The latter are known
   from greenhouse experiments to promote a smaller plant-growth response
   than Glomus. Mature forest trees may withstand the carbon drain from
   Gigasporaceae better than establishing seedlings, so the growth patterns
   we observed with inoculum source are consistent with a rapidly growing
   successional forest, followed by slower-growing mature forest. The
   results suggest that early-seral AMF should be used when seedlings are
   inoculated for restoration, even for late-seral tree species.}},

   central U.S.; this site in Maine is a marginal outlier, and shows
   patterns of stand history and tree growth that contrast with the more
   commonly described central populations. Jack pine is associated with
   fire as a disturbance agent, and sees its best growth on deep loamy to
   sandy soils. In contrast, the Acadia stands have not burned since the
   nineteenth century, and both are along exposed ridge tops with little to
   no soil. Serotiny is low and regeneration is continuous without fire.
   One of the sites shows high growth rates and substantial recent
   regeneration; the other stand is older, and vigorous red spruce (Picea
   rubens Sarg.) is co-dominant. Neither stand displays an origin pattern
   of rapid post-fire development, nor the classic successional sequence of
   sharply decreasing regeneration and growth rates as a shade-tolerant
   increases. In a coastal year-round wet climate, this marginal jack pine

Volume = {{573}},

Abstract = {{Fire-prone Mediterranean shrublands may be seriously threatened by land
   degradation due to progressive opening of the vegetation cover driven by
   increasing drought and fire recurrence. However, information about the
   consequences of this opening process for critical ecosystem functions is
   scant. In this work, we studied the influence of vegetation amount,
   type, and spatial pattern in the variation of extracellular soil enzyme
   activity (acid phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, and urease) in fire-prone
   shrublands in eastern Spain. Soil was sampled in vegetation-patch and
   open-interpatch microsites in 15 shrubland sites affected by large
   wildfires in 1991. On average, the activities of the three enzymes were
   1.5 (beta-glucosidase and urease) to 1.7 (acid phosphatase) times higher
   in soils under vegetation patches than in adjacent interpatches. In
   addition, phosphatase activity for both microsites significantly
   decreased with the fragmentation of the vegetation. This result was
   attributed to a lower influence of roots -the main source of acid
   phosphatase- in the bigger interpatches of the sites with lower patch
   cover, and to feedbacks between vegetation pattern, redistribution of
   resources, and soil quality during post-fire vegetation dynamics.
   Phosphatase activity was also 1.2 times higher in patches of resprouter
   plants than in patches of non-resprouters, probably due to the faster
   post-fire recovery and older age of resprouter patchesin these
   fire-prone ecosystems. The influence on the studied enzymes of
   topographic and climatic factors acting at the landscape scale was
   insignificant. According to our results, variations in the cover,
   pattern, and composition of vegetation patches may have profound impacts
   on soil enzyme activity and associated nutrient cycling processes in
   fire-prone Mediterranean shrublands, particularly in those related to
   phosphorus. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in post-fire runoff and erosion have been reported worldwide,
   but little is known about the combined effect of wildfires and
   pre-existent ploughing operations. A previous study using simulated
   rainfall found a similar runoff for an unploughed and a pre-fire
   ploughed site, but clearly showed lower erosion for the pre-fire
   ploughed site. This study measured post-fire runoff and erosion at the
   same two sites, with the same experimental design, but under natural
   rainfall conditions. Four micro-plots were installed on each of two
   eucalypt stands, one of which was rip-ploughed 20 years before the fire.
   The rainfall amount was 35\% lower during the first post-fire year than
   during the second, but the runoff coefficient was approximately 20\% for
   both years and sites. The sediment losses were significantly higher on
   the unploughed than on the pre-fire ploughed site during the first year
   (378 vs. 112 g m(-2) y(-1)) and especially during the second year (552
   vs. 67 g m(-2) y(-1)). Half of the eroded sediments consisted of organic
   matter. On the unploughed site, both the natural and the
   extreme-intensity simulated rainfall produced specific sediment losses
   of 0.35 g m(-2) mm(-1) rain, whereas the high-intensity simulated
   rainfall produced approximately half (0.16 g m(-2) mm(-1) rain). At the
   pre-fire ploughed site, the natural, high, and extreme-intensity
   simulated rainfall produced similarly low-specific sediment losses (0.07
   g m(-2) mm(-1) rain). These low rates and the absence of differences
   between methodologies and simulated intensities suggested a depletion of
   soil stocks 20 years after the rip-ploughing. Copyright (C) 2015 John

Abstract = {{The impact of fire on daily discharges from two mountainous basins
   located in the permafrost region of Eastern Siberia, the Vitimkan
   (969km(2)) and Vitim (18200km(2)) rivers, affected by fire over 78\% and
   49\% of their areas, respectively, in 2003, was investigated. The
   results of hydrological and meteorological data analysis suggest that
   the Vitimkan River basin had a rapid and profound hydrological response
   to wildfire in 2003 expressed through a 41\% (133mm) increase of summer
   flow. Conversely, the larger Vitim River basin showed no significant
   changes in discharge after the fire. The parameters of the process-based
   hydrological model Hydrograph were estimated for pre-fire conditions.
   The results of runoff simulations conducted for the continuous pre-fire
   periods of 1966-2002 and 1970-2002 for the Vitimkan and Vitim river
   basins, respectively, on a daily time step, showed satisfactory
   agreement with the observed flow series of both basins. Significant
   underestimation of precipitation and its poor representativeness for
   mountainous watersheds was revealed as the main cause of observed and
   simulated flow discrepancies, especially for high flood events. The set
   of dynamic parameters was developed based on data analysis and post-fire
   landscape changes as derived from a literature review. The model was
   applied to investigate the processes in the soil column and their effect
   on runoff formation during the post-fire period. The new set of model
   parameters implied the intensification of soil thaw, reduction of
   infiltration rate and evapotranspiration, and increase of upper
   subsurface flow fraction in summer flood events following the fire.
   According to modelling results, the post-fire thaw depth exceeded the

Abstract = {{We evaluated differences in the effects of three low-severity spring
   prescribed burns and four wildfires on nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry in
   Rocky Mountain headwater watersheds. We compared paired
   (burned/unburned) watersheds of four wildfires and three spring
   prescribed burns for three growing seasons post-fire. To better
   understand fire effects on the entire watershed ecosystem, we measured N
   concentrations and delta N-15 in both the terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems components, i.e., soil, understory plants in upland and
   riparian areas, streamwater, and in-stream moss. In addition, we
   measured nitrate reductase activity in foliage of Spiraea betulifolia, a
   dominant understory species. We found increases of delta N-15 and N
   concentrations in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem N pools after
   wildfire, but responses were limited to terrestrial N pools after
   prescribed burns indicating that N transfer from terrestrial to aquatic
   ecosystem components did not occur in low-severity prescribed burns.
   Foliar delta N-15 differed between wildfire and prescribed burn sites;
   the delta N-15 of foliage of upland plants was enriched by 2.9 parts per
   thousand (difference between burned and unburned watersheds) in the
   first two years after wildfire, but only 1.3 parts per thousand after
   prescribed burns. In-stream moss delta N-15 in wildfire-burned
   watersheds was enriched by 1.3 parts per thousand, but there was no
   response by moss in prescription-burned watersheds, mirroring patterns
   of streamwater nitrate concentrations. S. betulifolia showed
   significantly higher nitrate reductase activity two years after
   wildfires relative to corresponding unburned watersheds, but no such
   difference was found after prescribed burns. These responses are
   consistent with less altered N biogeochemistry after prescribed burns
   relative to wildfire. We concluded that delta N-15 values in terrestrial
   and aquatic plants and streamwater nitrate concentrations after fire can
   be useful indicators of the magnitude and duration of fire effects and
   the fate of post-fire available N.}},

Abstract = {{Fuel load is a primary determinant of fire spread in Australian forests.
   In east Australian forests, litter and canopy fuel loads and hence fire
   hazard are thought to be highest at and beyond steady-state fuel loads
   15-20 years post-fire. Current methods used to predict fuel loads often
   rely on course-scale vegetation maps and simple time-since-fire
   relationships which mask fine-scale processes influencing fuel loads.
   Here we use Light Detecting and Remote Sensing technology (LiDAR) and
   field surveys to quantify post fire mid-story and crown canopy fuel
   accumulation and fire hazard in Dry Sclerophyll Forests of the Sydney
   Basin (Australia) at fine spatial-scales (20 x 20 m cell resolution).
   Fuel cover was quantified in three strata important for crown fire
   propagation (0.5-4 m, 4-15 m, >15 m) over a 144 km(2) area subject to
   varying fire fuel ages. Our results show that 1) LiDAR provided a
   precise measurement of fuel cover in each strata and a less precise but
   still useful predictor of surface fuels, 2) cover varied greatly within
   a mapped vegetation class of the same fuel age, particularly for
   elevated fuel, 3) time-since-fire was a poor predictor of fuel cover and
   crown fire hazard because fuel loads important for crown fire
   propagation were variable over a range of fire fuel ages between 2 and
   38 years post-fire, and 4) fuel loads and fire hazard can be high in the
   years immediately following fire. Our results show the benefits of
   spatially and temporally specific in situ fuel sampling methods such as
   LiDAR, and are widely applicable for fire management actions which aim
   to decrease human and environmental losses due to wildfire. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Natural disturbances such as wildfires cause significant alterations to
   the structure and functioning of semi-arid ecosystems. After such
   disturbances, the recovery of the soil ecosystem as a whole, and more
   specifically the belowground microbial communities, is poorly
   understood. In this study, we aimed to (a) assess the short, medium and
   long term changes in soil physicochemical and microbiological indicators
   and indices after a wildfire in a semi-arid environment, (b) analyse the
   key relationships of multiple soil parameters and indices, and (c)
   identify the most suitable indicators of post-fire recovery. The study
   was conducted across a wildfire chronosequence spanning sites recently
   burnt (three months) through to 14 years after fire in a semi-arid
   hummock grassland ecosystem of northern Western Australia. Immediate
   effects of the fire on the soil system were evident with increases in
   pH, electrical conductivity, and available nutrients. These chemical
   indicators showed a strong correlation with fire age and were consistent
   in the direction of change. Variations in the microbial composition were
   apparent one year after the fire, with a higher proportional abundance
   of bacterial communities. The fungi to bacteria ratio and the microbial
   quotient (proportion of microbial C to total organic C) proved to be
   significant indices to reflect the recovery of soils in these semi-arid
   environments. Overall, this study highlights the importance of
   understanding the post-fire response of belowground ecosystems, and
   particularly changes and recovery of soil microbial communities, at
   different time periods. The approach and methods followed in this
   research can be effectively extrapolated to other areas. This study can
   be used to inform better soil management of degraded systems in a
   rapidly changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using pre- and post-fire satellite imagery from SPOT2, we examined the
   fire severity and intensity of the Christmas 2001 wildfires in the
   greater Sydney Basin, Australia. We computed a Normalised Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the two satellite images captured before (
   November 2001) and after ( January 2002) the wildfires, then subtracted
   the later from the former to produce a difference image (NDVIdiff) which
   was subsequently classified into six fire severity classes (unburnt,
   low, moderate, high, very high and extreme severity). We then tested the
   fire severity classification on 342 sample sites within the 225 000 ha
   fire affected area using a qualitative visual assessment guide. We found
   that the NDVIdiff classification produced an accuracy of at least 88\%
   (K-hat = 0.86), with the greatest discrepancy being between the low and
   moderate classification. Knowledge of rate of spread over some of the
   affected area, coupled with a complete knowledge of fuel loads, was used
   to retrospectively model fire intensity, which in areas of extreme fire
   intensity, produced heat energy levels exceeding 70000 kWm(-1).
   Importantly, we found no positive effect of topography on fire severity,
   in fact finding an inverse relationship between slope and fire severity
   and no effect due to aspect. Further analysis showed that flat to
   moderate slopes less than 18. across all aspects suffered the greatest
   vegetal destruction, and there was no relationship between
   north-westerly aspects and fire severity. We also introduce a relatively
   simple method for estimating fuel load biomass using a combination of
   satellite image and rapid field assessment. We found 79\% accuracy for
   this method based on 125 sample sites. It is postulated that this type
   of analysis can greatly improve our understanding of the spatial impact
   of fire, how natural areas within the fire ground were impacted, and how
   remote sensing and GIS technologies can be efficiently used in fire
   management planning and post-fire analysis.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{396-406}},
Abstract = {{The historical and modern importance of crown fires in ponderosa pine
   and dry mixed-conifer forests of the south-west USA has been much
   debated. The microscopic reflectance of charcoal in polished blocks
   under oil shows promise as a semiquantitative proxy for fire severity
   using charcoal from post-fire landscapes. We measured the reflectance of
   33 modern charcoal samples to evaluate (1) whether charcoal reflectance
   can distinguish between crown fires and surface fires in these forests;
   and (2) whether surface fires with masticated fuels burn with severities
   similar to surface fires in grass, litter and duff fuels. The charcoal
   analysed was primarily collected after wildland fires under two
   different conditions: (l) wildfires with moderate to high severity and
   crown fire behaviour (n = 17), and (2) prescribed fires with low to
   moderate severity but no crown fire behaviour (n = 16). Statistical
   analysis indicates that charcoal reflectance produced in crown fires
   significantly differs from surface fire charcoal, particularly surface
   fire charcoal formed in grass, duff and litter fuels. However, charcoal
   produced from surface fires in masticated fuels is indistinguishable
   from crown fire charcoal, suggesting that fires in areas that have
   experienced in situ mastication may have soil impacts similar to crown
   fires.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variability in cone production may influence
   post-disturbance succession, yet it is not well understood. We sampled
   15-year old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands (n =
   16) that regenerated naturally after the 1988 Yellowstone fires and
   varied in stand density (566-545,200 stems ha(-1)) and elevation to
   quantify and explain variation in cone production. Among stands, the
   percentage of trees bearing cones ranged from 10 to 80\% and was greater
   in stands with larger trees and at lower elevations. Mean cone abundance
   was 3.7 cones tree(-1) (range of 0.10-17.85 cones tree(-1) for the 16
   stands) and increased with mean basal diameter and decreasing elevation.
   The earliest onset of cone production was 1997, and early onset was
   associated with lower elevations (< 2300 in). Cone density ranged from
   1082 to 1,0 15,665 cones ha(-1) among the stands, with most of this
   variation explained by a positive relationship with stand density.
   Although scrotinous cones were not expected in such young stands, we
   observed serotinous cones (albeit infrequently) in five of the 16
   stands. Serotinous cones were only recorded at elevations < 2230 in
   where fire return intervals are relatively short (< 200 years). Among
   individual trees (n = 320), 33\% bore cones, and both cone presence and
   abundance were positively related to tree basal diameter. Cone
   production in the young post-fire lodgepole pine stands that regenerated
   after the 1988 Yellowstone fires is both abundant and spatially
   variable, and lodgepole pine in this system might produce serotinous
   cones earlier than reported previously. The abundant canopy seed bank in
   young post-fire stands suggests substantial resilience of this forested
   landscape to extensive stand-replacing disturbance. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is increasingly used to inhibit woody encroachment into
   fire-dependent ecosystems, yet its effects on other processes
   influencing invasion are poorly understood. We investigated how fire
   influences exotic woody invasion through its effects on granivore
   activity, and whether these effects depend on the habitat in which seed
   predation takes place. We quantified seed removal for four species of
   exotic woody plants (Albizia julibrissin, Elaeagnus umbellata, Melia
   azedarach and Triadica sebifera) in 17 sites in longleaf pine savanna
   that varied in time since fire (one or three growing seasons post-fire)
   in the sandhills region of North Carolina, USA. Within each site, we
   established paired plots in upland and upland-wetland ecotone
   communities and presented seeds in depots that allowed either arthropod,
   or arthropod and small vertebrate access. We found that differences in
   seed removal with time since fire were contingent on habitat and
   granivore community. In ecotones, three of four species had higher
   proportions of seeds removed from plots that were three growing seasons
   post-fire than plots one growing season post-fire, whereas only T.
   sebifera showed this pattern in upland habitat. Allowing vertebrate
   granivores access to seeds enhanced seed removal, and this effect was
   strongest in ecotone habitat. While granivores removed seeds of all four
   plant species, removal of E. umbellata was significantly higher than
   that of the other species, suggesting that granivores exhibited seed
   selection. These findings suggest that ecotone habitats in this system
   experience greater seed removal than upland habitats, particularly as
   time since fire increases, and differences are mainly due to the
   activity of vertebrate granivores. Such differences in seed removal,
   together with seed selection, may contribute to variation in exotic
   woody invasion of longleaf pine savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in plant community structure and composition of the Mojave
   Desert in response to greater fire intensity and extent are likely to
   have strong bottom-up effects on the biological community. The objective
   of this study was to determine how expansive fire in Mojave Desert
   impacts small mammal communities across seasons. We sampled small
   mammals in paired burned (4-5 years post-fire) and unburned areas of
   Beaver Dam Wash in southwestern Utah. Fire reduced total abundance of
   small mammals, and species richness and species diversity of the small
   mammal community. Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami) responded
   positively to fire (15\% greater in burned areas). Long-tailed pocket
   mouse (Chaetodipus formosus) and canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinitus) were
   91\% and 98\% less abundant in burned versus unburned areas. The
   positive response of Merriam's kangaroo rat to fire is most likely
   correlated with their preference for open foraging microhabitat while
   other species captured prefer greater and more diverse cover. Because
   the small mammal community has been dramatically affected by fire, it is
   likely that top-down control of vegetation structure will be dominated
   by Merriam's kangaroo rat in burned areas, which may promote more open

Abstract = {{1. Regeneration, mortality, local extinction, growth and foliar
   elemental concentrations of indigenous (ericoid, restioid, proteoid) and
   alien (acacia) plant forms and concentrations of soil elements were
   compared in stands of the invasive Australian Acacia saligna and in
   surrounding sand plain lowland fynbos vegetation after an autumn fire.
   2. All indigenous forms regenerated less successfully in acacia-infested
   than in natural habitats. Seedling:parent ratios of proteoids were 32\%,
   restioids 42\% and ericoids 65\% of those in natural vegetation.
   Seedling mortalities of all plant forms were not different in the two
   habitats.
   3. Simulated probabilities of extinction, based on the measured spatial
   variation in seedling:parent ratios of different forms in acacia stands
   and in natural vegetation, showed that the risk of local extinction
   after fire was three to four times greater for ericoids, five times
   greater for proteoids and seven times greater for restioids in
   acacia-infested than in natural habitats. Within a 10-m2 acacia stand
   area, the probability of extinction of proteoids was high (99-7\%) and
   moderate (56-57\%) for ericoid and restioid forms.
   4. Soil N, Ca, Mg, K, Mn and B concentrations were higher and soil Fe
   concentrations lower in acacia-infested than in natural habitats; but
   the only significant concentration increases recorded for all plant
   forms were in the N and K of seedling leaves in acacia stands.
   5. Seedling shoot and root dry masses of all forms, except restioids
   which had the lowest foliar elemental concentrations, were unaffected by
   the higher soil nutrient concentrations beneath acacias. Increased
   shoot:root ratios observed among indigenous forms in acacia-infested
   habitats reflected responses to shading by burnt acacia parental
   remnants rather than soil mineral enrichment. Acacia shoot:root ratios
   were unaffected by the different environmental conditions in acacia
   stands.
   6. It is concluded that the mineral enrichment of lowland fynbos soils
   by acacias has no detrimental effect on post-fire seedling growth and
   survival of indigenous taxa. The depletion of indigenous taxa,
   particularly obligate reseeding forms, beneath acacia stands results
   mainly from their poor seed regeneration success and associated
   increased risk of local extinction from stochastic causes in this
   habitat after fire.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in both climate and fire frequency have been documented but the
   combined effects of these are poorly understood in freshwater systems,
   thus making it imperative for long-term studies in pristine habitats to
   quantify climate-mediated wildfire effects in lotic systems. We
   quantified the response of invertebrates and basal food resources in 6
   wilderness streams in central Idaho USA for 8 years pre-fire and 5 years
   post-fire. We found that a shift in climate toward increased temperature
   and reduced peaks in snow-melt runoff moderated the effects of wildfire
   on basal food resources and altered invertebrate community structure and
   annual variation. Taxon richness significantly increased over the
   13-year study period at all sites regardless of fire. Post-fire changes
   were accompanied by an increase in the relative abundances of chironomid
   midges and Baetis mayflies, which generally are regarded as
   disturbanceadapted taxa. Ordination analysis of invertebrate community
   biomass showed that both unburned and burned streams differed between
   pre- and post-fire years and combined, our results suggest that the
   effects of climate ameliorated the effects of fire. We found significant
   correlations between community structure and climatic variables of
   precipitation, temperature, and discharge in all streams. Our findings
   support previous studies that attribute a large part of negative fire
   effects on stream ecosystems to major increases in runoff from sparsely
   vegetated uplands and attendant restructuring of channels and substrata.
   However, we found during a period of climate warming and reduction in
   snow-melt runoff, these adverse effects were suppressed resulting in
   increases in basal food resources and invertebrate density and biomass
   following fire. Our results show the importance of long-term studies in
   quantifying community changes in responses to disturbance under a

   <0.001, 64.5\% variance explained). Although Trembling Aspen <50 cm tall
   explained the most variance, its canopy cover did not exceed 10\%. More
   Trembling Aspen cover <50 cm tall and greater deadfall depths within the
   chronosequence were associated with stands <= 20 years old. Peak
   Snowshoe Hare use occurred in early (<= 20 years old) rather than
   mid-successional (21-120 years old) stands, contrary to use patterns
   reported elsewhere. The lack of tall understory shrubs likely limited
   the use of mid-successional stands.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of burning and grazing on plant, ground beetle and spider
   species was investigated experimentally in stands of varying ages (burnt
   in 1982 and 1988 and unburnt plots) on an area of heather moorland in
   County Antrim, north-east Ireland. Burning initiated complex succession
   pathways which appear to have characteristic plant and invertebrate
   species associations. Removal of Calluna dominance initiated a period of
   high plant species diversity. Investigation of initial post-fire
   regeneration suggested that the frequency of occurrence of plant species
   changed over time and was affected by grazing. Grouping of species by
   the position of their renewal bud, i.e. their life-form, did not account
   for all observed interspecific variation. The dominant species after
   burning were Eriophorum vaginatum, E. angustifolium and Vaccinium
   myrtillus. Studies of vegetation canopy structure showed that, even with
   the exclusion of the main grazing herbivores, Calluna will not
   re-establish itself as the dominant species until several years after
   burning. The ground beetle Nebria salina was trapped more often on plots
   burnt in 1988 than on unburnt plots or those burnt in 1982. In
   comparison, Pterostichus niger and Carabus granulatus were trapped in
   greater numbers on plots burnt in 1982 than on unburnt plots and plots
   burnt in 1988. The large species Carabus problematicus and Carabus
   glabratus were trapped in greater numbers on unburnt plots. Similarly,
   more of the spiders Ceratinella brevipes and Centromerita concinna were
   trapped on the plots burnt in 1982. In comparison, Lepthyphantes
   zimmermanni and Robertus lividus were trapped more often on unburnt

Abstract = {{The post-fire demography of Eucalyptus luehmanniana, a wet-mallee
   eucalypt restricted to the Sydney region, was studied by descriptive and
   experimental methods. Patterns of growth and reproduction were related
   to time since the last fire for 15 populations burned from 2 to 24 years
   previously. After fire, mature individuals (clumps) resprout from
   subterranean lignotuberous buds producing numerous narrow stems.
   Resprouted clumps flower within 2-4 years and fruit within 5-6 years of
   the last fire. Fruits accumulate in the canopy with increasing time, up
   to at least 24 years since fire. Measurements from one reproductively
   mature population showed that there is a low level of seed-fall below
   the canopy (0.98 seeds m-2 day-1) in the absence of fire. Recruitment
   without fire appears unlikely due to a combination of factors: low seed
   viability (34.9\%, s.e. = 5.3), low levels of field emergence, no
   soil-stored seed, and a high proportion (86.9\%, s.e. = 3.4) of seed
   failing enclosed in capsules. Canopy-stored seed is released en masse
   following fire.
   Three factors potentially influencing the recruitment of E. luehmanniana
   seedlings, fire-related effects, water availability and protection of
   developing seedlings from animals, were investigated experimentally in
   the field. Seedling emergence was uniformly low (2.2-2.6\%), and not
   significantly increased on burned plots, caged plots, or water-added
   plots alone. In one experiment, plots both burned and caged had
   significantly higher emergence. Mortality in all experimental plots was
   100\% within 6 months. Seedling recruitment of E. luehmanniana will not
   occur following all fires, and will depend on the coincidence of fire
   with suitable post-fire conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Fire plays a fundamental role in the structure of vegetation communities
   in the Caldenal. However, this effect has decreased considerably since
   the introduction of domestic cattle, which reduces the amount of fine
   combustible material. Objectives of this study were (1) to analyze the
   diversity and composition of a typical vegetation community in the south
   of the Caldenal after exposure to different fire frequencies, and (2) to
   show the convenience of using controlled fire for reversing the
   processes of scrub formation to states with more diverse and productive
   grassland communities. Forty-five herbaceous and woody species were
   recorded. Treatment C (control) showed the greatest richness and
   diversity in December 2006 and 2007. After the last controlled fire, the
   composition of the vegetation community differed significantly between
   treatment C and treatments T-1 and T-2 (with burns every 3-4 and 7-8
   years, respectively). This change was mainly due to the proliferation of
   palatable perennial grasses. Vegetation composition was similar for C
   and T-2 (ANOSIM, R=0.01, p=0.32 and R=0.06, p=0.01, respectively) in
   2006 and 2007. However, treatment T, showed significant changes (ANOSIM,
   R=0.42, p=0.01). Nasella clarazii, which is a characteristic palatable
   grass in the region, was the perennial forage grass with greatest cover
   in treatment T2, whereas it was scarce in treatments C and T-1.
   Unpalatable grasses and bushes grew at sites without fire, e.g.
   treatment C in this study. Our results show that use of controlled fire
   of intermediate frequencies would favor the aerial cover of palatable
   perennial grasses in states that are most useful for sustainable cattle
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (GO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile
   organic carbon, and aerosols emitted as a result of the deliberate or
   accidental burning of natural vegetation constitute a large component of
   the greenhouse gas emissions of many African countries, but the data
   needed for calculating these emissions by the IPCC methodology is sparse
   and subject to estimation errors. An improved procedure for estimating
   emissions from fires in southern Africa has been developed. The proposed
   procedure involves reclassifying existing vegetation maps into one of
   eleven broad, functional vegetation classes. Fuel loads are calculated
   within each 0.5 x 0.5 degrees cell based on empirical relationships to
   climate data for each class. The fractional area of each class that
   burns is estimated by using daily low-resolution satellite fire
   detection, which is calibrated against a subsample of pre- and post-fire
   high-resolution satellite images. The emission factors that relate the
   quantity of gas released to the mass of fuel burned are based on recent
   field campaigns in Africa and are related to combustion efficiency,
   which is in turn related to the fuel mix. The emissions are summed over
   the 1989 fire season for Africa south of the equator. The estimated
   emissions from vegetation burning in the subcontinent are 0.5 Tg CH4,
   14.9 Tg CO, 1.05 Tg NOx and 1.08 Tg of particles smaller than 2.5 mu m.
   The 324 Tg CO2 emitted is expected to be reabsorbed in subsequent years.
   These estimates are smaller than previous estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances generated by forest restoration treatments have the
   potential for enhancing the establishment of nonnative species thereby
   impeding long-term native plant recovery. In a ponderosa pine forest
   next to the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, Arizona, we examined the
   establishment of nonnative species after three alternative treatments
   with different intensities of tree thinning, coupled with prescribed
   burning and an untreated control, in relation to total species abundance
   and richness. Pretreatment data were collected in 1998 and postreatment
   responses were measured from 2001 through 2006. Total herbaceous cover
   and richness were significantly higher in the two more intensely thinned
   areas compared to the control over the entire post-treatment period.
   Native species were the most prevalent in terms of cover (92\%) and
   richness (90\%) across all treated units, though greater under-story
   plant responses were linked to heavier amounts of tree thinning.
   Nonnative species abundance and richness also increased significantly in
   response to restoration treatments, particularly in the two more intense
   treatments. The proportion of nonnative abundance to the total abundance
   within the two heavily treated areas decreased through time and began to
   converge back towards the undisturbed control unit. One year following
   treatments, 15\% of the total cover (27\%) was composed of nonnative
   species in the heaviest treated unit. This proportion dropped almost
   50\% by the fifth year following treatment. Our results suggest that
   disturbances associated with restoration treatments can facilitate
   establishment of nonnative plants, however the post-treatment plant
   community was increasingly dominated by native species.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction of exotic plant species is confounding treatments designed
   to reduce unnaturally high tree densities in ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa P. \& C. Lawson) forests of the western United States. Also,
   the recent increase in large, stand-replacing wildfires may promote
   introduction and spread of species, such as diffuse knapweed (Centaurea
   diffusa Lam.), which may lead to reduced forage and land values and
   major ecosystem changes. We hypothesized that diffuse knapweed
   germination and seedling growth would respond positively to burned
   conditions in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. Our first field
   study was based on a May 2002 wildfire near Flagstaff, Arizona (Site I).
   For the field study at Site I, we buried diffuse knapweed seeds in
   sealed mesh packets in four forest floor conditions: severely burned,
   moderately burned, unburned bare soil and unburned. We removed packets
   monthly and measured percent germination. Germination under severely
   burned conditions at Site I (overall average 76\%) was higher than in
   unburned conditions (59\%) (P = 0.017). Our second field study was based
   on a fuel reduction treatment with slash piles burned in February 2003
   (Site H). Germination in seed packets was higher (P = 0.003) in pile
   burn scars (67\%) than in adjacent unburned locations (38\%) at Site II.
   In fall 2002, we planted knapweed seeds in pots containing intact `oil
   cores from Site I from unburned and severely burned conditions. We
   allowed competition to grow in half the pots, and removed competition in
   the other half. Diffuse knapweed biomass/pot was greater (P = 0.035) in
   soil from the severely burned (2.6 g) compared to the unburned condition
   (0.6 g) from Site I. Knapweed biornass/pot also appeared greater when
   grown in soil from pile burn scars (3.3 g) compared with unburned
   locations (2.5 g) from Site II, although the difference was not
   significant (P = 0.317). We conclude that severe wildfire or pile
   burning can promote germination and seedling growth of diffuse knapwecd
   in northern Arizona pine forests. Moreover, diffuse knapweed may also
   threaten unburned forests, as average germination was 48\% in unburned
   locations. Failure to consider exotic invasive species in fuel reduction
   and wildfire rehabilitation may result in trading one undesirable
   condition for another. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Giant rosette plant morphology as an indicator of recent fire history in
   Andean paramo grasslands}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{37-44}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{High-altitude Andean paramo grasslands are fire-dependent systems but
   reconstructing recent fire history is difficult using conventional
   approaches. From Venezuela to Ecuador, paramos are usually dominated by
   giant rosette plants of the genus Espeletia. This study assesses
   Espeletia's potential as an indicator of recent fire history. Their
   peculiar morphology is an adaptation to the mountain environment. Fire
   removes dead leaves which sheathe the single stem, but they begin to
   reaccumulate after the fire. It is this reaccumulation of leaves, plus
   post-fire mortality rates, that might indicate recent fire history.
   Adult mortality during the first two years after the fire varied
   according to fire intensity, from 8\% (low intensity) to 56\% (very high
   intensity), and was low in the absence of fire (2.5\%). Growth rates
   were much faster at 3600 m (14.8 cm y(-1)) than at 4100 m (1.6 cm
   y(-1)), and so was leaf turnover (94 compared with 50 leaves y(-1)).
   Taller plants grew faster than shorter ones. Dead leaf cover on the
   stems successfully predicted time since fire in four sites of known fire
   age. Espeletia does represent a useful indicator of fire history but
   requires calibration to account for local growth rates. At lower
   altitudes, Espeletia plants could provide information in fires during
   the previous 20 y, and longer periods at higher altitudes (where plants
   grow more slowly and live longer). It is a relatively cheap method that
   could be used to support a wide range of wider studies where recent fire
   history is influential. A protocol for calibrating the use of Espeletia
   as an indicator is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The sagebrush biome covers much of the western United States yet is at
   risk from ongoing disturbances. Physical disturbances such as fire often
   overcome the resistance of sagebrush communities to biological
   disturbances such as invasion by non-native species, but the impact of
   burn severity or combined disturbance types on sagebrush community
   composition remains unclear. We examined the relationship between native
   functional groups and non-native annual grass cover to the number of
   fires, burn severity, anthropogenic development, and vegetation
   treatments in northern Nevada, USA. We used Bureau of Land Management
   vegetation monitoring plots and existing climate, fire, and vegetation
   treatment databases to explore relationships using beta regression.
   After accounting for mean annual precipitation and temperature, and
   elevation, we quantified functional group mean cover related to levels
   of burn severity, numbers of fires, development, and vegetation
   treatments. Native herbaceous (grass and forb) groups were resilient to
   fire, but fire caused large declines in shrub and sagebrush cover.
   Non-native annual grass cover was associated with higher burn severity
   and the first fire at a site. We did not find evidence that post-fire
   restoration treatments were associated with increased native cover or
   decreased nonnative cover. However, shrub control and soil disturbing
   treatments (discing and chaining) were associated with decreased native
   perennial grass cover and increased non-native annual grass cover.
   Functional groups displayed varying patterns related to anthropogenic
   development and fire. For example, development had a larger impact on
   non-native cover at lower levels of burn severity, whereas forbs
   increased following fire only at lower levels of development. Although
   in some cases sagebrush communities showed resilience to disturbance,
   our results showed resistance to invasion by non-native annual grasses
   can be overcome by combinations of disturbances at lower levels or by
   severe events.}},

Volume = {{174}},

Abstract = {{In many fire-prone habitats around the world, natural fire regimes have
   shaped the evolution of the associated flora. Critical life history
   stages are often linked to fire in species that occur in these
   fire-prone habitats but many species are unstudied. We investigated
   seedling emergence patterns over time, after several fires in
   south-eastern Australia, for three obligate seeders in the Genus
   Leucopogon (Family Epacridaceae): L. setiger, L. esquamatus and L.
   exolasius. Fixed quadrats were monitored for 12 to 30 months for newly
   emerged seedlings, both after fire and in unburnt L. exolasius and L.
   esquamatus habitats. There was a flush of seedling emergence in the
   first year after fire for all three Leucopogon species, with smaller
   pulses recorded in subsequent years. Time elapsed between fire and the
   onset of emergence differed between fires, but not between Leucopogon
   species. Whatever the timing of the fire, seedling emergence was
   restricted to the late autumn and winter periods, coinciding with
   emergence in unburnt habitat. This contrasts with patterns of emergence
   previously reported for other taxa, and also in this study, where
   emergence of the Leucopogon species after fire was delayed compared with
   co-occurring species in other genera. Our results suggest that seasonal
   factors are important to the germination ecology of these species and
   that combinations of fire-related and seasonal factors are necessary to
   maximise germination. Rainfall has a non-seasonal pattern in the study
   region and seasonal emergence post-fire has not previously been
   recorded. The magnitude of delay to emergence of species with seasonal
   emergence patterns will be determined by the season of fire but not by a
   seasonal pattern of rainfall in the post-fire year. A shift of the peak
   fire season could increase this delay, possibly affecting plant
   population recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The Mountain Renosterveld vegetation of the Roggeveld is an escarpment
   type renosterveld showing strong karroid affinities. Fire plays an
   important role as a landscape scale disturbance that shapes plant
   communities in this vegetation type, however, post-fire succession has
   never before been documented for renosterveld vegetation. A study was
   therefore conducted in the northern Roggeveld to improve our
   understanding of the recovery of the vegetation following fire. The
   natural vegetation recovery was analysed using line transect data
   accumulated at five different sites over a ten year period. This paper
   reports on the post-fire vegetation trends with respect to changes in
   species composition, species richness, life form composition and life
   form richness. Vegetation cover began to re-establish within the first
   nine months following the fire, and remained at a high level from years
   3 to 10. At the first survey the species richness varied from 13 to 17
   species, with the highest species richness (14 to 31 species) generally
   encountered at each transect after three years. The highest Shannon
   index values were generally found within the first three years and the
   lowest Shannon index values were found in years 9 and 10. In all cases
   the Principal Co-ordinate Analysis ordinations of the species
   composition data indicated a clear separation in the species composition
   between the first two years (years 1 and 2) following the fire and the
   remaining years (year 3 to 10). This study also supports the `initial
   floristic composition' model of Egler (1954) in that all or the majority
   of species encountered during the succession were already present at the
   beginning of the recovery phase and there was a rapid re-establishment
   of the initial plant community. (C) 2010 SAAB. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ecosystem resilience to climate change is contingent on post-disturbance
   plant regeneration. Sparse gymnosperm regeneration has been documented
   in subalpine forests following recent wildfires and compounded
   disturbances, both of which are increasing. In the US Intermountain
   West, this may cause a shift to non-forest in some areas, but other
   forests may demonstrate adaptive resilience through increased quaking
   aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) dominance. However, this potential
   depends on ill-defined constraints of aspen sexual regeneration under
   current climate. We created an ensemble of species distribution models
   for aspen seedling distribution following severe wildfire to define
   constraints on establishment. We recorded P. tremuloides seedling
   locations across a post-fire, post-blowdown landscape. We used 3
   algorithms (Mahalanobis Typicalities, Multilayer Perceptron Artificial
   Neural Network, and MaxEnt) to create spatial distribution models for
   aspen seedlings and to define constraints. Each model performed with
   high accuracy and was incorporated into an ensemble model, which
   performed with the highest overall accuracy of all the models. Populus
   tremuloides seedling distribution is constrained primarily by proximity
   to unburned aspen forest and annual temperature ranges, and secondarily
   by light availability, summer precipitation, and fire severity. Based on
   model predictions and validation data, P. tremuloides seedling
   regeneration is viable throughout 54\% of the post-fire landscape, 97\%
   of which was previously conifer -dominated. Aspen are less susceptible
   to many climatically-sensitive disturbances (e.g. fire, beetle outbreak,
   wind disturbance), thus, aspen expansion represents an important
   adaptation to climate change. Continued aspen expansion into
   post-disturbance landscapes through sexual reproduction at the level
   suggested by these results would represent an important adaptation to
   climate change and would confer adaptive forest resilience by
   maintaining forest cover, but would also alter future disturbance
   regimes, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to examine whether or not specific tree species
   (Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides),
   their post-fire stand age, or their position in a successional pathway
   had any significant effect on the functional diversity of associated
   soil microbial communities in a typical mixed boreal forest ecosystem
   (Duck Mountain Provincial Forest, Manitoba, Canada). Multivariate
   analyses designed to identify significant biotic and/or abiotic
   variables associated with patterns of organic substrate utilization
   (assessed using the BIOLOG (TM) System) revealed the overall similarity
   in substrate utilization by the soil microbial communities. The five
   clusters identified differed mainly by their substrate-utilization value
   rather than by specific substrate utilization. Variability in community
   functional diversity was not strongly associated to tree species or
   post-fire stand age; however, redundancy analysis indicated a stronger
   association between substrate utilization and successional pathway and
   soil pH. For example, microbial communities associated with the
   relatively high pH soils of the P. tremuloides-P. glauca successional
   pathway, exhibited a greater degree of substrate utilization than those
   associated with the A banksiana-P. mariana successional pathway and more
   acidic soils. Differences in functional diversity specific to tree
   species were not observed and this may have reflected the mixed nature
   of the forest stands and of their heterogeneous forest floor. In a
   densely treed, mixed boreal forest ecosystem, great overlap in tree and
   understory species occur making it difficult to assign a definitive
   microbial community to any particular tree species. The presence of P.
   tremuloides in all stand types and post fire stand ages has probably
   contributed to the large amount of overlap in utilization profiles among
   soil samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires in the Colorado Front Range can trigger dramatic increases in

   increases is needed to predict the effects of future wildfires, estimate
   runoff and erosion risks front prescribed fires. and design effective
   post-fire rehabilitation treatments. The objective of this project was
   to determine whether runoff and sediment yields were significantly
   related to the site variables of burn severity, percent cover, soil
   water repellency. soil moisture, time since burning, and slope. To
   eliminate the variability due to natural rainfall events, we applied an
   artificial storm of approximately 80 mm h(-1) on 26 1 m(2) plots in the
   summer and fall of 2000, The plots were distributed among a June 2000
   wildfire, a November 1999 prescribed fire, and a July 1994 wildfire.
   For 23 of the 26 plots the ratio of runoff to rainfall exceeded 50\%.
   Nearly all sites exhibited strong natural or fire-induced water
   repellency, so the runoff ratios were only 15-30\% larger for the
   high-severity plots in the two more recent fires than for the unburned
   or low-severity plots, The two high-severity plots in the 1994 wildfire
   had very low runoff ratios., and this probably was due to the high soil
   moisture conditions at the time of the simulated rainfall and the
   resulting reduction in the natural water repellency. Sediment yields
   from the high-severity sites in the two more recent fires were 10-26
   times greater than the unburned and low-severity plots. The plots burned
   at high severity in 1994 yielded only slightly more sediment than the
   unburned plots. Percent ground cover explained 81\% of the variability
   in sediment yields, and the sediment yields from the plots in the 1994
   wildfire are consistent with the observed recovery in percent ground
   cover. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Question
   Does understory vegetation cover and richness decline along a gradient
   of increasing Juniperus virginiana midstory canopy cover and is that
   decline best correlated with litter accumulation?
   Location
   Cross Timbers Forest in Payne County, OK, USA.
   Methods
   We measured vegetation in forest gaps as well as forest areas without J.
   virginiana, at the inner and outer edge of J. virginiana canopies and
   near J. virginiana trunks (200 plots) and compared vegetation
   differences among location to light, litter, soil and microclimate
   variables.
   Results
   Species richness (11 spp m-2 to 6 spp m-2) and summer vegetation cover
   (53.3\% to 12.7\%) declined with proximity to trunks. Regression
   indicated that richness declines (R2=0.08) and cover (R2=0.18) were best
   correlated with J. virginiana litter accumulation. Partial canonical
   correspondence analysis (pCCA) revealed two strong canonical axes, one
   related to litter/light and another to cover of Quercus spp. versus J.
   virginiana. Tree seedlings and woody vines dominated near J. virginiana.
   Forbs, graminoids and Quercus spp. seedlings were more common in areas
   without J. virginiana.
   Conclusions
   Increasing J. virginiana and consequent litter additions alter
   understory biomass and composition and, through inhibiting Quercus spp.
   recruitment, may lead to changes in overstory composition. Decreases in
   herbaceous litter, which historically contributed to fuel accumulation,
   may have positive feedback effects on midstory encroachment by reducing
   the potential for prescribed burning.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent increases in fire frequency in North America have focused
   interest on potential effects on adjacent ecosystems, including streams.
   Headwaters could be particularly affected because of their high
   connectivity to riparian and downstream aquatic ecosystems through
   aquatic invertebrate drift and emergence.
   2. Headwater streams from replicated burned and control catchments were
   sampled in 2 years following an intense forest fire in northeastern
   Washington (U.S.A.). We compared differences in benthic, drift and
   emergent macroinvertebrate density, biomass and community composition
   between five burned and five unburned catchments (14-135 ha).
   There were significantly higher macroinvertebrate densities in burned
   than control sites for all sample types. Macroinvertebrate biomass was
   greater at burned sites only from emergence samples; in benthic and
   drift samples there was no significant difference between burn and
   control sites.
   4. For all sample types, diversity was lower in the burned catchments,
   and the macroinvertebrate community was dominated by chironomid midges.
   5. Compared to the effects of fire in less disturbed ecosystems, this
   study illustrated that forest fire in a managed forest may have greater
   effects on headwater macroinvertebrate communities, influencing prey
   flow to adjacent terrestrial and downstream aquatic habitats for at

Abstract = {{Careful evaluation of forest regeneration and vegetation recovery after
   a fire event provides vital information useful in land management. The
   use of remotely sensed data is considered to be especially suitable for
   monitoring ecosystem dynamics after fire. The aim of this work was to
   map post-fire forest regeneration and vegetation recovery on the
   Mediterranean island of Thasos by using a combination of very high
   spatial (VHS) resolution (QuickBird) and hyperspectral (EO-1 Hyperion)
   imagery and by employing object-based image analysis. More specifically,
   the work focused on (1) the separation and mapping of three major
   post-fire classes (forest regeneration, other vegetation recovery,
   unburned vegetation) existing within the fire perimeter, and (2) the
   differentiation and mapping of the two main forest regeneration classes,
   namely, Pinus brutia regeneration, and Pin us nigra regeneration. The
   data used in this study consisted of satellite images and field
   observations of homogeneous regenerated and revegetated areas. The
   methodology followed two main steps: a three-level image segmentation,
   and, a classification of the segmented images. The process resulted in
   the separation of classes related to the aforementioned objectives. The
   overall accuracy assessment revealed very promising results
   (approximately 83.7\% overall accuracy, with a Kappa Index of Agreement
   of 0.79). The achieved accuracy was 8\% higher when compared to the
   results reported in a previous work in which only the EO-1 Hyperion
   image was employed in order to map the same classes. Some classification
   confusions involving the classes of P. brutia regeneration and P. nigra
   regeneration were observed. This could be attributed to the absence of
   large and dense homogeneous areas of regenerated pine trees in the study
   area. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire can exert considerable influence on many watershed processes,
   including the partitioning of precipitation by forest canopies. Despite
   general acknowledgement that canopy interception is reduced following
   wildfire, effects on net rainfall and snow accumulation have not been
   quantified. The objectives of this study were to document net rainfall
   and snow water equivalent (SWE) in burned and unburned (reference)
   forest stands over a 10-year period to characterise the effects of
   severe wildfire on net precipitation in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.
   Differences in summer (June-September) rainfall between burned and
   reference stands suggest that wildfire reduced rainfall interception by
   65\%, resulting in a 48\% increase in net rainfall from 2006 to 2008.
   This represented an average annual increase in net rainfall of 122
   mm(36\%) for 10 years after the fire. Similarly, a burned stand had 152
   mm(78\%) higher mean annual peak SWE than a paired reference stand.
   Collectively, burned stands had 274 mm (191-344 mm; 51\%) more mean
   annual net precipitation for the first decade after fire. These results
   suggest that increases in net precipitation are likely following

Abstract = {{Our understanding of wildland fire effects on understory plant
   communities is limited because of a lack of repeated measurements before
   and after lightning-ignited fires. We examined vegetation responses to a
   surface fire in a ponderosa pine forest and a mixed-severity fire in a
   spruce-fir-aspen forest using before-after, control-impact (BACI) study
   designs. We hypothesized that the surface fire would stimulate plant
   species richness and minimally alter community composition, but that the
   mixed-severity fire would decrease richness and significantly alter
   composition. In ponderosa pine forests, total species richness and plant
   cover increased slightly because of annual and biennial forb and grass
   establishment in soils where duff layers were reduced by the surface
   fire. In spruce-fir-aspen forests, total species richness and plant
   cover were similar in burned and unburned forests after 2ayears,
   although annual and biennial forbs and graminoids increased
   significantly in the burned area. Plant community composition was
   altered by both fires. Wildfires may indirectly influence the understory
   plant community through the mediating effects of overstory basal area
   and litter depth. Fire effects on plant species richness and cover were
   weaker than effects due to environmental factors. Managers should

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Aims Post-fire succession in low-productivity ecosystems is rarely
   directly measured. We test whether taxonomic, functional, or baseline
   convergence has occurred 128 years after a major fire in 1890 in a
   low-productivity, fire-susceptible subalpine ecosystem. The historical
   plots represent one of the longest-running quantitative ecological
   studies in the world.
   Location Arthur's Pass, South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods We remeasured historical plots at sites established 42 years
   after the fire, and modernised previous chart quadrat data to percentage
   frequency. We tested whether taxonomic and functional dissimilarity
   within the site, and within environmentally similar transect groups,
   reduced over time. We used pollen data preserved in soil cores taken on
   the plots to test whether the site had returned to the reference
   pre-fire baseline.
   Results There is little evidence of taxonomic convergence across the
   site and dissimilarity remains high. Functional dissimilarity showed
   little reduction or evidence of convergence. Within maximally similar
   groups of transects, taxonomic and functional dissimilarity declined
   over time. Tree frequency increased significantly year-on-year. There is
   a lack of convergence with the pre-fire baseline, accompanied by a
   reduction in the proportion of tree pollen represented on most
   transects.
   Conclusions The taxonomic rate of successional change has yet to slow,
   and a steady state has yet to be reached, suggesting it is too early to
   consider the site has attained maximal convergence. Palaeoecological
   data have allowed quantification of the effect of a novel fire regime to
   which the ecosystems are poorly adapted: we found compositional,

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Understanding how a changing boreal fire regime is likely to influence
   regional climate requires detailed information about fire effects on the
   surface radiation budget. We used time series of satellite observations
   of surface albedo from 2000-2011 and fire perimeters since 1970 to study
   post-fire changes in surface net shortwave radiation along a latitudinal
   transect in central Canada. Fire-induced surface shortwave forcing (SSF)
   integrated over an annual cycle for the first 30 years after fire was
   similar (-4.1 W m(-2) with a 95\% confidence interval of -4.5 to -3.7 W
   m(-2)) between southern and northern boreal regions. The lack of a
   latitudinal difference in SSF was caused by counteracting latitudinal
   trends in seasonal contributions. Spring (March, April, and May) SSF
   increased with latitude, from -7.2 W m(-2) in the south to -10.1 W m(-2)
   in the north, primarily because of delayed snow melt, which amplified
   albedo differences between unburned forests and recovering stands. In
   contrast, winter incoming solar radiation and summer albedo change
   decreased from south to north, resulting in a decreasing latitudinal
   trend in winter and summer SSF. Vegetation recovery was slower in the
   north, leading to smaller increases in summer albedo during the first
   decade after fire, and a prolonged phase of elevated spring albedo
   during the second decade. Our results indicate that fires reduce surface
   net shortwave radiation considerably for many boreal forest ecosystems
   in North America, providing further evidence that disturbance-mediated
   shifts in surface energy exchange need to be considered in efforts to
   manage these forests for climate change mitigation. Citation: Jin, Y.,

Abstract = {{Nitrogen and phosphorus are the main elements limiting net primary
   production in terrestrial ecosystems. When growing in nutrient-poor
   soils, plants develop physiological mechanisms to conserve nutrients,
   such as reabsorbing elements from senescing foliage (i.e. nutrient
   retranslocation). We investigated the changes in soil N and P in
   post-fire succession in temperate rainforests of southern Chile. In this
   area, forest recovery often leads to spatially scattered, discrete
   regeneration with patches varying in age, area, species richness and
   tree cover, representing different degrees of recovery from disturbance.
   We hypothesized that soil nutrient concentrations should differ among
   tree regenerating patches depending on the progress of forest
   regeneration and that nutrient resorption should increase over time as
   colonizing trees respond to limited soil nutrients. To evaluate these
   hypotheses, we sampled 40 regeneration patches in an area of 5ha,
   spanning a broad range of vegetation complexity, and collected soil,
   tree foliage and litter samples to determine N and P concentrations.
   Nutrient concentrations in leaf litter were interpreted as nutrient
   resorption proficiency. We found that soil P was negatively correlated
   with all the indicators of successional progress, whereas total soil N
   was independent of the successional progress. Foliar N and P were
   unrelated to soil nutrient concentrations; however, litter N was
   negatively related to soil N, and litter P was positively related with
   soil P. Finally, foliar N:P ratios ranged from 16 to 25, which suggests
   that P limitation can hamper post-fire regeneration. We provide evidence
   that after human-induced fires, succession in temperate forests of Chile
   can become nutrient limited and that high nutrient retranslocation is a
   key nutrient conservation strategy for regenerating tree communities.}},

Title = {{Persistence of resprouting species after fire in natural and post-mine
   restored shrublands in southwestern Australia}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{451-458}},

Abstract = {{Questions
   Is post-fire persistence of resprouting species lower in restored sites,
   and is survival related to lignotuber size?
   Location
   Southwestern Australia, Eneabba, 300 km north of Perth.
   Methods
   Post-fire persistence of 10 lignotuberous shrub species was compared
   between three sites restored 8-24 years ago after mineral-sand mining
   and three surrounding natural shrubland sites (8-24 years since previous
   fire).
   Results
   Overall persistence of species was 11-93\% in restored sites (mean 52\%)
   and 79-100\% in natural sites (mean 96\%). Persistence increased with
   time since rehabilitation for five species with < 25\% of individuals in
   three species surviving in the youngest stand. For equivalent crown
   size, average lignotuber circumferences were 50\% smaller at restored
   sites and this probably accounted for their higher post-fire mortality.
   Apart from differences in the age of plants, restored sites had lower
   soil penetrability than natural sites, which may have restricted
   rootstock development. A tradeoff favoring a higher crown volume to
   lignotuber size ratio was apparent in nine of the ten species with
   greater crown volumes (by 37\%) and smaller lignotubers (by 36\%) in
   restored sites. Two resprouting species for which crown seed store was
   quantified had much higher fecundity in restored sites.
   Conclusions
   Fires reduced resprouter persistence in restored sites owing to poor
   development/insufficient size of lignotubers. Further management after
   fires is required, including application of resprouter seeds/seedlings
   on restored topsoil, transplanting adult resprouters (where viable) from
   natural areas ahead of the mining front. Low intensity/patchy fires are
   recommended on long unburnt sites. Resprouter survival would have likely
   been much greater in the first place if a deeper sandy soil profile was
   rehabilitated, thereby providing a more suitable medium for lignotuber
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Land management in tropical woodlands is being used to sequester carbon
   (C), alleviate poverty and protect biodiversity, among other benefits.
   Our objective was to determine how slash-and-burn agriculture affected
   vegetation and soil C stocks and biodiversity on an area of miombo
   woodland in Mozambique, and how C stocks and biodiversity responded once
   agriculture was abandoned. We sampled twenty-eight 0. 125 ha plots that
   had previously been cleared for subsistence agriculture and had been
   left to re-grow for 2 to similar to 25 years, and fourteen 0.25 ha plots
   of protected woodlands, recording stem diameter distributions and
   species, collecting wood for density determination, and soil from 0 to
   0.3 m for determination of \%C and bulk density. Clearance for
   agriculture reduced stem wood C stocks by 19.0 t C ha(-1). There were
   significant relationships between period of re-growth and basal area,
   stem numbers and stein biomass. During re-growth, wood C stocks
   accumulated at 0.7 t C ha(-1) year(-1). There was no significant
   difference in stem C stocks on woodlands and on abandoned farmland 20-30
   years old. Soil C stocks in the top 0.3 m on abandoned land had a
   narrower range (21-74 t C ha(-1)) than stocks in woodland soils (18-140
   t C ha(-1)). There was no discernible increase in soil C stocks with
   period of re-growth, suggesting that the rate of accumulation of organic
   matter in these soils was very slow. The re-growing plots did not
   contain the defining miombo species, and total stem numbers were
   significantly greater than in woodland plots, but species richness and
   diversity were similar in older abandonments and miombo woodlands. Wood
   C stocks on abandoned farmland were capable of recovery within 2-3
   decades, but soil C stocks did not change on this time-scale. Woodland
   soils were capable of storing > 100 t C ha(-1), whereas no soil on a
   re-growing area exceeded 74 t C ha(-1), so there is a potential for C
   sequestration in soils on abandoned farmland. Management should focus on
   identifying C-rich soils, conserving remaining woodlands to protect soil
   C and preserve defining miombo species, and on investigating whether
   fire control on recovering woodland can stimulate accumulation of soil C
   and greater tree biomass, and restore defining miombo species. (c) 2007

   fragment of a large post-fire area developed after a total fire of a
   Scots pine stand in the Notecka Forest. Soil samples were taken from
   three plots, which differed in methods of soil preparation applied prior
   to seedling planting: I - no-till treatment (holes dug with a shovel),
   11 - shallow ploughing with a disk plough, III - ploughing of furrows;-
   and in forest tree species used in artificial reforestation: P- pine
   (Pinus.silvestris) and A - gray alder (Alnus incana).
   The performed analysis showed that concentrations of heavy metals in the
   podzolic-rusty soils occurring on the examined plots reached a similar
   level to that observed in such soils unaffected by a fire. The recorded
   changes in quantities of analysed heavy metals depended mainly on soil
   horizons, whereas the effect of soil preparation as well as tree species
   used for reforestation was found to be less significant. Among chemical
   elements analysed in the study; the lowest value was recorded for
   cadmium (range: 0.27 - 0.60 mg kg(-1)) irrespective of the tree species
   and soil cultivation methods. The highest concentration of lead was

Abstract = {{Fine root (Fr) biomass, soil organic matter (SOM), and soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) stocks are affected by land

   in depletion of SOC and STN stocks. However, information on Fr biomass,

   to shifting cultivation lands is lacking and might be highly variable
   depending on the shifting cultivation system practiced. Swidden
   agriculture is the most complex and multifaceted form of agriculture in
   the world and it is a highly diverse land use system. It was expected
   that conversion of miombo woodlands to shifting cultivation lands would
   result in decreased Fr biomass, soil organic matter (SOM), and SOC and
   STN stocks as a result of the removal of the trees, soil burning, and
   other vegetation disturbances typical of this agricultural system. The
   results showed that the conversion of miombo woodlands to swidden
   agriculture lands did not impact SOM, SOC and STN stocks; however, it
   led to a loss of 52\% of Fr biomass. In miombo woodlands, Fr biomass and
   the soil properties (SOM, SOC, STN) were significantly dependent on
   basal area (m(2) ha(-1)). In swidden agriculture lands, they were
   dependent on stump cross-sectional area (m(2) ha(-1)). Shifting
   cultivation lands have the potential to store as much organic matter, C
   and N in the soil as miombo woodlands, depending on the form of shifting

   simplify tree species composition, and alter forest age structures and

Abstract = {{Forests of the Australian Alps (SE Australia) are considered some of the
   most vulnerable to climate change in the country, with ecosystem
   collapse considered likely for some due to frequent fire. It is not yet
   known, however, whether increasing fire frequency may stabilize due to
   reductions in flammability related to reduced time for fuel
   accumulation, show no trend, or increase due to positive feedbacks
   related to vegetation changes. To determine what these trends have been
   historically, dynamics were measured for 58years of mapped fire history.
   The 1.4 million ha forested area was divided into broad formations based
   on structure and dominant canopy trees, and dynamics were measured for
   each using flammability ratio, a modification of probability of ignition
   at a point. Crown fire likelihood was measured for each formation, based
   on satellite-derived measurements of the 2003 fire effects across a
   large part of the area. Contrary to popular perception but consistent
   with mechanistic expectations, all forests exhibited pronounced positive
   feedbacks. The strongest response was observed in tall, wet forests
   dominated by Ash-type eucalypts, where, despite a short period of low
   flammability following fire, post-disturbance stands have been more than
   eight times as likely to burn than have mature stands. The weakest
   feedbacks occurred in open forest, although post-disturbance forests
   were still 1.5 times as likely to burn as mature forests. Apart from
   low, dry open woodland where there was insufficient data to detect a
   trend, all forests were most likely to experience crown fire during
   their period of regeneration. The implications of this are significant
   for the Alps, as increasing fire frequency has the potential to
   accelerate by producing an increasingly flammable landscape. These
   effects may be semi-permanent in tall, wet forest, where frequent fire
   promotes ecosystem collapse into either the more flammable open forest
   formation, or to heathland.}},

Abstract = {{Management of rangelands has changed substantially over the past few
   decades; today there is greater emphasis on wildlife management and
   increased interest ill using natural disturbances such as fire to manage
   rangeland plant and animal communities. To determine the effect of
   prescribed fires on the distribution of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus), we used Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to monitor
   the movements of bucks and does during four, month-long, trials before
   and during the year after implementation of three late summer burns.
   Deer were expected to increase their use of burned areas to take
   advantage of fresh plant growth after the disturbance. However, the only
   increased use of burns occurred 1-2 months after treatment. The presence
   of cattle did not limit deer use of burns. Low use of burned areas was
   attributed to drought conditions, which limited vegetation regrowth.
   Other than a brief flush of fresh grass in autumn, no changes in plant
   cover could be ascribed to the burns. Thus, in semi-arid areas, use of
   prescribed burns to reduce brush cover and increase forb production for
   deer may not be successful, at least in the short-term, if lack of

Abstract = {{Modelled results of two popular fire severity measures NBRdiff and
   NDVIdiff were compared with field data for two small wildfires that
   occurred in eucalypt-dominated forest near Sydney, Australia during the
   spring of 2006. NBRdiff and NDVIdiff are computed by differencing
   specific spectral reflectance properties of satellite images captured
   before and after the fire event. In this case indices were derived from
   the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper platform. It is demonstrated that the
   spatial distribution of severity classes computed using NBRdiff were not
   statistically different to severity classes computed for NDVIdiff in the
   Tallowa fire, which was a `hot' burn. However, in the `cooler' Thirlmere
   Lakes fire, their respective classifications differed significantly.
   NBRdiff was clearly Superior to NDVIdiff in discriminating lower fire
   severities, which predominantly burn understorey vegetation whilst
   leaving the canopy un-scorched. It is also demonstrated using post-fire
   soil profiles from 50 sample sites that charring depth, which is related
   to the hydrophobic properties of the soil landscape, is significantly
   correlated to fire severity. This has important implications for the
   probability of developing a soil erosion risk model based on remotely
   sensed data, because in this environment, charred soil landscapes will
   have lost some of their naturally highly water repellent behaviour
   during burning, which in turn alters their susceptibility to overland
   flow development and surface wash erosion. Crown Copyright (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Vegetation cover in the Gran Sabana highlands (southern Venezuela)
   appears as a complex mosaic of tall to low forests, bush vegetation and
   savannas. In this study we described the changes in structure and
   floristic composition along a forest-savanna gradient consisted of tall
   forest (TF), medium forest (W), low forest (LF) and open savanna (S),
   and analyse the possible reasons for the observed changes. The results
   showed no obvious differences in the soils properties along the
   vegetation gradient. All sites presented shallow soils (<50 cm depth)
   with high percentage of sand and with dominance of quartz, kaolinite and
   oxides of iron and aluminum. The soil chemical characteristics were
   unfavorable and similar along the vegetation gradient. The major soil
   difference was related with the presence of an organic layer on the soil
   surface of TF and MF and their absence on the soils of LF and S.
   Abundant residues of large trees were found on the forest floor of TF,
   MF and LE These residues presented no signs of burning in TF, while in
   MF and particularly in LF were charred. This observation joined to the
   presence of charcoal within the mineral soil of S and the absence of the
   organic surface layer in LF and S indicated that fire has affected with
   different intensity or frequency the studied vegetation gradient. Large
   differences in the structure and floristic composition were found
   between TF, MF, LF and S. These differences could not be explained by
   changes in the mineralogical and chemical characteristics of the soil
   but only by fire which triggers the conversion. We concluded that the
   studied vegetation gradient represents stages in a temporal change from
   forest to savanna caused by fire, and this change has implied an
   impoverishment of tree species, a drastic reduction of biomass in terms
   of basal area, a drastic change of the floristic composition and the
   loss of the organic surface layer, which play an important role to
   maintain the fertility of these soils. (C) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Population size-structures, seed production, canopy seed storage
   (serotiny), and recruitment were investigated in relation to fire,
   drought and disease for a pair of co-occurring resprouting and
   non-sprouting shrub species from the genus Hakea (Proteaceae) in
   fire-prone Eucalyptus woodlands in western Victoria, Australia. The
   non-sprouter species, Hakea decurrens, showed faster height growth,
   higher seed production and higher seed viability than the resprouter,
   Hakea rostrata. Population size structures in stands up to 24 years
   since last fire showed no evidence of inter-fire recruitment for either
   species. Following a fire in 1990 in a mixed species stand 15-20 years
   old, the estimated number of viable seeds released from canopy-stored
   seed banks was approximately equal for both species. However, the rate
   of seedling establishment in the first year was about 10 times higher,
   and seedling suvivorship over the first 5 years was seven times higher,
   for the non-sprouter. Seedlings of Hakea decurrens and resprouts of
   Hakea rostrata began to produce seeds within three years of the last
   fire, while the few surviving seedlings of Hakea rostrata showed no
   evidence of reproductive maturity after six years. Inter-fire
   recruitment was recorded for the non-sprouter, Hakea decurrens, in the
   oldest stand (burned in 1967) between 24 and 28 years since last fire.
   This was associated with an increased rate of seed release from
   serotinous fruits due to the onset of high rates of adult plant
   mortality. High adult mortality and increased seed release correlated
   with increasing stand age, the occurrence of severe drought, and the
   likely presence of Phytophthora cinnamomi, a fungal pathogen which
   damages the root system, reducing water and nutrient uptake. There were
   no new recruits for the resprouter Hakea rostrata in this stand, but old
   plants continued to resprout from basal lignotubers and no mortality was
   observed. While recruitment of strongly serotinous shrub species is
   commonly described as being restricted to the immediate post-fire
   period, the present study illustrates that other events (e.g.,
   senescence, drought, disease) can lead to recruitment of serotinous
   non-sprouters and may be important in the maintenance of populations
   during unusually long periods without fire.}},

Abstract = {{Remote ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests on the North Rim of
   Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA provide valuable examples of
   reference conditions due to their relatively uninterrupted fire regimes,
   limited grazing history, and protection from logging. Wildfire is an
   important disturbance agent in upland forests of the Interior West, yet
   repeated measurements taken before and after lightning-ignited fires are
   rare. In 1999, a low-severity Wildland Fire Use fire burned 156 ha on
   Fire Point, a peninsula dominated by old-growth ponderosa pines, which
   had not burned for at least 76 years. We measured understory plant
   community and forest floor characteristics in 1998 (1 year before the
   fire) and 2001 (2 years after the fire) at this site and at nearby
   reference sites that did not burn in 1999 but have had continuing fire
   regimes throughout the past century. After the wildfire, the plant
   community at Fire Point shifted toward higher compositional similarity
   with the reference sites. Analysis of functional group composition
   indicated that this change was due primarily to an increase in annual
   and biennial forbs. Gayophytum diffusum, Polygonum douglasii,
   Chenopodium spp., Solidago spp., Elymus elymoides, Calochortus
   nuttallii, Hesperostipa comata, and Lotus spp. were indicative of
   forests influenced by recent fires. Species richness, plant cover, plant
   layer density and plant diversity were significantly lower at Fire Point
   than at the reference sites, possibly due to long-term fire exclusion,
   but the fire did not increase the rate of change in these variables
   after 2 years. Few exotic species were present at any site. Forest floor
   depths at Fire Point were reduced to depths similar to the reference
   sites, primarily due to consumption of the duff layer. There was a
   significant inverse relationship between the ratio of duff:litter and
   species richness. Compared to fire-excluded forests, old-growth
   ponderosa pine forests influenced by low-intensity surface fires
   generally have greater plant species richness (especially annual forbs)
   and lighter fuel loads. This study supports the continued application of
   the Wildland Fire Use strategy in old-growth montane forests to maintain
   and improve forest health by altering understory species composition and
   reducing fuel loads. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As climate rapidly warms at high-latitudes, the boreal forest faces the
   simultaneous threats of increasing invasive plant abundances and
   increasing area burned by wildfire. Highly flammable and widespread
   black spruce (Picea mariana) forest represents a boreal habitat that may
   be increasingly susceptible to non-native plant invasion. This study
   assess the role of burn severity, site moisture and time elapsed since
   burning in determining the invisibility of black spruce forests. We
   conducted field surveys for presence of non-native plants at 99 burned
   black spruce forest sites burned in 2004 in three regions of interior
   Alaska that spanned a gradient of burn severities and site moisture
   levels, and a chronosequence of sites in a single region that had burned
   in 1987, 1994, and 1999. We also conducted a greenhouse experiment where
   we grew invasive plants in vegetation and soil cores taken from a subset
   of these sites. In both our field survey and the greenhouse experiment,
   regional differences in soils and vegetation between burn complexes
   outweighed local burn severity or site moisture in determining the
   invasibility of burned black spruce sites. In the greenhouse experiments
   using cores from the 2004 burns, we found that the invasive focal
   species grew better in cores with soil and vegetation properties
   characteristic of low severity burns. Invasive plant growth in the
   greenhouse was greater in cores from the chronosequence burns with
   higher soil water holding capacity or lower native vascular biomass. We
   concluded that there are differences in susceptibility to non-native
   plant invasions between different regions of boreal Alaska based on
   native species regeneration. Re-establishment of native ground cover
   vegetation, including rapidly colonizing bryophytes, appear to offer
   burned areas a level of resistance to invasive plant establishment.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the hypothesis that the impacts of human disturbances like
   logging on forest biodiversity will be minimised if there is close
   congruence with the effects of natural disturbances (e.g. wildfire). The
   montane ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria (south-eastern
   Australia) are used as a case study to examine several themes associated
   with congruence between natural (wildfire) and human disturbance
   (clearfell logging) regimes. These themes include: (1) the types of
   biological legacies left or created following wildfires and their use as
   habitat components by vertebrates, (2) the use of biological legacies to
   reconstruct pre-European stand structural conditions, (3) contrasts
   between stand and landscape conditions created by wildfire and
   clearfelling, and 4) approaches to create greater consistency between
   the effects of wildfire and logging at the stand and landscape levels.
   Extensive empirical studies reveal major differences between clearfelled
   forests and those burned by wildfires, particularly with respect to
   vegetation structure, plant species composition, and landscape
   patchiness. Clearfelling simplifies stand structure and creates a single
   cohort of regrowth trees. In contrast, natural disturbance by wildfire
   varies in its intensity and has variable effects-all trees are killed in
   some stands and large dead trees remain. In others a multi-aged stand
   develops which is a mixture of fire-damaged living and dead trees. Many
   of the biological legacies typical of stands damaged by wildfires are
   also those which axe severely depleted in young clearfelled forest.
   Differences between burned and clearfelled forests can have significant
   negative impacts for many forest-dependent vertebrates. The widespread
   application of clearfelling operations is not consistent with the
   effects of natural disturbance regimes. This suggests there is a need to
   change cutting and regeneration methods to more closely resemble natural
   disturbance regimes and promote structural complexity in stands of
   harvested forest to enhance their value for wildlife. Such changed
   silvicultural systems should lead to: 1) the retention of more living
   and dead trees that remain standing through several cutting events and
   eventually develop cavities, (2) the protection of intact thickets of
   logging- sensitive understorey vegetation, (3) the recruitment of more
   large logs to the forest floor, (4) longer rotation times more akin with
   the natural life cycle of montane ash stands, and (5) the creation of
   more stands of truly multi-aged forest. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{A key issue for forest and rangeland health and productivity in eastern

   introductions were accidental, many were intentional for wildlife
   habitat improvement, ornamental purposes, wood or fiber production, soil
   conservation, livestock forage production, or other crop uses. Exotic
   species, or weeds, can be a significant component of global
   environmental change because of their potential to alter primary
   productivity, decomposition, hydrology, nutrient cycling, and natural
   disturbance regimes. At smaller scales, they alter the structure,
   composition, and successional pathways of ecosystems. They lower
   diversity by out-competing native plants. Disturbance caused by forest
   restoration activities (thinning and prescribed fire) can promote weed
   spread, but ultimately will improve native plant diversity and
   productivity, improving ecosystem resistance to weed invasion.
   Restoration strategies need to include consideration of weed prevention
   and control and restoration of natives. Prevention includes restoring
   ecosystem processes; control includes biological, manual, mechanical,
   herbicidal, and prescribed burning methods; restoration involves
   returning native plants to a site. Monitoring is important to provide

Abstract = {{Interactions at multiple scales can shape how forest ecosystems respond
   to both climate change and disturbance. At landscape scales, feedbacks
   cause vegetation and wildfire regimes to alter one another, while forest
   patterns at local scales can result from feedbacks between plants and
   their abiotic environment. Consequently, disturbances and abiotic
   changes may give rise to forest patterns that further affect processes
   like wildfire. Examples may exist in the history of subalpine ribbon
   forests, which are alternating areas of forest and meadow where snow
   drifting and linear bands of trees depend upon each other. Just as
   ongoing climate changes may change snow levels and the dynamics in these
   forests, past climate changes and wildfires may have generated the
   conditions suitable for ribbon forests. To examine feedbacks in
   subalpine forests and the potential that climate changes and fires gave
   rise to ribbon forests, we obtained six fossil pollen records from a
   subalpine landscape in Colorado. Forests there may have responded to
   climate change and widespread wildfires similar to 1,000 years ago when
   >80\% of sites on the landscape burned within a century. The fires
   coincided with regional warming, but the extent of burning declined
   before the climate cooled, possibly driven by changes in fuel structure
   and composition. The pollen records indicate that large vegetation
   changes coincided with the widespread wildfires at five of the six
   sites. Pollen assemblages consistent with ribbon forests first became
   important at this time as sagebrush (Artemisia) and other meadow taxa
   increased and conifers, especially spruce (Picea) declined. The ribbon
   forests emerged as novel fuel breaks at the time when temperatures rose
   similar to 0.5 degrees C but the number of sites burned per century
   declined. Cooling during the Little Ice Age then expanded the openings
   and extent of ribbon forests, probably helping to reduce the frequency
   of fires across our sites to its minimum. Synthesis. The rise of ribbon
   forests in northern Colorado illustrates how climate and fire can
   interact to rapidly transform landscapes and disturbance regimes. The
   interactions can produce forest patterns with unexpected consequences
   such as reduced wildfire despite regional warming.}},

   soils present higher SOM contents than their unburnt counterparts. This
   could be attributed to an important reaccumulation of fresh vegetal
   material, which is probably a consequence of the decrease of SOM
   decomposition rates after fire. Moreover, charred organic compounds are
   not found in all the burnt soils, which could be due to the long time

Abstract = {{Successfully managing wetlands requires monitoring changes in plant

   evaluate wetland vegetation management between 1998 and 2010. We
   conducted our study at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge wetlands,
   which are located on the northeastern arm of the Great Salt Lake in
   northern Utah. We acquired high-resolution airborne multispectral
   imagery of the refuge in 1992 and 2010 to quantify changes in vegetation
   cover over time. We produced classified vegetation maps for the years
   1992 and 2010 to calculate vegetation and water cover in management
   units. Classification results indicate that invasive vegetation is fast
   replacing native species in areas adjacent to the water delivery canals.
   We also compared vegetation changes to historical data provided by
   refuge managers, and these data contained information about the
   management activities undertaken in the wetland units over the study
   period. We found that the managers' efforts to control the expansion of
   invasive species such as keeping the units full of water throughout the
   yeas; adjusting water depth to manage salinity levels and aquatic
   vegetation, and undertaking burning or mechanical disturbance when
   needed were successful in most of the units, although some units were
   still invaded by undesirable plants. Here we demonstrate how wetland
   managers can use remote sensing and historical data of vegetation cover
   to understand which native plant species are most susceptible to
   replacement by invasive species, how vegetation responds to management
   actions, and ultimately how managers can promote diverse plant

Abstract = {{The prolonged absence of fire in Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana)
   woodlands and savannas of the Pacific Northwest has resulted in

   girdling treatments to kill Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) over the
   past two decades with the objective of recovering remnant oaks and

   (axe or chainsaw). Larger trees with a low girdle width-to-tree diameter
   ratio tended to survive girdling. Trees with a girdle width-to-tree
   diameter ratio >= 1 were most effective at killing trees. Snags

   observed on 19\% of snags across the chronosequence but 88\% of 10 y old
   snags had signs of bird foraging. Fine woody fuel loading and fuelbed
   depths were potentially elevated 7 years after treatment but did not
   persist through the time period examined. Regeneration of Douglas-fir
   and oaks were highly variable and did not seem to be clearly linked to
   girdling activity. Our results indicate that girdling is a highly
   effective treatment to kill Douglas-fir and aid restoration of Oregon
   oak woodlands with limited negative impacts on surface fuel hazards or

Abstract = {{Post-fire seedling establishment in relation to microsite conditions and
   relationships of seedlings (saplings) to older tree individuals was
   studied in two treatments (i.e., burned and unburned sites) in an area
   known as the pitch pine (Pinus rigida) ridge on Hill Island, St.
   Lawrence Islands National Park, Eastern Ontario. Pinus rigida is a rare
   tree species in Canada at the northern limit of its range. Pinus strobus
   (eastern white pine) and Quercus alba (white oak) are also common
   species of the site. The negative correlation between density of mature
   R rigida trees and total canopy cover and hardwood density was confirmed
   in unburned plots on the ridge. On the other hand, P strobus density was
   positively correlated with those parameters. The density of R rigida
   seedlings is higher (by 48\%) and P. strobus seedlings lower (by 82\%)
   in burned plots than in unburned plots. Seedling recruitment was also
   dependent on the occurrence of seed trees of both species. The density
   of P. strobus seedlings was generally higher than that of P. rigida
   seedlings, especially in unburned plots. The long absence of fire, high
   seed production of P. Strobus, and relatively low number of R rigida
   seed-producing trees, which have a low amount of fertile cones, are
   probably the main factors influencing seedling recruitment on the ridge.
   Discriminant analysis confirmed different seedbed requirements of both
   species. Pinus strobus seedlings occurred within both treatments,
   especially on deeper soil profiles with thicker litter depth, although,
   for seed regeneration, a mineral soil seedbed or a greatly reduced
   organic layer was also important. Pinus rigida seedling recruitment on
   burned and unburned plots was comparatively higher on mineral soil,
   thinner litter layer, and moss and lichen cushions.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed and applied a process-based model, the Wetland
   Ecosystem Model (WEM), to evaluate the effects of a prescribed fire on
   the phosphorus (P) dynamics and cattail (Typha domingensis) growth in a
   P-enriched area in the Florida Everglades. The WEM couples major
   ecosystem processes including carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and P
   biogeochemical cycles, plant growth, hydrology, and fire disturbance.
   The model is used to assess the effects of a prescribed fire on P
   dynamics and cattail growth through dynamic interaction among four
   modules: fire, water chemistry, soil, and vegetation. The simulation
   results are in agreement with observed data including cattail above- and
   belowground biomass and dead mass, P concentration in surface-water,
   pore-water, and soil, and soil and water temperature. Cattail
   above-ground biomass reached the unburned level one year after burn;
   belowground biomass recovered to unburned level one and half years after
   the fire, however, dead mass did not completely reach unburned level two
   years after fires. The fire increased water and soil temperatures in the
   short term, while indirectly increasing the sensitivity of water and
   soil temperature post-fire response to air temperature by altering the
   energy exchange between air and water through a canopy gap created by
   fire. The fire also altered the P dynamics in surface-water and
   pore-water. A post-fire P pulse that lasted for less than one month was
   observed in surface-water. A similar P pulse, but in a small magnitude
   and a longer duration, was also observed in the pore-water total
   phosphorus (TP), and then came back to normal level after approximately
   three months. No significant changes in soil TP was observed during the
   study period. Meanwhile, no significant changes in water nutrients were
   observed downstream of the study plot. This finding indicated that the
   P-enriched wetlands in Everglades act as a buffer in regulating the P
   concentration in surface-water. Our study showed that the distance of
   fire effects on a 300 m x 300 m plot was less than 300 m downstream.
   Sensitivity analysis identified that the air temperature and
   hydrological conditions are two important driving factors which may
   alter the cattail community dynamics in response to prescribed fires.
   Similar to the filed studies, this study provided evidences that fire
   played an important role in managing plant growth and P dynamics in the
   Florida Everglades. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forest restoration treatments seek to increase resilience to wildfire

   The extent and intensity of treatments are often constrained by

   trade-offs of addressing different management goals. The recent
   (2012-15) extreme drought in California, USA, resulted in widespread
   tree mortality, particularly in the southern Sierra Nevada, and provided
   an opportunity to assess the effects of restoration treatments on forest
   resilience to drought. We assessed changes in mixed-conifer forest
   structure following thinning and understorey burning at the Kings River
   Experimental Watersheds in the southern Sierra Nevada, and how
   treatments, topography and forest structure related to tree mortality in
   the recent drought. Treatments had negligible effect on basal area, tree
   density and canopy cover. Following the recent drought, average basal
   area mortality within the watersheds ranged from 5 to 26\% across
   riparian areas and 12 to 44\% across upland areas, with a range of 0 to
   95\% across all plots. Tree mortality was not significantly influenced
   by restoration treatments or topography. Our results suggest that the
   constraints common to many restoration treatments may limit their
   ability to mitigate the impacts of severe drought.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is the predominant natural disturbance that influences the
   community structure as well as ecosystem function in forests. This study
   was conducted to examine the soil properties, loss of aboveground
   biomass, and understory plant community in response to an anthropogenic
   fire in a coniferous (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) and broadleaf (Quercus
   acutissima Carruth.) mixed forest in a subtropical-temperate climatic
   transition zone in Central China. The results showed that soil pH,
   NO3--N concentration, and microbial biomass carbon (C) increased three
   months after the fire; however, there were no significant differences in
   soil organic C, total nitrogen (N), NH4+-N concentration, or microbial
   biomass N between the burned and unburned observed plots. The total
   aboveground biomass was 39.0\% lower in the burned than unburned plots
   four weeks after fire. Direct biomass combustion (19.15 t ha(-1),
   including understory shrubs and litters) was lower than dead wood
   biomass loss (23.69 t ha(-1)) caused by the fire. The declining trends
   of tree mortality with increasing diameter at breast height for both
   pine and oak trees suggest that small trees are more likely to die
   during and after fires due to the thinner bark of small trees and tree
   and branch fall. In addition, burning significantly stimulated the
   density of shrub (160.9\%) and herb (88.0\%), but it also affected the
   richness of shrub and herb compared with that in the unburned plots two
   months after the fire. The rapid recovery of understory plants after
   fires suggest that the diversity of understory species could benefit
   from low-severity fires. Our findings highlight that the decomposition
   of dead wood and understory community recovery should be considered for
   offsetting C emissions after fires for further research.}},

   density. The study was undertaken near Brasilia, Brazil, from 1999 to
   2001. Soil water content was measured with a neutron probe in three

   from fire for more than 30 years and, as a consequence, has a high
   density of woody plants. The other site had been frequently burned, and
   has a high herbaceous vegetation density and less woody vegetation.
   Soil water uptake patterns were strongly seasonal, and despite
   similarities in hydrological processes, the protected area
   systematically used more water than the burned area. Three temporarily
   contiguous patterns of water absorption were differentiated,
   characterized by variation in the soil depth from which water was
   extracted. In the early dry season, vegetation used water from
   throughout the soil profile but with a slight preference for water in
   the upper soil layers. Toward the peak of the dry season, vegetation had
   used most or all available water from the surface to a depth of 1.7 m,
   but continued to extract water from greater depths. Following the first
   rains, all water used was from the recently wetted upper soil layers
   only. Evaporation rates were a linear function of soil water
   availability, indicating a strong coupling of atmospheric water demand

   Non-linear stochastic optimisation was used to find the optimal stand

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},

Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{634-646}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Pinus nigra Arn. forests dominated over extensive areas of the
   Northern Iberian Plateau (Spain) during the Holocene, but a strong
   decline during the historical period (c. 1300-700 cal. BP) led to the
   present fragmented populations. This demise has been generally
   attributed to land-use changes or climate, but the specific roles of
   disturbance regimes such as fire variability and grazing on the
   long-term are not fully understood yet.
   2. We combine multi-proxy palaeoecological data (fossil pollen, spores,
   conifer stomata, microscopic and macroscopic charcoal) together with
   quantitative analyses (ordination and peak detection) from a
   high-resolution sedimentary sequence (Tubilla del Lago, 900 m a.s.l.) to
   assess the causes of pine forests demise. A new microscopic charcoal
   record from an additional sequence (Espinosa de Cerrato, 885 m a.s.l.)
   is used to assess burning and pine decline at a more regional (100-km
   radius) scale.
   3. Pinus nigra forests could cope with drought and fire regime
   variability (FRI = 110-500 years), with forest recovery taking c.
   100-200 years after fires. Only at 1300-1200 cal. BP a long-lasting
   irrecoverable demise of P. nigra forests occurred when human-induced
   fires together with arable and pastoral farming became widespread in the
   area. Subsequently, Quercus woodlands expanded in the remnant patchy
   pinewoods. This vegetation shift was primarily caused by three
   particularly important fire episodes in less than a century (c.
   1300-1200 cal. BP).
   4. Synthesis. Pinus nigra forests have shown a millennial resilience to
   the natural fire regime of the Northern Iberian Plateau that was
   characterized by relatively frequent small-moderate fires and rare
   high-intensity fires. However, frequent human-caused crown fires and the
   onset of intensive farming caused their demise over an extensive area.
   Ongoing land-use abandonment in the Iberian mountains could promote the
   occurrence of high-intensity, severe fires due to the rapid build-up of
   high fuel loads. Forest management could mimic the natural fire regime
   by periodically reducing fuel loads for a transitional period until
   natural disturbance variability is fully restored, thus preserving these
   relict native plant communities.}},

Number = {{489}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The immediate, visible impacts of forest fires can vary from partial
   consumption of the surface litter and minimal plant charring to high
   consumption of all fuel classes and complete mortality of large stands
   of trees. When fire passes through a stand, trees can be killed outright
   if all or a large portion of the foliage, buds, and branches are killed,
   or they can be mortally wounded if a smaller portion of the living
   tissue is killed. Trees in this latter group will die over several years
   subsequent to the fire with the mortality rate generally decreasing over
   time. Another category includes trees whose vigor has been reduced by
   fire injury, thereby permitting successful insect and disease attacks,
   which commonly result in tree death.
   Standing dead trees have distinctly different influences on ecosystems
   than living trees do. In the first half of this century, snags were
   primarily thought of as fire hazards (Dahms 1949; Keen 1955). Management
   activities at that time included felling dead trees in timber sales and
   along roads. More recently, managers have realized the economic and
   ecological value of snags. Products with direct economic value include
   house logs, firewood, and even lumber (Lyon 1977). As decay spreads
   within the tree, these values diminish and are generally lost when the
   tree falls.
   Apart from economics is the value of standing dead trees for wildlife
   habitat. Birds use such trees to perch, feed, nest, overwinter, and hide
   (Bull 1978). Mammals also use snags to nest or den, feed, and
   overwinter. The value of dead trees for habitat dramatically changes
   when standing trees become fallen logs because bird nest and perch use
   is greatly reduced. These logs, however, are important for hiding and
   thermal cover, feeding, and nesting for ground birds (grouse) and small
   mammals (rabbits and squirrels) (Thomas and others 1979). As they decay,
   logs also ameliorate soil moisture and nutrient condition for plant
   growth (Harvey and others 1988).
   Dead trees are also an important forest fuel. They ignite more easily
   than live trees and, therefore, represent a higher potential source of
   burning embers that can aid wildfire spread. After falling, logs
   represent a potentially high concentrated heat source causing problems
   for fire suppression and sometimes resulting in microsite soil
   degradation.
   Knowledge of the transition rate from standing dead trees to fallen logs
   would be important for those who manage timber and soil resources,
   wildlife habitat, and wildland fuels. Others have reported on the fall
   rate of beetle-killed ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) (Keen 1955;
   Schmid and others 1985), beetle- and fire-killed Jeffrey pine (Pinus
   jeffreyi) and white fir (Abies concolor) (Raphael and Morrison 1987),
   and fire-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) (Lyon 1984).
   This study describes 10 year fall rates of second-growth ponderosa pine
   following mortality from different levels of crown scorch sustained in
   different seasons of prescribed burns.}},

   composition. The processes driving BB in boreal forests varied from one
   region to another during the Holocene. However, general trends in boreal
   biomass burning were primarily controlled by changes in climate (mean
   annual precipitation in Alaska, northern Quebec, and northern
   Fennoscandia, and mean July/summer temperature in central Canada and
   central Fennoscandia) and, secondarily, by fuel composition (BB
   positively correlated with the presence of boreal needleleaf evergreen
   trees in Alaska and in central and southern Fennoscandia). Land use
   played only a marginal role. A modification towards less flammable tree
   species (by promoting deciduous stands over fire-prone conifers) could
   contribute to reduce circumboreal wildfire risk in future warmer
   periods.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the soil organic-N forms and their bio-availability was
   studied in a N-15 labelled and burnt soil (BLS) after two successive
   reclamation steps under greenhouse conditions: a 3-month growing period
   of Lolium, without (BLS-L) or with poultry manure addition (4 and 8 Mg
   ha(-1): BLS+PM4-L and BLS+PM9-L), followed by a 12-month growing phase
   of pine seedlings (BLS-P, BLS+PM4-P and BLS+PM8-P). The results were
   compared with those obtained for the homologous labelled unburnt soil
   (LS, LS-L and LS-P) to evaluate the efficacy of these reclamation
   techniques in the mitigation of the drastic post-fire changes exhibited
   by the major biologically available N pool in terrestrial ecosystems:
   the soil organic N. The significant and steady decrease of the N-15
   enrichment observed in the unburnt soil during the successive plant
   growth cycles (LS > LS-L > LS-P) contrasts with the lack of significant
   changes, in both the content of total organic N-15 and the atom \% N-15
   in excess, among the treatments with the burnt soil (BLS > BLS-L BLS-P).
   These results showed that: a) in LS, N mineralization proceeds faster
   for the recently incorporated N (N-15 enriched) than for the native N,
   supplying the growing vegetation with inorganic N more N-15 enriched
   than the bulk soil N; and b) in BLS, soil combustion has reduced the
   usually higher biological availability of the recently added N to levels
   similar to those of the endogenous N.
   The re-vegetation with Lolium and Pinus and the addition of poultry
   manure mitigated the high differences observed in the size of the amino
   acid and the organic derived NH4+-N pools due to the combustion process,
   which are usual between burnt and unburnt soils. Conversely, these burnt
   soil reclamation techniques (re-vegetation and poultry manure addition),
   even jointly used, were unable to reduce the huge differences observed
   between the burnt and the unburnt soils for the other N fractions
   considered (amides, amino sugars, hydrolysable unidentified-N,
   hydrolysable organic N and un-hydrolysable N) that accounted for more
   than 80\% of the soil organic N. Consequently, it seems that without the
   introduction of N-2-fixing microorganisms or plants in the burnt soils
   the recovery of the natural soil organic N composition will take place
   slowly. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disturbances may cause a temporary reduction or elimination of
   the protective effect of forests. The management of protection forests
   aims to influence forest dynamics to ensure an optimal and continuous
   protective effect. To achieve this goal quantitative and detailed
   information about the post disturbance stand dynamics is needed. In the
   case of hillslopes prone to shallow landslides in particular, there is a
   lack of knowledge about the effect of fire on the dynamic of root
   reinforcement and on the related increment in landslide risk. Such
   quantitative information is of paramount importance when dealing with
   forest system engineering resilience after disturbances.
   The objective of this work is to quantify the temporal and spatial
   dynamics of root reinforcement in a burnt Scots pine (Pinus silvestris)
   forest 4 years after a stand replacing fire in Switzerland. To this
   purpose, we compare the contribution of root reinforcement to soil
   strength of a burnt forest patch with a nearby-located, similar mature
   and healthy, stand. Root distribution measurements and field pullout
   tests on roots were used to calculate the spatial distribution of root
   reinforcement in both types of stand.
   The results show a reduction by a factor of 3.6 in root reinforcement 4
   years after the forest fire due to the degradation of the root
   mechanical properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that at this post-fire
   stage the natural regeneration is not able to counterbalance the
   protective function loss in term of root reinforcement. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Frequent-fire forests were historically characterized by lower tree
   density, a higher proportion of pine species, and greater within-stand
   spatial variability, compared to many contemporary forests where fire
   has been excluded. As a result, such forests are now increasingly
   unstable, prone to uncharacteristically severe wildfire or high levels
   of tree mortality in times of drought stress. While reducing tree
   density might help to restore resilience, thinning treatments are
   frequently seen as conflicting with management for other resources such
   as wildlife habitat, in part because standard thinning prescriptions
   don't typically produce the degree of within stand heterogeneity found
   in historical forests. In this study, we compare stand structures and
   heterogeneity produced by two different mechanical thinning treatments
   and in an unthinned control, all with or without prescribed fire as a
   follow-up treatment. The ``high variability{''} thinning treatment was
   designed to produce the spatial variability once found in frequent fire
   forests and was based on historical data from nearby old-growth stands,
   while the ``low variability{''} thinning treatment retained a similar
   number of trees but at a relatively even crown spacing. Stand averages
   and degree of variation for common forest metrics were calculated and
   values compared to a historical old-growth reference stand. Both
   thinning treatments reduced tree density and basal area, and shifted
   species composition towards historical values. Thinning treatments
   contained a deficit of trees in both the smallest (< 25 cm) and largest
   (> 80 cm) size classes, relative to historical conditions. The high
   variability thinning treatment increased forest structure variation more
   than the low variability thinning treatment for most measures and
   retained a broader distribution of canopy closure values across the
   treatment units. While prescribed fire also reduced stand density and
   increased the amount of within-stand heterogeneity (when delayed
   mortality was included), the magnitude was much less than that produced
   by thinning. Prescribed fire did not significantly reduce basal area or
   alter the species composition. Prescribed burning did significantly
   reduce surface fuel loads, while thinning alone had no effect for most
   fuel classes. Our results show that high variability thinning coupled
   with prescribed burning resulted in a forest better aligned with the
   conditions present in historical frequent-fire forests, which were known
   to be more resilient to both wildfire and drought.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition of the importance of ecologically
   sustainable forest management, including forest biodiversity
   conservation. Knowledge of the effects of forest practices on flora
   values can be gained by comparing the floristics of natural and
   harvested forest stands at the same stage of development. This paper
   presents the results from a comparative study of natural and managed
   forest regeneration in Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell dominated forests in
   the Victorian Central Highlands. The vascular floristics about a decade
   after clear-fell harvesting operations differed significantly from the
   floristics of similarly aged forest regenerating after wildfire. In
   clear-felled areas, weed and sedge species occurred more frequently than
   on wildfire sites and Acacia dealbata Link was much more abundant,
   whereas resprouting shrubs, tree ferns and most ground-fern species were
   more abundant in wildfire regeneration. The low survival rate of
   resprouting species reported in an increasing number of studies suggests
   that soil disturbance is likely to be a major contributor to
   differences.
   The floristics of sites burned by intense wildfire differed
   significantly from those subjected to less intense wildfire, indicating
   that considerable variation in floristics can occur under a natural
   disturbance regime. The failure of the clear-fell regeneration to fit
   within this broad natural variability suggests that clear-fell
   harvesting alters the natural regeneration processes. As species
   composition in these forests is largely determined by the initial
   floristic composition after disturbance, this paper provides evidence
   that some clear-felled regrowth forests may remain different in
   structure and composition to forests regenerating after natural
   disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{First flushes can be crucial to sediment transport in fluvial systems of
   drylands, as temporary streams are a characteristic feature of
   Mediterranean basins. After a wildfire, storm flows may enhance runoff
   delivery to channels, so increasing the first-flush effect. Cs-137 and
   Pb-210(ex) were used as tracers for recognizing the first post-fire
   flush effect on the source ascription of bed sediments temporarily
   stored in a Mediterranean temporary stream severely affected by a
   wildfire.
   Thirty sediment source samples were collected along one of the
   tributaries of a catchment (4.8 km(2)) located in Mallorca during a
   field campaign some weeks after the wildfire. The sample collection took
   into account effects of the wildfire and distinguished between soil
   surface and channel bank. To measure the source contribution temporarily
   stored with the bed sediment, five sediment samples-deposited during the
   first storm, occurring 3 months after the wildfire-were collected from
   the bed of the main channel. The Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) concentrations
   were measured by gamma spectrometry. Then, a linear mixing model was
   used to establish the contribution of each source type to the bed
   sediments along the main stream.
   First post-fire flush effect was generated by a torrential event with a
   suspended sediment concentration peak of 33,618 mg L-1, although
   transmission losses under a very low runoff coefficient (1\%) promoted
   sediment deposition. Significant differences were observed in fallout
   radionuclide concentrations between burned surface soil and burned
   channel bank samples (p < 0.05), as well as between burned and unburned
   sources in the downstream part of the catchment (p < 0.01). The
   radioactivity concentrations in bed sediment samples were statistically
   similar (p > 0.05). Source ascription in bed sediments upstream shows
   that 67\% was generated from burned hillslopes, reaching 75\% in the
   downstream part, because downstream propagation of the sediment derived
   from the burned area.
   Bed sediments were mostly generated on burned surface soils because of
   the fire's effect on soil and sediment availability, high-intensity
   rainfall, and the limited contribution of channel banks, because these
   are fixed by dry-stone walls. This hydro-sedimentary response indicates
   an association between these factors driving erosion and sediment
   delivery, generating effective slope-to-channel sediment connectivity.
   The integration of the short-term response with the medium- and
   long-term analysis will allow for the analysis of the evolution of
   catchment sediment sources in future studies, determining if fire
   modifies the catchment sensitivity to that specific disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 452 species, comprising 262 lichens, 78 mosses and 112
   liverworts, is recorded from Eucalyptus obliqua L'Her. dominated wet
   forest in southern Tasmania. A classification of the species is
   presented, based on their distribution and ecology. Four groups are
   recognised: (i) mature wet forest species, subdivided further into
   species of old forests, species of old trees, and foliicolous species;
   (ii) species of open eucalypt forests; (iii) widespread and common
   species; and (iv) species of disturbed habitats, subdivided into
   transient colonisers and persistent early colonisers. Together with an
   assessment of conservation status of the species, this classification
   provides a tool whereby simple comparisons of floristic richness or
   species composition can be refined so that the ecological `quality' of a
   site can be evaluated. A case study comparing the flora before and after
   burning demonstrates the usefulness of the approach. It showed that
   although the diversity of cryptogams recovers quite quickly, the species
   composition of the flora alters significantly. The classification
   represents the first of its kind for lichens and bryophytes in

   other forest types and non-forest vegetation. Several lichens, including

Abstract = {{Fires in mountain big sagebrush {[}Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana
   (Rydb.) Beetle] plant communities historically shifted dominance from
   woody to herbaceous vegetation. However, fire return intervals have
   lengthened with European settlement, and sagebrush dominance has
   increased at the expense of herbaceous vegetation in some plant
   communities. Management actions may be needed to decrease sagebrush in
   dense sagebrush stands to increase herbaceous vegetation. Prescribed
   fire is often used to remove sagebrush; however, mechanical treatments,
   such as mowing, are increasingly used because they are more controllable
   and do not pose an inherent risk of escape compared with fire. However,
   information on the effects of burned and mowed treatments on herbaceous
   vegetation and whether fire and mowed applications elicit similar
   vegetation responses are limited. We evaluated the effects of prescribed
   burning and mowing for 3 years after treatment in mountain big sagebrush
   plant communities. The burned and mowed treatments generally increased
   herbaceous cover, density, and production compared with untreated
   controls (P < 0.05). However, neither treatment induced a response in
   native perennial forb cover, density, or biomass (P > 0.05). In
   contrast, annual forb (predominately natives) cover, density, and
   biomass increased with mowing and burning (P < 0.05). Vegetation
   generally responded similarly in burned and mowed treatments; however,
   the burned treatment had less sagebrush, greater herbaceous vegetation
   production, and more bare ground than the mowed treatment (P < 0.05).
   These differences should be considered when selecting treatments to
   decrease sagebrush.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem carbon emissions from 2015 forest fires in interior Alaska}},
Journal = {{CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the summer of 2015, hundreds of wildfires burned across
   the state of Alaska, and consumed more than 1.6 million ha of boreal
   forest and wetlands in the Yukon-Koyukuk region. Mapping of 113 large
   wildfires using Landsat satellite images from before and after 2015
   indicated that nearly 60\% of this area was burned at moderateto-high
   severity levels. Field measurements near the town of Tanana on the Yukon
   River were carried out in July of 2017 in both unburned and 2015 burned
   forested areas (nearly adjacent to one-another) to visually verify
   locations of different Landsat burn severity classes (low, moderate, or
   high; LBS, MBS, HBS).
   Results: Field measurements indicated that the loss of surface organic
   layers in boreal ecosystem fires is a major factor determining post-fire
   soil temperature changes, depth of thawing, and carbon losses from the
   mineral topsoil layer. Measurements in forest sites showed that soil
   temperature profiles to 30 cm depth at burned forest sites were higher
   by an average of 8-10 degrees C compared to unburned forest sites.
   Sampling and laboratory analysis indicated a 65\% reduction in soil
   carbon content and a 58\% reduction in soil nitrogen content in severely
   burned sample sites compared to soil mineral samples from nearby
   unburned spruce forests.
   Conclusions: Combined with nearly unprecedented forest areas severely
   burned in the Interior region of Alaska in 2015, total ecosystem
   fire-related losses of carbon to the atmosphere exceeded most previous
   estimates for the state, owing mainly to inclusion of potential ``mass
   wasting{''} and decomposition in the mineral soil carbon layer in the 2
   years following these forest fires.}},

Abstract = {{The sawgrass Cladium jamaicense forms extensive, quite monospecific
   stands within coastal swamps of the Caribbean region. Fire acts as an
   important ecological factor in the control of vegetation dynamics in

   fires are set as a customary practice nearly each year. The purpose of
   this study was to characterize the ecology of Cladium marshes in
   Guadeloupe and to assess more specifically floristic and structural
   changes that might occur within these marsh communities once the setting
   of fires has been discontinued. Fifty-four 2 X 10 m plots were set up
   along seaward/landward transects including mangrove and swamp forest
   edges. The main characteristics of soil and vegetation in a regularly
   burned marsh were compared to those of two marshes where the setting of
   fires had been discontinued for at least 15 years. Cladium height and
   species richness were negatively correlated to water level, redox
   potential, and salinity, and followed decreasing landward/seaward
   gradients. Discontinuation of fire regime modified the vertical
   structure of the vegetation and the marsh flora by promoting woody
   species vs. herbaceous species. Palcoecological investigations are
   needed for a better understanding of the influence of anthropogenic

Abstract = {{Rove beetles are useful subjects for Nearctic forest biodiversity work
   because they are abundant, diverse, and easily collected, and have
   strong habitat affinities. Excellent identification keys exist for Most
   groups, although there is I dearth of ecological and life-history
   information. There is considerable variation in species composition and
   abundance within the active summer season and in abundance from year to
   year. Community composition varies active larger geographical regions
   and to a lesser extent among forest types in more localized areas.
   Within the Nearctic boreal forest there are significant differences
   between beetle communities from the eastern and western portions. For
   the most part, the same species tend to dominate rove beetle communities
   in the western boreal forest. At the landscape level there are
   differences in rove beetle communities along Successional gradients. In
   the boreal forest the communities of Younger aspen-dominated and older
   conifer-dominated stands are some what distinct, with intermediate
   stands containing a mix of the two communities. At the ecosite and
   microsite level there is significant variation, which remains poorly
   understood. Fire is the dominant mode of disturbance in the Nearctic
   boreal forest. It has a profound effect oil rove beetles by destroying,
   the forest communities and resetting the Successional trajectory to the
   earliest stages. The burn pattern results in a patchwork of different
   communities a various stages in the Successional cycle. In contrast to
   tire, forest harvesting does not directly destroy the rove beetle
   community, but to a large extent it destroys the forest habitat. This
   results in a unique rove beetle community characterized by a mix of
   forest species and open-ground specialists, and overall high diversity
   in this period Of flux. In the years after harvesting, the rove beetle
   community goes through Successional changes and becomes more similar to
   the forest community, but it skips the early postfire stage and proceeds
   along the successional trajectory more rapidly than after fire. In at
   least one forest type in western Canada, the post-fire and post-harvest
   communities, though Similar, have not converged after 29 years. Other
   less direct effects of harvesting oil rove beetles are I decrease in the
   proportion of the land base Suitable for communities associated with
   older successional stages: alteration Of forests by post-harvest site
   preparations and planting of exotic tree species; edge and fragmentation
   effects that are detrimental to the remaining forest Surrounding
   harvested areas: and in influx of exotic arthropod species with
   affinities for disturbed sites. More information is needed oil the
   habitat affinities Of individual species. It is recommended that future
   work explore the effects of post-harvest forestry activities,
   fragmentation, and edges on rove beetles in forested habitats. As well,
   such studies should consider the effects on beetles of riparian zones
   and wetlands.}},

Title = {{Is initial post-disturbance regeneration indicative of longer-term
   trajectories?}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The ability to estimate and model future vegetation dynamics is a
   central focus of contemporary ecology and is essential for understanding
   future ecological trajectories. It is therefore critical to understand
   when the influence of initial post-disturbance regeneration versus
   stochastic processes dominates long-term post-disturbance ecological
   processes. Often, conclusions about post-disturbance dynamics are based
   upon initial regeneration in the years immediately after disturbances.
   However, the degree to which initial post-disturbance regeneration
   indicates longer-term trends is likely to be contingent on the types,
   intensities, and combinations of disturbances, as well as
   pre-disturbance ecosystem structure and composition. Our relatively
   limited understanding of why initial post-disturbance regeneration is
   sometimes a poor predictor of future ecosystem trajectories represents a
   critical gap in post-disturbance ecological forecasting. We studied the
   composition and density of regeneration of tree species following wind
   blowdown in 1997, wildfire in 2002, and compounded disturbances by
   blowdown and wildfire in subalpine forests of Colorado. We examined
   regeneration of Picea engelmannii, Abies lasiocarpa, Pinus contorta, and
   Populus tremuloides in 180 permanent plots across 12 sites (classified
   by pre-disturbance age and composition) in 2003, 2010, and 2015. At
   sites that were blown down but not burned, regeneration was dense and
   dominated by Picea and Abies. At these sites, regeneration observed from
   2003 to 2005 (hereafter initial regeneration) was also highly predictive
   of regeneration 5-10 yr later. In contrast, at sites that were burned
   and sites that were blown down and burned, regeneration was less dense
   and dominated by a mix of species. At these sites, initial regeneration
   was a poor predictor of longer-term trends as species dominance and
   overall density fluctuated over the 13-yr period. These findings call
   into question our ability to confidently predict ecosystem trajectories
   based upon observations made in the years immediately after large,
   severe disturbances such as wildfires and compounded disturbances. As
   compounded disturbances become more common under climatically driven
   changes in disturbance regimes, post-disturbance ecosystem trajectories
   may become increasingly stochastic and unpredictable.}},

Abstract = {{Black spruce is one of the main commercial species in boreal forests of
   North America. It usually forms large and single-species natural stands
   in eastern Canada, yet in recent years, parts of this area have
   undergone forest cover regression and the conversion of closed-crown
   forests to open lichen woodlands, partly due to successive disturbances
   and regeneration accidents. We studied two successive post-fire cohorts
   growing at the same site, for which a clear forest cover regression
   trajectory has already been demonstrated, to assess possible changes in
   the site potential. The Wilcoxon nonparametric test found significant
   differences in mean diameter and height growth between cohorts, compared
   by cambial age, generally with higher mean values for the most recent
   cohort. There were no indications of growth reduction between the
   previous and the current cohorts. This paper sets the ball rolling for a
   discussion on the pertinence of reforestation in this type of recently
   established open formation, where growth potential (as expressed by
   diameter and height) seems, at least, maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Alcoa World Alumina Australia has been rehabilitating bauxite mines in
   the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of Western Australia for more
   than 35 years. Mines rehabilitated in the early 1980s contain some
   eastern Australian eucalypts and have built up substantial fuel loads
   (23-35 t/ha) that may be reduced through prescribed burning. The aim of
   this study was to document vegetation changes in areas rehabilitated in
   the early 1980s for 6 years following prescribed burning and ascertain
   the most appropriate fire regime to apply in these areas to achieve
   identified rehabilitation completion criteria. Following both autumn and
   spring burning, rehabilitated areas rapidly re-accumulated fuel in the
   first year after burning, but fuel loads have remained relatively
   constant since then at a level of 8-9 t/ha. Burning was successful in
   removing dead aerated fuel that dominated the midstorey of the
   vegetation and stimulating plant growth in the understorey, making the
   burnt rehabilitated areas more like the unmined forest. Plant density,
   live plant cover, Acacia density and Acacia cover were generally higher
   following autumn than spring burning, although differences were reduced
   over time. Weed density did not differ significantly between autumn and
   spring burning, peaking 2 years after burning and then declining back to
   pre-burn levels. Similarly, species richness peaked in the first few
   years following burning and then declined, consistent with the
   predictions of the initial floristic composition model of succession.
   Tree growth was lower in burnt than unburnt areas for the first 2 years,
   but 4 and 6 years after burning tree growth was not significantly
   different between autumn, spring and no burn areas. Alcoa is required to
   integrate rehabilitated areas into the fire management regime of the
   surrounding jarrah forest to meet completion criteria. The results
   suggest that this can be achieved by burning rehabilitated areas
   containing non-native eucalypt species in spring under low to moderate
   intensity. This fire regime will lead to reduced fuel accumulation, a
   less prominent midstorey layer resulting from reduced recruitment of
   Acacia spp., lower densities of eastern Australian eucalypt species, and
   greater similarity in the composition and abundance of the understorey
   to the unmined forest. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between native and exotic richness has mostly been

   Re-analysis of early post-fire successional data for a California
   chaparral community shows that, in the same communities and at small
   spatial scales, the native-exotic correlations varied through time. Both
   exotic richness and exotic fraction (i.e., the proportion of exotic
   species in the flora) quickly increased and then gradually declined,

   treatments. A rainfall rate of 67 mm h(-1) was applied for 30 min to
   each runoff plot. Seeding significantly increased plant species richness
   in the treated plots relative to the control plots, although it had no
   effect on diversity or evenness. Rehabilitation treatments did not
   significantly increase soil cover or affect runoff and infiltration.
   Soil losses were low in all cases, varying from 75.6 kg ha(-1) in the
   seeded + mulched plots to 212.1 kg ha(-1) in the untreated plots.
   However, there were no significant differences in sediment yields
   between treatments. The percentage of bare soil appeared to be a
   critical variable in controlling runoff and erosion. Copyright (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Fire is an important factor controlling the composition and thickness of
   the organic layer in the black spruce forest ecosystems of interior
   Alaska. Fire that burns the organic layer can trigger dramatic changes
   in the underlying permafrost, leading to accelerated ground thawing
   within a relatively short time. In this study, we addressed the
   following questions. (1) Which factors determine post-fire ground
   temperature dynamics in lowland and upland black spruce forests? (2)
   What levels of burn severity will cause irreversible permafrost
   degradation in these ecosystems?
   We evaluated these questions in a transient modeling-sensitivity
   analysis framework to assess the sensitivity of permafrost to climate,
   burn severity, soil organic layer thickness, and soil moisture content
   in lowland (with thick organic layers, similar to 80 cm) and upland
   (with thin organic layers, similar to 30 cm) black spruce ecosystems.
   The results indicate that climate warming accompanied by fire
   disturbance could significantly accelerate permafrost degradation. In
   upland black spruce forest, permafrost could completely degrade in an 18
   m soil column within 120 years of a severe fire in an unchanging
   climate. In contrast, in a lowland black spruce forest, permafrost is
   more resilient to disturbance and can persist under a combination of
   moderate burn severity and climate warming.}},

Abstract = {{Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a common structural component of
   terrestrial ecosystems, and provides important habitat for biota. Fires
   modify the distribution of CWD, both spatially and temporally. Changes
   in fire regimes, such as those arising from prescribed burning and
   changing climatic conditions, make it critical to understand the
   response of this resource to fire. We created a conceptual model of the
   effects of fire on logs and dead trees in topographically diverse
   forests in which trees often survive severe fire. We then surveyed
   paired sites, in a damp gully and adjacent drier slope, similar to 3.5
   years after a large wildfire in south-eastern Australia. Sites were
   stratified by fire severity (unburnt, understorey burnt and severely
   burnt), and fire history (burnt <= 3 years or >= 20 years prior to the
   wildfire). Both components of the fire regime influenced CWD
   availability in gullies. Severe wildfire and fire history <= 3 years
   reduced the volume of small logs (10-30 cm diameter) in gullies, while
   severe wildfire increased the number of large dead trees in gullies. CWD
   on slopes was not affected by fire severity or history at similar to 3.5
   years post-fire. Log volumes on slopes may recover more quickly after
   wildfire through rapid collapse of branches and trees. Gullies generally
   supported more logs than slopes, but longer inter-fire intervals in
   gullies may allow fuel loads to accumulate and lead to comparatively
   larger fire impacts. Given that fire severity and fire interval are
   predicted to change in many fire-prone ecosystems in coming decades,
   this study highlights the importance of understanding the interacting
   effects of multiple components of the fire regime with landscape
   structure. In particular, variation in fire interval and fire severity
   in relation to topographic position will influence the pattern of
   accumulation of coarse woody debris across the landscape, and therefore
   the structure and quality of habitats for biota. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Grassy woodlands have been extensively cleared for agricultural land
   uses; land managers need to know whether restoration of biodiversity on
   such sites requires further interventions beyond simply stopping
   agricultural land use. Cumberland Plain Woodland occurs on shale-derived
   soils in western Sydney; former Cumberland Plain Woodland sites can
   range from grasslands cleared for agricultural use to regenerated
   woodlands. An experiment was established in Scheyville National Park to
   determine what effect repeated burning would have in this system. Four
   blocks were established (three in grassy areas, one in woodland) and
   plots in each block were either burnt in 2001 and 2005 or left unburnt.
   Native plant species richness was initially lower in the grassy blocks
   than in the woodland, and this ranking remained on unburnt plots over
   time. The first fire increased species richness of both natives and
   exotics on the grassy blocks, with the largest increases observed for
   native and exotic forbs, and lesser increases for grasses (native only),
   gramminoids and shrubs. Native species richness changed very little with
   burning in the woodland. Fire effects on species richness were still
   apparent 3 years later on the grassy blocks; the difference between the
   grassy blocks and the woodland was not significant on burnt plots at
   this stage. Changes in native species richness were far less after the
   second fire on the grassy blocks, with grasses and gramminoids showing
   increases; native species richness remained higher in the burnt
   treatment. The first fire reduced the initial differences in native
   species richness between the grassy blocks and the woodland, and the
   second fire maintained the benefit through time. Fire also increased
   exotic species richness; the proportion of total species as natives was
   not altered by the two fires. On unburnt grassy plots, native species
   richness and prior cumulative rainfall were positively related; a
   decline in native species richness on unburnt plots corresponded to
   increasingly drier conditions over the study.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread uses of the
   rangelands of Australia. There is limited information on the effects of
   grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of Australia and
   the establishment of a long-term grazing experiment in north-eastern
   Queensland at Wambiana provided an opportunity to attempt an examination
   of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of the manipulation
   of stocking rates. The aim was to identify what the relative effects of
   vegetation type, stocking rate and other landscape-scale environmental
   factors were on the patterns recorded. Sixteen 1-ha sites were
   established within three replicated treatments (moderate, heavy and
   variable stocking rates). The sites were sampled in the wet and dry
   seasons in 1999-2000 (T-0) and again in 2003-04 (T-1). All paddocks of
   the treatments were burnt in 1999. Average annual rainfall declined
   markedly between the two sampling periods, which made interpretation of
   the data difficult. A total of 127 species of vertebrate fauna
   comprising five amphibian, 83 bird, 27 reptile and 12 mammal species
   were recorded. There was strong separation in faunal composition from
   T-0 to T-1 although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between
   the grazing stocking rate treatments were less well defined. There was a
   relative change in abundance of 24 bird, four mammal and five reptile
   species from T-0 to T-1. The generalised linear modelling identified
   that, in the T-1 data, there was significant variation in the abundance
   of 16 species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors. This
   study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did change and that
   these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking
   rates, the vegetation types on the sites surveyed, the burning of the
   experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of
   the two surveys. It is recommended that the experiment is sampled again
   but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa (i.e.
   birds and reptiles) to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling
   and replication of the data. This would help to articulate more clearly
   the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of
   stocking rates compared with wider landscape environmental changes.
   Given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern
   Australia, any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on
   biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should be taken for
   the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species.}},

Title = {{Shorter fallow cycles affect the availability of noncrop plant resources
   in a shifting cultivation system}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Shifting cultivation systems, one of the most widely distributed forms
   of agriculture in the tropics, provide not only crops of cultural
   significance, but also medicinal, edible, ritual, fuel, and forage
   resources, which contribute to the livelihoods, health, and cultural
   identity of local people. In many regions across the globe, shifting
   cultivation systems are undergoing important changes, one of the most
   pervasive being a shortening of the fallow cycle. Although there has
   been much attention drawn to declines in crop yields in conjunction with
   reductions in fallow times, little if any research has focused on the
   dynamics of noncrop plant resources. In this paper, we use a data set of
   26 fields of the same age, i.e., similar to 1.5 yr, but differing in the
   length and frequency of past fallow cycles, to examine the impact of
   shorter fallow periods on the availability of noncrop plant resources.
   The resources examined are collected in shifting cultivation fields by
   the Yucatec Maya in Quintana Roo, Mexico. These included firewood, which
   is cut from remnant trees and stumps spared at the time of felling, and
   17 forage species that form part of the weed vegetation. Firewood showed
   an overall decrease in basal area with shorter fallow cycles, which was
   mostly related to the smaller diameter of the spared stumps and trees in
   short-fallow milpas. In contrast, forage species showed a mixed
   response. Species increasing in abundance in short-fallow milpas tended
   to be short-lived herbs and shrubs often with weedy habits, whereas
   those declining in abundance were predominantly pioneer trees and
   animal-dispersed species. Coppicing tree species showed a neutral
   response to fallow intensity. Within the cultural and ecological context
   of our study area, we expect that declines in firewood availability will
   be most significant for livelihoods because of the high reliance on
   firewood for local fuel needs and the fact that the main alternative
   source of firewood, forest patches, has also declined in short-fallow
   areas. Declines in some forage species can likely be compensated for by
   the use of other species or by adaptive responses such as managing
   declining species in home gardens. However, the loss of pioneer tree
   species in short-fallow milpas suggests that the regenerative capacity
   of the fallows may be reduced with implications for maintaining
   effective fallow cycles in this shifting cultivation system. Our
   findings indicate that the dynamics of noncrop plant resources and their
   implications for local livelihoods require further consideration in the
   debate over improving the productivity of shifting cultivation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Poultry manure (PM) efficacy to improve burnt soil revegetation was
   evaluated to determine the lowest effective and the optimum dose for

   up six treatments: LSI laboratory burnt LS (BLS) and BLS with PM dose
   equivalent to 1 (BLS + PM1), 2 (BLS + PM2), 4 (BLS + PM4) and 8 Mg dry
   PM ha(-1) (BLS + PM8). Ryegrass was sown in all treatments and grown for
   3 months in a greenhouse. At harvesting, in the BLS treatment: (1)
   ryegrass yield was very low and the shoot:root ratio was high: (2)
   ryegrass-N content was closer to that of metabolic tissues or young
   plants than to structural tissues or mature plants; (3) most of the
   available endogenous N still remained in the soil inorganic N pool.
   These results suggested that, although seed germinated normally,
   ryegrass growth was stopped at an early developmental stage, producing
   small and weak plants unable to protect the burnt soil against erosion
   and to exploit the post-fire pulse of available N which, consequently,
   could be lost. The addition of Ph? to BLS increased the ryegrass yield
   from the lowest dose (BLS approximate to LS < BLS + PM1 < BLS + PM2 <
   BLS + PM4 < BLS + PM8; P < 0.05), the increase of the phytomass yield
   per Mg of added Phl: varying as follows: PM8 < PM1 less than or equal to
   PM4 < PM2. The uptake of soil-available N by the ryegrass was greatly
   enhanced in all manured treatments, but the contribution of PM-N to
   plant nutrition was only significant in BLS + PM4 and BLS + PM8
   treatments. The lowest effective PRM dose was PM1 and the optimum
   cost-to-benefit ratio treatments were PM2 and PM4.}},

   controlled by sprouting species that early lose dominance in favour of
   obligate seeders. All dominance-diversity curves, corresponding to
   different stand ages, approach geometric series and agree with the
   niche-preemption model. A certain degree of co-dominance, however, is
   characteristic of the intermediate and pre-competitive stages because of
   the coexistence of several life history types before a few woody species
   become dominant. 115 days after the fire, biomass of woody species
   represented a 34\% of the total aerial biomass, of which 83\% were
   resprouters. Conversely, woody species accounted for 86\% of the
   aboveground biomass in the two year old stand, a 73\% of it being due to
   obligately seedling species. Changes from contagious to random spatial
   patterns of plant distribution were detected as clusters of seedlings
   were being thinned. The three gorse scrubland dominant species (Ulex

   half-shrubs that establish numerous seedlings after the fire but that
   lack the ability to sprout. Besides the significancy of their life

Abstract = {{The Raramuri (Tarahumara) people live in the mountains and canyons of
   the Sierra Madre Occidental of Chihuahua, Mexico. They base their
   subsistence on multiple-use strategies of their natural resources,
   including agriculture, pastoralism, and harvesting of native plants and
   wildlife. Pino Gordo is a Raramuri settlement in a remote location where
   the forest has not been commercially logged. We reconstructed the forest
   fire regime from fire-scarred trees, measured the structure of the
   never-logged forest, and interviewed community members about fire use.
   Fire occurrence was consistent throughout the 19th and 20th centuries up
   to our fire scar collection in 2004. This is the least interrupted
   surface-fire regime reported to date in North America. Studies from
   other relict sites such as nature reserves in Mexico or the USA have all
   shown some recent alterations associated with industrialized society. At
   Pino Gordo, fires recurred frequently at the three study sites, with a
   composite mean fire interval of 1.9 years (all fires) to 7.6 years
   (fires scarring 25\% or more of samples). Per-sample fire intervals
   averaged 10-14 years at the three sites. Approximately two-thirds of
   fires burned in the season of cambial dormancy, probably during the
   pre-monsoonal drought. Forests were dominated by pines and contained
   many large living trees and snags, in contrast to two nearby similar
   forests that have been logged. Community residents reported using fire
   for many purposes, consistent with previous literature on fire use by
   indigenous people. Pino Gordo is a valuable example of a continuing
   frequent-fire regime in a never-harvested forest. The Raramuri people
   have actively conserved this forest through their traditional livelihood
   and management techniques, as opposed to logging the forest, and have
   also facilitated the fire regime by burning. The data contribute to a
   better understanding of the interactions of humans who live in pine
   forests and the fire regimes of these ecosystems, a topic that has been
   controversial and difficult to assess from historical or paleoecological

   were not burnt, surface burnt and characterized by complete burnout of
   the organic horizon of the soil. Than we measured the thickness of this
   horizon. Additionally the volume of organic matter burnt within each
   plot was calculated. Vegetation was sampled using Londo scale in the
   year of fire (2015) and the year after (2016). We used DCA ordination
   and UPGMA classification methods. Recorded species were divided into
   forest and non-forest groups and additionally for trees and shrubs, and
   the others, containing dwarf shrub, herb, bryophyte and lichen species.
   The linear regression method was used to estimate the relationship
   between measured parameters, vegetation change and changes in the
   species richness of distinguished groups. Two processes of vegetation
   reaction were observed. The first was classified as regeneration and
   occurred within surface burnt plots. Its characteristic feature included
   the higher increase in forest species richness than in case of
   non-forest species. The other process was defined as secondary
   succession alike. It occurred on plots with highest burnout of soil
   organic matter horizon. The increase of richness of non-forest species
   predominated within it. The change between two processes is smooth and
   depends on the participation of area with complete burnout of soil
   organic horizon within plot. The results show, that more than one
   process of recovery of community can occur in the same site and it
   depends especially on the proportion of soil organic horizon area
   burnout.}},

Abstract = {{People have significantly influenced on Orenburg region steppes by
   ploughing large parts of it, or by utilising other parts as mowed
   grasslands, pastures or abandoning crop production on the old abandoned
   fields. Frequent fires are another serious threat to the biodiversity of
   the steppes in the region. The main cause of fires is the anthropogenic
   factor. This problem is relevant not only for managed areas, but also
   for Protected Areas. The need to study the fire effects on ecosystems in
   the Orenburg State Nature Reserve (Russia) has appeared for a long time,
   once it cleared that a special regime of Protected Areas could not
   always preserve steppes of fire influence due to the steppe's specifics
   (i.e., significant length of the fire front and a burnt area, high speed
   of a fire spread under strong wind). At the same time, it is most
   relevant to conduct environmental studies in the Protected Areas as
   ecosystems, least managed and disturbed by humans. It is supplemented by
   excluding of any impacts within these areas and using data of long-term
   research accumulated over previous years. In 2015-2016, we carried out
   the post-fire dynamics of the stock of the above-ground phytomass in the
   site ``Burtinskaya Steppe{''} in the Orenburg State Natural Reserve. The
   study area is located in the steppe zone of the Pre-Ural region. In
   August 2014, more than 20 km(2) of the steppe area was on fire. We
   established six study sites in this area. Each of them included a
   control (unburnt) and a burnt plots. In each plant community, we
   conducted the geobotanical surveys and mowing of the above-ground
   phytomass in spring (May), summer (June), late summer (August), autumn
   (September). The obtained samples were dried, divided into groups
   (grasses, forbs, dwarf semi-shrubs) and then weighted. We compared both
   unburnt and burnt study plots, and found statistically significant
   differences between them using the Mann-Whitney U-test (alpha < 0.05) in
   the total stock of the above-ground phytomass, stock of the dead
   phytomass, the standing dead phytomass, and litter. In the burnt plant
   communities, the accumulation peaks of the living grass and forbs
   phytomass shifted compared to the unburnt plots. During the first two
   post-fire years, only stock of the living phytomass and its components
   (grasses, forbs, dwarf semi-shrubs) were restoring. Other components of
   the above-ground phytomass did not reach the control values. Our data
   were part of a project for creation a framework to monitor ecosystems in
   the preserved area after the 2014 fire impact.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is an important management tool in many parts of the
   world. While natural fires generally occur during the driest and warmest
   period of the year, prescribed burning is often timed out-of-season,
   when there is higher soil moisture and lower biomass combustibility.
   However, fire season may influence seedling recruitment after fire, e.g.
   through the effect of seed hydration status on fire tolerance. In
   non-fire-prone temperate regions, anthropogenic fire may occur
   exclusively in periods outside the growing season with higher soil
   moisture, which may have negative consequences on seedling recruitment.
   Fire tolerance of moist and dry seeds of 16 temperate European
   herbaceous species belonging to four families was assessed using heat
   treatment of 100 degrees C for 5 min and subsequent germination trials.
   Moist seeds of Asteraceae, Poaceae and Brassicaceae had a predominantly
   negative reaction to the heat treatment, while those of Fabaceae
   tolerated it or germination was even enhanced. The reaction of dry seeds
   was completely different, with positive responses in three species of
   the Fabaceae and fire tolerance in species of other families. Our
   results point out that hydration status may significantly influence the
   post-fire germination of seeds. Dry seeds were found to tolerate high
   heat, while moist seeds were harmed in more than half of the species.
   This implies that if prescribed burning is applied in temperate
   grasslands of Europe, it should be timed to dry periods of the dormant
   season in order to protect seeds from negative effects of fire.}},

   Consequently, we examined the response of vegetation and white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus canninis) to wildfire for 2 years in the
   Chisos Mountains, Big Bend National Park (BBNP), Texas. Permanently
   established, random plots (1 m(2)) were established shortly after the

   monitored twice/month. Forbs responded immediately (within 2 weeks
   post-bum) following a spring drought. Mexican pinyon pine (Pinus
   embroides) and alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana) began crown
   regrowth 2 months after the fire. Grasses responded rapidly in open,
   meadow areas. Deer use of the burned area increased following the fire,
   but later decreased to pre-fire rates. When fire is properly managed,
   habitat quality for deer and other herbivores may be increased, and
   critically important meadow areas can be protected from pinyon-juniper

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{345}},

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean ecosystems, post-fire forestry management practices are
   often used to improve forest structure and to reduce the risk of fire in
   coppices of resprouting species. Such practices enhance tree growth
   (i.e., height), probably because they release resources. On the one
   hand, resource release may stimulate reproduction. On the other hand,
   tree species that are regenerating after a fire may already face a delay
   in reproduction, and this delay may be lengthened if species mainly
   invest these additional resources in growth. Within this theoretical
   framework, it is poorly understood how different forest management
   practices affect the reproductive abilities of forest species. In this
   study, we analyzed the effect of two post-fire forestry treatments
   (selective thinning of resprouts and selective thinning of resprouts
   plus understory clearing) on a Mediterranean coppice dominated by the
   resprouter species Arbutus unedo L.; in particular, we examined how the
   treatments affected this species' reproductive ability (flower and fruit
   production at the tree and stand level, as well as fruit
   characteristics). Our results show that the treatments had no effects on
   the number of flowers and mature fruits per individual. Meanwhile,
   mature fruit dry mass and seed set were greater in plots that had been
   both thinned and cleared than in control plots and plots that had only
   been thinned. This pattern was reversed for seed abortion rate: it was
   lower in plots that had been thinned and cleared. The dry mass of
   developed seeds did not differ among treatments. At the stand level, the
   percentage of strawberry trees that flowered, the percentage of
   strawberry trees that bore fruit, the dry biomass of mature fruits per
   hectare, and the number of developed seeds per hectare were not affected
   by these treatments. Other studies have shown that these two forest
   management practices can improve the vertical and horizontal structure
   of A. unedo coppices that are regenerating post fire; this study
   demonstrates that selective thinning does not modify the species'
   reproductive success and, such practice when combined with understory
   clearing might enhance it. Consequently, these forestry practices might
   ensure the natural regeneration of populations of this species, as well
   as the availability of food for local fauna. It is thus highly
   recommended that such practices be used to manage coppices dominated by
   resprouter species following fire, especially in situations where the
   growth of the forest canopy has stagnated and/or reproduction of forest
   species has been delayed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of fire exclusion in the Southern Appalachian Mountains led to
   fuel accumulation and conversion from open oak-pine woodlands to
   closed-canopy mesic forests dominated by shade-tolerant hardwoods and
   shrubs that often do not support a diverse understory. Southern
   Appalachian forest managers and scientists recognize this and are
   implementing silvicultural treatments such as prescribed burning,
   mechanical treatments or a combination of these to restore forest
   structure. In this study, conducted at the Southern Appalachian Fire and
   Fire Surrogate Study site in Green River Game Land, North Carolina, we
   assessed the effects of four fuel reduction methods: burned 4x (B),
   mechanical treatment 2x (M), mechanical treatment 2x + burned 4x (MB),
   and control (C) on the changes in understory vegetation guilds from
   pretreatment to post-treatment years (2001-2016). The MB treatment was
   most effective at meeting the restoration objectives, as it resulted in
   increases in oak ((MB) = 23,400 stems/ha) and pine ((MB) = 900 stems/ha)
   stem density, importance valuecalculated as the sum of relative cover
   and frequencyfor graminoids ((MB) = 26.0), and density of oak stems >50

   generally less effective, but nonetheless met a subset of the
   restoration objectives. The B treatment reduced ericaceous shrub cover
   ((B) = -1.2\%) and increased oak stems 10-50 cm in height ((B) = 10,017

   mesic hardwoods, specifically for yellow-poplar ((M) = 200 stems/ha) and
   blackgum ((M) = 200 stems/ha) as compared with other treatments, but
   significantly increased mountain laurel and rhododendron cover ((M) =

Volume = {{401}},
Pages = {{134-143}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Although the famous competition exclusion principle was thoroughly
   elaborated in the framework of multispecies population models, its
   illustrations with field data were facing certain obstacles. The data we
   deal with were collected by 6 consecutive examinations of bilberry
   (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (V. vitis-idaea) presence/absence in
   20 x 20 cm quadrats located along permanent transects in a Scots pine
   boreal forest. These data feature a great sample size (2000 quadrats x 6
   examinations) and a 5-year interval for each pair of
   examination/re-examination, and the data have enabled us to construct a
   Markov chain model for the fine-scale dynamics of these dominant species
   at the later stages of post-fire succession. The discrete-time
   nonautonomous model consists of the five time-dependent, one-step
   transition matrices that describe changes occurring in the quadrat
   status for the 5 years in the following 4 terms: species-free quadrat;
   bilberry alone, cowberry alone, both species. Calibrated on the data,
   each one-step transition matrix transforms the current distribution of
   quadrats among their statuses exactly to the next one observed and
   yields a steady-state distribution as its (time-specific) positive
   eigenvector. Step-by-step variations in the elements of transition
   matrices do affect the components of the corresponding eigenvectors, but
   do not change the dominance relationships among them.
   Calculated as the 5-th power matrix root from the product of those five
   transition matrices (in the chronological order within their product),
   the geometric average, treated again as a transition matrix, provides
   for the spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed dynamics
   summarizing the whole observation period. We reveal the expected
   terminal stable outcome of species dynamics to be a distribution where
   37\% of quadrats are occupied by the bilberry alone, 11\% by cowberry
   alone, 38\% by the both species, and 14\% be species-free. It is shown
   for the first time that the share of cowberry-alone quadrats decreases
   notably in the course of succession, whereas the share of species
   coexistence quadrats increase.
   The averaged characteristics of cyclicity and status duration in the
   fine-scale dynamics enable us to estimate the total time of the
   secondary post-fire succession as 46-50 years (till reaching a
   distribution close to the terminal one). Of the four statuses
   considered, the cowberry-alone quadrats have the least mean duration
   time (9 years), while the bilberry-and-cowberry quadrats have the
   longest time (18 years), which are explainable by different life spans
   of the shoots in proper species.}},

Abstract = {{The wildland-urban interface (WUI)-the area where wildland vegetation
   and urban buildings intermix-is at a greater risk of fire occurrence
   because of extensive human activity in that area. Although satellite
   remote sensing has become a major tool for assessing fire damage in
   wildlands, it is unsuitable for WUI fire monitoring due to the low
   spatial resolution of the images from satellites that provide frequent
   information which is relevant for timely fire monitoring in WUI. Here,
   we take advantage of frequent (i.e., ca. daily), high-spatial-resolution
   (3 m) imagery acquired from a constellation of nano-satellites operated
   by Planet Labs ({''}Planet{''}) to assess fire damage to urban trees in
   the WUI of a Mediterranean city in Israel (Haifa). The fire occurred at
   the end of 2016, consuming ca. 17,000 of the trees (152 trees ha(-1) )
   within the near-by wildland and urban parts of the city. Three
   vegetation indices (GNDVI, NDVI and GCC) from Planet satellite images
   were used to derive a burn severity map for the WUI area after applying
   a subpixel discrimination method to distinguish between woody and
   herbaceous vegetation. The produced burn severity map was successfully
   validated with information acquired from an extensive field survey in
   the WUI burnt area (overall accuracy and kappa: 87\% and 0.75,
   respectively). Planet's vegetation indices were calibrated using
   in-field tree measurements to obtain high spatial resolution maps of
   burned trees and consumed woody biomass in the WUI. These were used in
   conjunction with an ecosystem services valuation model (i-Tree) to
   estimate spatially-distributed and total economic loss due to damage to
   urban trees caused by the fire. Results show that nearly half of the
   urban trees were moderately and severely burned (26\% and 22\%,
   respectively). The total damage to the urban forest was estimated at ca.
   41 +/- 10 M USD. We conclude that using the method developed in this
   study with high-spatial-resolution Planet images has a great potential
   for WUI fire economic assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Historical agriculture and contemporary disturbances such as fire can
   each affect soil properties, but the relative impact of their separate
   and combined effects is poorly understood. We investigated the effects
   of historical agriculture and contemporary fire frequency on soil
   properties of longleaf pine woodlands in the Southeastern United States.
   We sampled 24 pairs of sites from adjacent former agricultural and
   remnant longleaf pine woodlands based on high (>= four since 1971) and
   low (< four since 1971) fire frequency. We found no evidence for
   interactive effects between agricultural history and fire frequency on
   measured mineral soil properties, yet each disturbance independently
   affected different aspects of the soil. Effects of past agricultural use
   were most apparent in the top 15 cm of the mineral soil, with
   post-agricultural woodlands characterized by increased phosphorus and
   bulk density, as well as decreased organic matter and soil water holding
   capacity, compared to remnant woodlands. Some effects of past
   agricultural use, such as increased phosphorus, were also apparent as
   deep as 30 cm into the soil profile. However, when expressed as stocks
   (to account for differences in bulk density) we found that organic
   matter content was similar among post-agricultural and remnant
   woodlands. With respect to contemporary fire frequency, less frequently
   burned sites had thicker O-horizons (litter and duff layers) and showed
   a trend of greater inorganic nitrogen in mineral soil, relative to
   frequently burned sites. Overall, our results indicate that agricultural
   legacies in soils persist 60 years after agricultural abandonment and
   have impacts that may extend deep into the soil profile. Fire
   suppression additionally affects soils, resulting in additive effects of
   historical and contemporary disturbances. Additional research is needed
   to better determine if and how the combined effects of past and present
   disturbances will affect ecological systems. These combined and
   long-lasting impacts of historical and contemporary disturbances may
   help explain why restoration of native understory vegetation remains
   challenging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We measured vegetation cover and bird abundances on 25 native and 25

   post-fire years in both grassland types. Numbers of fall birds increased
   dramatically on burned plots in both habitats for 2 years, probably in
   response to increased seed production and availability. Dominant species
   attracted to the burn were mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), horned lark
   (Eremophila alpestris), vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus), and
   savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). Summer bird species
   responded to the fire in ways consistent with their general habitat
   associations. Species attracted to the burned sites for 2 or 3 years

Abstract = {{Characterization of scale dependence of fire intervals could inform
   interpretations of fire history and improve fire prescriptions that aim
   to mimic historical fire regime conditions. We quantified the temporal
   variability in fire regimes and described the spatial dependence of fire
   intervals through the analysis of multi-century fire scar records (8
   study sites, 332 trees, 843 fire scars) derived from two historically
   post oak (Quercus stellata Wangenh.) woodland landscapes. Despite large
   differences in fire environment conditions, study sites (similar to 1
   km(2)) burned frequently (mean fire interval {[}MFI] <= 10 yr) before
   Euro-American settlement (pre-EAS), with sites in Tennessee showing
   higher overall fire frequency than sites in Oklahoma, USA. PreEAS MFIs
   decreased exponentially with increasing spatial extent from individual
   trees (similar to 1 m(2)) to landscapes (similar to 100 km(2)). The
   relationship between MFI and spatial extent may help to explain how
   historical observations of annual burning could be recorded in
   woodlands, when experimental studies suggest that this is too frequent
   for tree recruitment. Further investigations of spatial dependence of
   fire intervals would improve our ability to relate historical and
   experimental fire data to present day fire prescriptions, and vice
   versa.}},

   changes and disturbance patterns over 9500 yr. Six major sequences of
   local vegetation development are identified: (A) Pinus period, ca. 9500
   - 7000 cal. BP; (B) Open mire period (ca. 7000 - 4500 cal. BP; (C)
   Betula period, ca. 4500 - 2300 cal. BP; (D) Picea period (ca. 2300 -
   1000 cal. BP; (E) Human impact period (ca. 1000 - 100 cal. BP); and (F)
   Period of human abandonment during the last ca. 100 yr.
   The swamp forest has been highly dynamic in response to various natural
   and anthropogenic disturbance agencies. Several fires have heavily
   influenced the vegetation development. During the last ca. 900 yr human
   influence has been important, initially from grazing and trampling by
   domesticated animals (ca. 1000 - 500 cal. BP), and subsequently
   small-scale cereal growing (ca. 400 - 100 BP). Cutting, burning and
   animal browsing influenced the structure and dynamics of the swamp
   forest by creating a more open stand and suppressing tree regeneration.
   Recent cessation of human impact has led to increased tree regeneration
   and a denser swamp forest stand.
   The present high biodiversity, and subsequent conservation interest does
   not result from long-term stability or absence of fire and human impact.
   However, in spite of repeated disturbances, a continuity of old and
   senescent trees produced a forest type with abundant dead wood. With the
   relatively minor importance of fire over long periods of time, the swamp
   forest developed a structure maintaining a high biological diversity.
   An important issue for maintaining long-term biodiversity in the boreal
   landscape must be to create a mosaic where different forest types are
   present, with a variety of structures, substrates and processes, to
   provide a certain degree of freedom for species to move around in the
   landscape.}},

   among patch types for each of four fires. Generally, oak scrub and

   forests in the Interior of British Columbia, Canada, are adjacent to
   grasslands. Forest ingrowth and tree encroachment, mainly due to fire
   suppression, represent threats to both forest and ranching industries in
   the region. The use of prescribed burning for ecological restoration is
   being practiced, hot the associated ecosystem effects of restoration
   treatments have been little studied in the region. We used a randomized
   complete block design in a prescribed bin-ning experiment. Tree survival
   and the responses of understory vegetation to burning were monitored for
   3 years. The transect method along with crown projection areas (onto the
   ground) were used in comparisons between areas inside and outside of the
   burned area. Fire was effective in eliminating small ponderosa pine (dbh
   < 10 cm) and Douglas-fir (dbh < 20 cm) trees. Therefore, the objective
   of controlling the encroachment of trees wits met by the prescribed
   burn. Species composition at both sites was modified by prescribed
   burning, but spatial variability was overridden by treatment and
   temporal effects. Immediate, short-term reduction of big sagebrush
   Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis was observed in grassland sites,
   while reduction in rabbitbrush Chrysothamnus nauseosus in the forest was
   observed. Data trends indicate that 3 years after burning, total biomass
   and forb biomass increased in grasslands, but graminoid biomass in
   forests was reduced and total understory biomass was not affected by
   burning. Burning also reduced the shrub component in these ecosystems.
   While aboveground biomass production may be enhanced by burning in
   grasslands, the impact of burning on forest understory was minimal and
   burning may result in reduction of graminoids. Therefore, burning call
   be used to control tree encroachment and forest ingrowth in this region.
   Management plans must incorporate topography, species diversity, and
   tree survival to target areas that are most susceptible to tree
   encroachment and to achieve desired results. Extended monitoring is
   necessary to determine the long-term effects of burning on species
   diversity in and productivity of these ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Fire intensity measures the heat output of a fire, and variation in fire
   intensity has been shown to have many effects on the demography of plant
   species, although the consequent effects on the floristic composition of
   communities have rarely been quantified. The effects of variation in
   fire intensity on the floristic composition of dry sclerophyll
   vegetation with different fire histories near Sydney was estimated. In
   particular, differences in species abundance of woodland and shrubland
   communities subjected to four fire-intensity classes: unburnt, low
   intensity (<500 kW m(-1) ), medium intensity (500-2500 kW m(-1) ) and
   high intensity (>2500 kW m(-1) ) were examined. The samples had a
   standardized previous fire frequency and season, thus minimizing the
   effects of other aspects of the fire regime. There was a clear effect of
   fire intensity on the relative abundances of the vascular plant species,
   with increasing intensity of the fire producing vegetation that was
   increasingly different from the unburnt vegetation. This pattern was
   repeated in both the woodland and shrubland vegetation types, suggesting
   that it was not an artefact of the experimental conditions. However, the
   effects of fire intensity on floristic composition were no greater than
   were the differences between these two similar vegetation types, with
   variation in fire intensity accounting for only approximately 10\% of
   the floristic variation. Nevertheless, the effects of fire intensity on
   the abundance of individual species were consistent across taxonomic
   groups, with the monocotyledon and Fabaceae species being more abundant
   at higher than lower intensities, the Proteaceae and Rutaceae more
   abundant at intermediate intensities, and the Epacridaceae more abundant
   at lower rather than higher intensities. The number of fire-tolerant
   species increased with increasing fire intensity, and those
   fire-tolerant species present were most abundant in the areas burnt with
   medium intensity. The number of fire-sensitive species did not respond
   to fire intensity, and those species present were most abundant in the
   areas burnt with low intensity. This suggests that either fire-sensitive
   species respond poorly to higher fire intensities or fire-tolerant
   species respond poorly to lower fire intensities, perhaps because of
   differences in seed germination, seedling survival or competition among
   adults.}},

Abstract = {{Despite substantial investment in prescribed burning for biodiversity
   conservation there has been surprisingly little demonstration of its
   efficacy in achieving intended conservation aims for fauna. In the case
   of northern Australia's threatened mammal fauna, most studies have
   reported negative responses to fire. We used satellite-derived fire scar
   imagery and small mammal survey data to compare fire regimes and
   threatened mammal abundance before and after implementation of
   broad-scale prescribed burning in north-western Australia. Specifically,
   we tested: (1) whether prescribed burning was effective in changing fire
   regimes; (2) whether all mammal species and functional groups responded
   to prescribed burning; and (3) what regional fire and environmental
   variables explained changes in mammal status. Low-intensity, patchy
   prescribed burning in the early dry season reduced the extent of high
   intensity late dry season wildfires. In sandstone habitats the abundance
   of all mammals, and the large marsupials and specialist rodent
   functional groups, increased concurrently with early dry season
   prescribed burning. All mammals and the small dasyurid functional group
   in woodland habitats also increased during this period. Early dry season
   prescribed burning extent was the strongest explanatory variable for
   mammal increases. Early dry season burning was also the strongest
   explanatory variable for woodland mammal abundance, but these mammals
   also had a positive association with extent of large patches of old
   growth vegetation (> 4 years since fire). Generalist rodents did not
   respond to prescribed burning and two other species declined following
   prescribed burning in one habitat. Generalist rodents and the two
   declining species had a negative association with extent of late dry
   season fire and a positive association with old growth vegetation
   (interacting with patch size). These results suggest an increased
   application of patchy early dry season prescribed burning of up to ca.
   30\% of the area will benefit positive fire responder species of
   threatened mammals including large specialist rock/arboreal rodents and
   most marsupial species. For mammals such as generalist terrestrial
   rodents with predominantly negative associations with fire, managers
   should seek to increase the size and extent of old growth vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of large ungulate herbivory on plant community structure and

   wildfires. The Cerro Grande Fire (CGF) of May 2000 burned 17,400 ha of
   elk transitory-use range in the Jemez Mountains, north-central New
   Mexico. Our objective was to determine if habitat use changed temporally
   following the fire and if graminoid cover offset use of regenerating
   woody species. We assessed female elk habitat use at the landscape, home
   range, and burned area scales using distance analyses techniques, diet
   analyses, and browsing data. Across the landscape, elk selected home
   ranges with a grassland component. Selection of home ranges across the
   landscape was not influenced by the burned area within 4 years
   post-fire. Within home ranges, preference for burned area was similar to
   other habitats suggesting the burned area played a more important role
   at the home range scale compared to the landscape scale, particularly
   during drought. The presence of graminoids in elk pellets collected from
   the burned area increased while shrubs decreased over time. The decrease
   in shrubs may have been due to an increase in graminoid production after
   the fire. Applying burn treatments to transitory ranges in the Jemez
   Mountains at a rate that will maintain growth of early to mid-seral
   stage vegetation may help off-set use of sensitive woody plant
   communities via the production of graminoids. Re-seeding grasses
   immediately following fire may help to reduce herbivore use of woody
   plants such as aspen during the earlier stages of re-growth.}},

Abstract = {{The indiscriminate burning of vegetation is a common practice in the

   effects of time of burning on tree diversity and density in the Mole
   National Park, Ghana. A total of 36 (10 m x 10 m) quadrats were randomly
   demarcated in three treatments of early and late dry season burning and
   non-burning study plots. Samples were taken in March, a few weeks after
   the late burning period. Twenty seven different species belonging to
   fourteen families were recorded in all the treatments. Most of the
   species identified belonged to the families Combretaceae, Fabaceae and
   Leguminoceae. Vitellaria paradoxa, Terminalia avicennioides, Combretum
   adenogonium and Combretum molle were the most common and abundant in all
   treatments. Late burning plots recorded the lowest diversity amongst the
   three treatments. Non-burning plots had higher tree density than burnt
   plots. Early burning treatment recorded more diverse individual species
   but had the lowest density. Higher tree densities would enhance carbon
   sequestration. However, ecosystem resilience is also dependent on the
   diversity of biotic communities among other factors. Sustainable land
   use practices including protections of trees on farms and prescribed
   early dry season burns could be an option to contribute to the
   mitigation of climate change in the region. Late dry season fires are a
   threat to tree species populations and should be discouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to detect environmental and disturbance factors that
   determine plant species composition in a downstream riverside floodplain
   of the Shinano River, where both natural flooding and artificial fire
   disturbances predominate. We classified the natural vegetation into five
   types by physiognomy, i.e., burnt field, intact (unburnt) field,
   early-successional forest, later-successional forest, and margin of
   channel. We deployed 14 transect belts containing 713 plots of 1 m x 1 m
   at these sites. In the plots, we determined plant occurrences and values
   of five environmental (soil moisture, soil texture, relative elevation
   above the river, horizontal distance from the river, and light
   conditions) and two disturbance factors (scouring of plants by flooding
   and fire). Plant species compositions and environmental and disturbance
   factors were different among the sites. Logistic regression analysis
   showed that burning stimulated the occurrences of herbaceous annuals and
   conversely constrained those of woody and fern species, suggesting that
   fire disturbance resets the succession. Scouring of plants by flooding
   also affected the occurrences of many species, and had a positive
   influence on that of herbaceous winter annuals in particular. Canonical
   correspondence analysis indicated that the distributional
   characteristics of the plant species in the riverside floodplain were
   influenced primarily by distance from the river, reflecting the
   magnitude of flood disturbance. We conclude that (1) magnitude of flood
   disturbance is the primary factor determining plant species composition,

   simultaneously creates a unique plant species composition by stimulating
   the germination of buried viable seeds transported by flood.}},

Abstract = {{P> The study focuses on species-rich, upland, heathy vegetation with
   arctic-alpine floristic affinities and Sesleria grasslands in the
   karstic Burren region, western Ireland. The investigations aimed at
   reconstructing the long-term development of these high
   conservation-value communities and the role of farming in their
   formation and long-term survival.
   The methods used included pollen analysis and (14)C-dating of short
   monoliths and investigation of grykes (fissures in karstic limestone)
   for evidence of soil erosion. Special attention was paid to fossil,
   coprophilous fungal spores as indicators of local grazing. The strong
   local character of the pollen records facilitated identification of
   inter-site differences as well as regional patterns. It is shown that
   open pine woodland characterized the Cappanawalla uplands between c.
   1500 BC and 500 BC. It is proposed that such woodlands, with floristic
   affinities to Scandinavian open pine woodlands on calcareous soils,
   provided a suitable environment for the present-day, open heath
   vegetation with species such as Dryas octopetala, Arctostaphylos
   uva-ursi, Geranium sanguineum and Empetrum nigrum.
   Burning of vegetation as a management tool was important in the uplands
   over most of the last two millennia. Firing seems to have ceased with
   the onset of more intensive grazing regimes in the 18th century.
   Synthesis. Upland palaeoarchives, derived from shallow peaty deposits,
   show that the upland Burren supported mainly plagioclimax
   Corylus-dominated woody vegetation and grasslands from c. 1500 BC
   (beginning of present record), until possibly as late as the 17th
   century AD. In the uplands of the north-western Burren, open,
   species-rich pinewoods with hazel dominated. The northern-arctic
   elements in the present-day upland flora survived clearances, involving
   initially Pinus sylvestris (c. 500 BC) and subsequently Corylus avellana
   (c. AD 1600). Colluvial material retrieved from grykes supports the idea
   of considerable soil loss occurring as late as the first and early 2nd
   millennium AD. The investigations highlight the potential of upland
   palaeoarchives, consisting of short sequences, for elucidating
   vegetation and land-use dynamics in karstic environments such as the
   Burren.}},

Title = {{Fuel dynamics after reintroduced fire in an old-growth Sierra Nevada
   mixed- conifer forest}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Surface fuel loadings are some of the most important factors
   contributing to fire intensity and fire spread. In old-growth forests
   where fire has been long excluded, surface fuel loadings can be high and
   can include woody debris >= 100 cm in diameter. We assessed surface fuel
   loadings in a long-unburned old-growth mixed-conifer forest in Yosemite
   National Park, California, USA, and assessed fuel consumption from a
   management-ignited fire set to control the progression of the 2013 Rim
   Fire. Specifically, we characterized the distribution and heterogeneity
   of pre-fire fuel loadings, both along transects and contained in duff
   mounds around large trees. We compared surface fuel consumption to that
   predicted by the standard First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) based
   on pre-fire fuel loadings and fuel moistures. We also assessed the
   relationship between tree basal area-calculated for two different
   spatial neighborhood scales-and pre-fire fuel loadings.
   Results: Pre-fire total surface fuel loading averaged 192 Mg ha(-1) and
   was reduced by 79\% by the fire to 41 Mg ha(-1) immediately after fire.
   Most fuel components were reduced by 87\% to 90\% by the fire, with the
   exception of coarse woody debris (CWD), which was reduced by 60\%.
   Litter depth in duff mounds were within 1 SD of plot means, but duff
   biomass for the largest trees (>150 cm diameter at breast height
   {[}DBH]) exceeded plot background levels. Overstory basal area generally
   had significant positive relationships with pre-fire fuel loadings of
   litter, duff, 1-hour, and 10 hour fuels, but the strength of the
   relationships differed between overstory components (live, dead, all
   {[}live and dead], species), and negative relationships were observed
   between live Pinus lambertiana Douglas basal area and CWD. FOFEM
   over-predicted rotten CWD consumption and under-predicted duff
   consumption.
   Conclusions: Surface fuel loadings were characterized by heterogeneity
   and the presence of large pieces. This heterogeneity likely contributed
   to differential fire behavior at small scales and heterogeneity in the
   post-fire environment. The reductions in fuel loadings at our research
   site were in line with ecological restoration objectives; thus,
   ecologically restorative burning during fire suppression is possible.}},

Volume = {{303}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Sequestration of carbon (C) in forests has the potential to mitigate the
   effects of climate change by offsetting future emissions of greenhouse
   gases. However, in dry temperate forests, wildfire is a natural
   disturbance agent with the potential to release large fluxes of C into
   the atmosphere. Climate-driven increases in wildfire extent and severity
   are expected to increase the risks of reversal to C stores and affect
   the potential of dry forests to sequester C. In the western United
   States, fuel treatments that successfully reduce surface fuels in dry
   forests can mitigate the spread and severity of wildfire, while reducing
   both tree mortality and emissions from wildfire. However, heterogeneous
   burn environments, site-specific variability in post-fire ecosystem
   response, and uncertainty in future fire frequency and extent complicate
   assessments of long-term (decades to centuries) C dynamics across large
   landscapes. Results of studies on the effects of fuel treatments and
   wildfires on long-term C retention across large landscapes are limited
   and equivocal. Stand-scale studies, empirical and modeled, describe a
   wide range of total treatment costs (12-116 Mg C ha(-1)) and reductions
   in wildfire emissions between treated and untreated stands (1-40 Mg C
   ha(-1)). Conclusions suggest the direction (source, sink) and magnitude
   of net C effects from fuel treatments are similarly variable (-33 Mg C
   ha(-1) to +3 Mg C ha(-1)). Studies at large spatial and temporal scales
   suggest that there is a low likelihood of high-severity wildfire events
   interacting with treated forests, negating any expected C benefit from
   fuels reduction. The frequency, extent, and severity of wildfire are
   expected to increase as a result of changing climate, and additional
   information on C response to management and disturbance scenarios is
   needed improve the accuracy and usefulness of assessments of fuel
   treatment and wildfire effects on C dynamics. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{BackgroundPrescribed burning is a common practice of site preparation
   before afforestation in subtropical forests. However, the effects of
   prescribed burning on carbon (C) dynamics of an ecosystem are poorly
   understood. Therefore, a Eucalyptus urophylla plantation (EU) and a
   naturally recovered shrubland (NS), each treated with prescribed burning
   and no burning were examined in subtropical China.MethodsBiomass of
   trees and shrubs in the 1st, 3nd, 4th, and 6th year after treatments
   were estimated by quadrat survey and allometric equations. Biomass of
   herbs and forest floors were estimated by harvest method. Plant biomass
   C storage was calculated by plant biomass multiplying by its C
   concentration. Soil organic C (SOC) storage in the 6th year after
   treatments was estimated by SOC concentration multiplying by soil bulk
   density and soil volumes.ResultsTree biomass C storage was significantly
   higher in the burned EU (BEU) than in the unburned EU (UEU) in the 1st
   year after treatments, yet the difference decreased over time.
   Conversely, tree biomass C storage was lower in the burned NS (BNS) than
   in the unburned NS (UNS), although the difference was not significant.
   However, in the 6th year after treatments, the total plant biomass C
   storage was 14.56\% higher in the BEU than that in the UEU, and 59.93\%
   higher in the BNS than that in the UNS, respectively, although the
   significant difference was only found between UNS and BNS. In addition,
   neither SOC storage at 0-20cm nor ecosystem C storage in either the EU
   or NS was significantly affected by prescribed
   burning.ConclusionsPrescribed burning has little impact on overall C
   storage of forest ecosystems, we consider that prescribed burning may be
   an option for forest site preparation regarding plant biomass C
   accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{A 15-year post evaluation of the fire effects on ant community in an

   ant communities in areas of fire regime. Otherwise, little is known
   about the effects of fire on ant communities in areas of non-fire

   effect of fire on ant species richness in a rain forest (Bacaba Plateau)
   burned 15-years ago and compare our data with the data of primary
   unburned forest. A total of 85 ant species distributed in 21 genera and

   the litter and vegetation, respectively. The fire damaged forest studied
   supports an intermediate richness of ants when compared to a primary
   unburned rain forest in the same region. A comparative analysis of ant
   species richness showed that the Bacaba Plateau presented a different
   ant fauna when compared with the primary unburned forests, suggesting
   that fire can alter ant species composition. Although, our results

Abstract = {{An effective approach to increase forest health is to identify and
   validate a suite of indicators for monitoring forest conditions. We
   sought indicators of impacts due to deer browsing, prescribed burn,
   visitor use, and trails on understory plants beside trails in an
   oak-pine savanna in Finery Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Six
   commonly used ecological indicators were studied in 216 I-m x I-m
   quadrats located 0, 3, and 15 m from nine trails: plant species
   richness, stem density, species cover, proportion of native species,
   median height of selected tree seedlings, and proportion of foliar
   damage (insect herbivory) on leaves of neighboring trees. Three levels
   of visiter use, two of deer densities, and two of prescribed burns were
   used in analysis. Plant stem density and cover per quadrat were
   sensitive to the effects of deer density, prescribed burn, and visitor
   use. The proportion of native species per quadrat was affected by
   prescribed burn, distance from trail edge, and visitor use. The number
   of nonnative species increased along trail edges, but numbers of native
   species were similar throughout. Plant species richness, median seedling
   height, and proportion of foliar herbivory per quadrat were only
   sensitive to deer density. Higher deer densities led to significant
   declines in species richness, stem density, cover, and median seedling
   height. Prescribed burns proved to be beneficial to the forest, with
   stem density and cover increasing in burned areas, although the
   proportion of exotic species also increased in burned areas.
   Surprisingly, high visitor use had a moderately positive impact on the
   forest, with density and cover increasing on trails with high visitor
   use, and proportion of native species highest on trails with moderate
   visitor use. Of the indicators studied in the park, stem density, cover,
   and the proportion of native species responded strongly to browsing,
   fire, visitor use, and trail impacts. Similar studies at other parks
   would help managers to focus long-term monitoring efforts on the most
   sensitive site-specific indicators.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of vascular plant species in riparian
   communities was compared between three levels of disturbance in the
   adjacent upland vegetation. Comparisons were made between riparian zone
   sites that were undisturbed, sites where clearcuts were separated from
   the riparian zone by a buffer of upland forest, and sites where a forest
   fire had burned to the riparian zone-upland ecotone. No significant
   differences in the overall abundance and distribution of species in the
   riparian vegetation were found between the three disturbance classes,
   though a small number of species appeared to increase in abundance at
   burn sites. These results demonstrate that disturbances in the upland
   forest do not seriously impact the riparian zone plant community, likely
   because the riparian species are adapted to a high-light environment and
   flooding disturbance. The environmental factors that change in the
   riparian zone following removal of the adjacent forest canopy, including
   light levels, temperature, and wind penetration, do not appear to have a
   significant influence on the riparian zone vegetation. These results

   stand structure (stem density, basal area, and stocking) by species
   group, ingrowth during the first 15 years of the study, and mortality
   during the first 35 years within an oak-hickory forest of the Missouri
   Ozarks. The study included an unburned control treatment (Control),
   burning with one-year return intervals (Annual), and burning with
   four-year return intervals (Periodic) throughout the study duration. At
   the stand level, stem density decreased through time across all
   treatments. Periodic burning increased the rate at which mortality
   occurred for small-diameter stems, but after 35 years, the mortality of
   small-diameter stems exceeded 70\% across all treatments. There was
   little evidence of ingrowth for either burn treatment, but ingrowth
   increased the prevalence of non-oak species through time on the Control
   plots. On burned plots, basal area was maintained (Periodic) or slightly
   increased (Annual) during the study, primarily due to growth of trees
   that were present at the start of the study. However, stand stocking
   decreased with prescribed burning and increased in the Control plots,
   moving burned plots towards woodland structure while unburned plots
   remained as forests. Repeated burning without a fire-free interval can
   approximate structural conditions associated with woodlands, but
   suspends tree regeneration and recruitment processes necessary for

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Tree hollows are a key habitat component for a large number of
   Australian vertebrates and understanding how these resources are used is
   critical for developing successful management and conservation
   strategies for particular species or sets of species. Some hollow-using
   vertebrates are capable of using other kinds of nest sites. The common
   ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) is one of these species and
   it is known to use tree hollows and also to construct nests (dreys) made
   from sticks and leaves. Nest site selection by P. peregrinus may be a
   function of hollow availability. This proposition and several related
   questions were tested in a radio-tracking study that examined patterns
   of tree hollow and drey use by P. peregrinus in a range of vegetation
   types in Booderee National Park in Jervis Bay Territory. In addition,
   this study explored whether hollow and drey use was influenced by a
   wildfire that occurred in the study region in late 2003. It was found
   that use of hollows or dreys appeared to be a function of the
   availability of these resources. Most individuals were either primarily
   hollow users or primarily drey users. These patterns conformed to
   differences we recorded in hollow abundance between vegetation types:
   drey use was most pronounced in shrubland where hollows were rare and
   hollow use was most prevalent in forest where hollows were abundant. We
   found no evidence to suggest that hollow or drey use was influenced by
   fire. There was a trend pattern in our data suggesting that home-range
   size of P. peregrinus was larger in burnt versus unburnt sites but this
   effect was not statistically significant. Evidence was found that P.
   peregrinus selected particular kinds of trees as nest sites. Hollows in
   dead trees were more often used than those in living trees. Smaller
   dreys were most likely to be used. Several kinds of nest-selection
   effects that were contrary to the findings of studies of other arboreal
   marsupials were identified. These included more frequent use of smaller
   diameter trees with fewer cavities. The reasons for these unexpected
   results remain unclear. Findings such as those quantifying gender
   differences in the frequency of drey use, as well as marked
   between-vegetation-type differences in nest-type selection, indicate
   that nest use and nesting behaviour in P. peregrinus may be more complex
   than previously recognised. These findings also indicate that a deep
   understanding of the nesting biology of a species may require careful
   studies of both sexes, across a range of environments, and where
   disturbances have and have not occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Heathlands are a peculiar habitat of western Europe, and have markedly
   declined over the last decades. Most of the remaining fragments are now
   protected, but are still threatened by the encroachment of pioneer trees
   such as Betula pendula Roth and Populus tremula L. Prescribed fire and
   mechanical cutting are commonly used to control pioneer trees in
   northern countries, but there is little understanding of their effects
   towards the southern edge of the range of European heathlands. I report
   the results of 14 years of monitoring in a network of permanent plots
   located in the Vauda, one of the largest lowland heathlands in Italy.
   Even at high frequencies (> 3 burns in 14 years) fire did not control
   the expansion of pioneer trees. Actually, at frequencies of 1-2 burns in
   14 years, fire stimulated the expansion of pioneer trees. The growth of
   pioneer trees was rapid: grassland might be completely lost from the
   Vauda Nature Reserve in as little as 15 years. Only yearly mechanical
   cutting was able to control woody plants, while in mown plots cover of
   C. vulgaris ranged between 7\% and 19\% through the study. This work
   shows that management of southern European lowland heathlands must be
   more intensive than what is usually applied in north-European contexts,
   because fire alone cannot control pioneer trees. Rather, combinations of
   prescribed fire, mowing and increasing grazing/browsing will be
   necessary to achieve long term conservation of heathlands where fast
   rates of scrub and woodland encroachment is observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The boreal forest contains large reserves of carbon. Across this region,
   wildfires influence the temporal and spatial dynamics of carbon storage.
   In this study, we estimate fire emissions and changes in carbon storage
   for boreal North America over the 21st century. We use a gridded data
   set developed with a multivariate adaptive regression spline approach to
   determine how area burned varies each year with changing climatic and
   fuel moisture conditions. We apply the process-based Terrestrial
   Ecosystem Model to evaluate the role of future fire on the carbon
   dynamics of boreal North America in the context of changing atmospheric
   carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and climate in the A2 and B2
   emissions scenarios of the CGCM2 global climate model. Relative to the
   last decade of the 20th century, decadal total carbon emissions from
   fire increase by 2.5-4.4 times by 2091-2100, depending on the climate
   scenario and assumptions about CO2 fertilization. Larger fire emissions
   occur with warmer climates or if CO2 fertilization is assumed to occur.
   Despite the increases in fire emissions, our simulations indicate that
   boreal North America will be a carbon sink over the 21st century if CO2
   fertilization is assumed to occur in the future. In contrast,
   simulations excluding CO2 fertilization over the same period indicate
   that the region will change to a carbon source to the atmosphere, with
   the source being 2.1 times greater under the warmer A2 scenario than the
   B2 scenario. To improve estimates of wildfire on terrestrial carbon
   dynamics in boreal North America, future studies should incorporate the
   role of dynamic vegetation to represent more accurately post-fire
   successional processes, incorporate fire severity parameters that change
   in time and space, account for human influences through increased fire
   suppression, and integrate the role of other disturbances and their
   interactions with future fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{In Pacific Northwest prairies and oak woodlands, cessation of
   anthropogenic burning in the mid-1800s resulted in large-scale
   degradation and loss of habitat due to tree and shrub encroachment.
   Widespread invasive species, deep thatch accumulations, and extensive
   moss cover now limit the ability of native plants to germinate and
   thrive. These changes in habitat structure and function have contributed
   to the decline of several plant and animal species. Over the past
   decade, prescribed fire has been increasingly applied throughout the
   Willamette Valley-Puget Trough-Georgia Basin Ecoregion and used in
   conjunction with other techniques (herbicide, seeding native species) to
   restore native habitat with variable results. This variability likely is
   a result of differential fire intensity, dictated by fuels, weather and
   application technique, all of which can be controlled for by altering
   fire season, fire frequency, pre-fire treatments and fire extent. In
   order to burn at the spatial and temporal scales necessary for effective
   habitat restoration, however, prescribed burn programs must overcome
   several socio-political, programmatic and economic challenges. This
   requires a collaborative approach to prescribed fire training,
   implementation and research. Future research on fire season, fire
   frequency, species-specific responses to fire and effects of fire
   surrogates on ecosystem structure and functioning will help to refine
   prescribed fire management for maximum effectiveness in prairie and oak
   woodland restoration.}},

   events such as fire influence habitat use is crucial to wildlife
   management. Relationships between home-range size of long-nosed
   bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) and vegetation type and fire effects on
   food availability and vegetation cover were explored. Home ranges and
   movement of P. nasuta were mapped in burnt and unburnt vegetation using
   radio-tracking. Compositional analysis was used to study their habitat
   associations. In 2004, six months after wildfire, no significant
   relationships were found between home-range size and vegetation type. In
   2005, there was a preference for dry and wet forest over heath and
   disturbed areas. In both years, in ranges that contained both burnt and
   unburnt vegetation, there was a preference for unburnt vegetation.
   Home-range size was positively related to the bodyweight of individuals.
   Fire did not significantly alter home-range size, but did influence the
   way animals used their home range. Dense understorey might provide vital
   shelter from predators, and may be particularly important after fire.
   Wildfire and prescribed burning are major forms of disturbance in many

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Prescribed fire has been used in a coordinated manner to manage fuels in
   eucalypt forests of southern Australia since the 1950s. The impetus for
   planned use of fire arose from the need to reduce the impact of
   extensive, high intensity fires on life, property and commercial forest
   values. Prescribed fire is increasingly recognised as also playing an
   important role in mitigating undesirable effects of high intensity fires
   on environmental values including soil, water and biodiversity. Critical
   elements for an effective prescribed fire program include a sound
   understanding of fire behaviour, an experienced and flexible workforce,
   and organisational commitment to adaptive management involving planning,
   monitoring and applied research. Implementation of prescribed fire
   programs has been closely linked with, and dependent upon, the
   development of burning guides for particular forest types through
   empirical field research. The contribution of prescribed fire to
   mitigating the effects of extensive, high intensity fires can be
   quantified in a variety of ways using basic combustion science,
   well-documented case studies, analysis of fire statistics, and
   simulation. Fuel reduction can improve the safety, efficiency and
   effectiveness of fire suppression, although these effects may be subtle
   and difficult to measure. Social and political factors can significantly
   influence the conduct and effectiveness of prescribed fire programs, and
   effective engagement with the community during planning, implementation
   and post-fire monitoring phases is essential to ensure that the role of
   prescribed fire in land management is properly recognised and
   understood. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{306-316}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are anticipated to increase in frequency and extent in the
   Arctic tundra. In the unprecedented 2010 fire season, 37 tundra fires
   burned 435km(2) of the Noatak National Preserve, Alaska. We sampled
   sixteen soil monoliths from four of these burned areas, which based on
   microsite burn severity assessments ranged from scorched to
   moderate-high. Surface charcoals were later studied using reflectance
   microscopy, as charcoal reflectance may semiquantitatively indicate the
   duration of heating experienced by a given fuel. Here, the combination
   of high fuel moisture contents and rapid consumption of fine tussock
   fuels likely resulted in short fire residence times across the four
   burned areas, giving an overall low median charcoal reflectance for the
   entire assemblage (0.82\%Ro(median)). The low charcoal reflectances of
   the ground fuels provide further evidence for limited heat transference
   to the organic soil (bryophytes, 0.57 +/- 0.17\%Ro(median); duff and
   litter, 0.83 +/- 0.33\%Ro(median)). The range of observed microsite burn
   severities is therefore likely attributable to localised variations in
   above- and ground fuel moisture contents resulting in heterogeneously
   burned fuels. Consequently, charcoal reflectance is able to provide
   additional information about current fire behaviour that may improve our
   understanding of tussock-shrub tundra fires in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Fire intensity is recognised as an important driver of regeneration
   dynamics in forest and shrubland vegetation types, but its effects on

   used fire severity as a surrogate measure of fire intensity, and
   compared post-fire seedling recruitment from arid Triodia pungens (soft
   spinifex) plots burnt by low-severity experimental fires against those
   burnt by a high-severity wildfire. To explain T. pungens recruitment
   patterns, we also: (1) conducted a longitudinal depth distribution study
   of soil seedbank densities, and (2) carried out a lethal-temperature
   experiment on T. pungens seeds. High-severity burning was associated
   with reduced T. pungens recruitment compared with low-severity fire, and
   this relationship was attributed to the low lethal temperature
   thresholds of seeds and the adverse impacts of elevated soil
   temperatures during high-severity fire on the shallow soil seedbank.
   Among other species in the community, there were varied recruitment
   responses to fire severity. Overall, our results indicate that a strong

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{643-657}},

Abstract = {{Large, high-severity wildfires alter the physical and biological
   conditions that determine how catchments retain and release nutrients
   and regulate streamwater quality. The short-term water quality impacts
   of severe wildfire are often dramatic, but the longer-term responses may
   better reflect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem recovery. We followed
   streamwater chemistry for 14years after the largest fire in recorded
   Colorado history, the 2002 Hayman Fire, to characterize patterns in
   nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) export. Throughout the post-fire period,
   stream nitrate and total dissolved N (TDN) remained elevated in 10
   burned catchments relative to pre-burn periods and 4 unburned control
   catchments. Both the extent of fire in a catchment and wildfire severity
   influenced stream N concentrations. Nitrate was more than an order of
   magnitude higher in streams draining catchments that burned to a high
   extent (>60\% of their areas) compared to unburned catchments. Unburned
   catchments retained more than 95\% of atmospheric N inputs, but N
   retention in burned catchments was less than half of N inputs. Unlike N,
   stream C was elevated in catchments that burned to a lesser extent
   (30-60\% of their areas burned), compared to either unburned or
   extensively burned catchments. Remotely sensed estimates of upland and
   riparian vegetation cover suggest that burned forests could require
   several more decades before forest cover and nutrient demand return to
   pre-fire levels. The persistent stream N increases we report are below
   drinking water thresholds, but exceed ecoregional reference
   concentrations for healthy stream ecosystems and indicate that
   extensively burned headwater catchments no longer function as strong
   sinks for atmospheric N. Combined with increasing trends in wildfire
   severity and elevated N deposition, our findings demonstrate the
   potential for substantial post-wildfire changes in ecosystem N retention
   and have implications for nutrient export to downstream waters.}},

   PB using a combination of dendroecological, anatomical, hydraulic and
   isotopic analyses. Tree-ring widths, xylem cell wall thickness, lumen
   area, hydraulic diameter and tree ring delta C-13 and delta O-18 were
   measured in trees on burned and control sites. Vulnerability curves were
   elaborated to assess tree hydraulic efficiency or safety. Despite the
   relatively intense thermal treatment (the residence time of temperatures
   above 50 degrees C at the stem surface ranged between 242 and 2239 s),
   burned trees did not suffer mechanical damage to stems, nor significant
   reduction in radial growth. Moreover, the PB did not affect xylem
   structure and tree hydraulics. No variations in C-13-derived water use
   efficiency were recorded. This confirmed the high resistance of P. pinea
   to surface fire at the stem base. However, burned trees showed
   consistently lower 6180 values in the PB year, as a likely consequence
   of reduced competition for water and nutrients due to the understory
   burning, which increased both photosynthetic activity and stomatal
   conductance. Our multi-approach analysis offers new perspectives on
   post-fire survival strategies of P. pinea in an environment where fires

   we combine airborne LiDAR and multispectral imagery to assess postfire
   regeneration types in a spatially continuous way, using a Mediterranean
   black pine (Pinus nigra Arn ssp. salzmannii) forest that burned in 1998
   as a case study. Five postfire regeneration types were obtained by
   clustering field-plot data using Ward's method. Two of the five
   regeneration types presented high tree cover (one clearly dominated by
   hardwoods and the other dominated by pines), a third type presented low
   to moderate tree cover, being dominated by hardwoods, and the remaining
   two types matched to areas dominated by soil-herbaceous or shrub layers
   with very low or no tree cover (i.e., very low to no tree species
   regeneration). These five types of regeneration were used to conduct a
   supervised classification of remote sensing data using a nonparametric
   supervised classification technique. Compared with independent field
   validation points, the remote sensing based assessment method resulted
   in a global classification accuracy of 82.7\%. Proportions of
   regeneration types in the study area indicated a general shift from the

Abstract = {{The impacts of silvicultural disturbance (felling and burning) on

   presence-absence data for 452 taxa from 52 sampling events, spanning
   unlogged forest and disturbed, regenerating forest about 1, 3 and 5
   years after disturbance. Three aspects of species composition were
   compared: total species richness, occurrence of pre-disturbance species
   in the post-disturbance flora and relative richness of ecological groups
   in the flora. Total species richness was the least reliable measure for
   evaluating changes due to disturbance.
   Felling and burning in different combinations were represented in a
   range of silvicultural treatments applied in the study area. They
   produced different levels of disturbance and different microhabitats,
   and thereby defined the character of the cryptogamic flora. The most
   severe impacts occurred at burnt sites, regardless of whether the forest
   had been felled or not, and the least impact was found in standing,
   unburnt forest.
   The consequences of severe disturbance were a substantial change in
   species composition, with a reduction, in particular, of mature wet
   forest species in favour of species associated with disturbance or
   brightly lit, exposed environments. In the lichens, the loss of old tree
   indicators, old forest indicators, foliicolous species, rare species of
   conservation significance and species indicative of a succession towards
   cool temperate rainforest was especially severe. Mosses and liverworts
   also showed a very pronounced loss of mature wet forest species. In the
   mosses, the presence of newcomers, represented mostly by disturbance
   species or species typical of open drier conditions, masked the extent
   of these losses. In the liverworts, there were few newcomers and the
   composition of the post-disturbance flora was much depleted.}},

Abstract = {{Unburnt patches within a fire boundary may act as refuges for fauna,
   facilitating their survival and persistence within fire-prone
   landscapes. Unburnt patches can arise due to various processes,
   including topographic variation, fire behaviour, and fuel reduction from
   recent burning. However, the value of unburnt patches of differing
   characteristics to the post-fire persistence of faunal communities has
   rarely been examined. In this study, we examined the relative importance
   of fire history and severity in predicting the occurrence of birds in a
   burnt forest landscape. We conducted surveys in mixed eucalypt forest of
   south-east Australia, 2-3 years after a high intensity, landscape-scale
   wildfire (>200,000 ha). Sites (n = 91) were selected to encompass fire
   severity ranging from unburnt patches to stands of crown-burnt forest.
   Fire history prior to the wildfire was defined as short (<3 years) or
   long (>20 years) time-since-fire. Unburnt patches of long
   time-since-fire were important avian refuges, harbouring 20-40\% more
   species, up to 56\% more individuals and an assemblage that was distinct
   from that at all sites burnt by the wildfire, including low severity
   ground fire. No difference in species richness or composition was
   detected between sites in unburnt patches of short or long
   time-since-fire; but bird abundance was 20\% lower in patches of short
   time-since-fire. Unburnt and ground-burnt patches of short
   time-since-fire provided habitat for more species and had distinct
   assemblages from that of severely burnt sites. For sites severely burnt
   in the wildfire, there was no difference in avifaunal richness,
   abundance or composition between those burnt twice in rapid succession
   and those not burnt for >20 years. Together, these results highlight:
   (1) the particular importance of unburnt vegetation remaining within
   fire-affected areas as faunal refuges, and (2) the potential for recent
   planned burns to contribute to refuge habitat if it avoids severe
   burning in a subsequent wildfire. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   overstory units. To study effects of tree thinning, we analyzed
   relationships of overstory stand density (Reineke's SDI) and
   current-year branch length. number of branches, and biomass, and also
   evaluated the importance of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky
   Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) herbivory (Browsing) as a predictor in
   linear models. To study effects of prescribed fire, we examined
   mortality, seedling emergence, and growth response on experimentally
   burned and unburned plots. SDI and browsing were significantly and
   negatively correlated with F. ceanothus current-year branch length,
   biomass, and leaf area but relationships were generally weak. Across the
   4 years, browsing appeared to be consistently more important than SDI in
   explaining variation in growth. Although SDI and browsing were
   significant predictors of growth in years with near normal
   precipitation, models failed in drought years. Burning resulted in
   17-32\% mortality whereas 0-5\% of plants died on unburned plots.
   Mortality of burned plants was positively related to amount of forest
   floor consumed during prescribed fires. One growing season after fire,
   surviving burned plants responded by producing long resprouts.
   Current-year branches were consistently longer on burned than unburned
   plants only where plots were protected from large herbivores. Unburned
   plants had more current-year branches and greater biomass than burned
   plants. No seedlings emerged on unburned plots but were found on 44\% of
   burned plots. A quadratic function represented the relationship between
   seedling emergence and forest floor consumption. Our results suggest
   that restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests of nor-them
   Arizona can help increase abundance of F. ceanothus but population
   responses may be slow, particularly when constrained by ungulate
   herbivory, fire-related mortality of plants and dormant seeds. and

Abstract = {{Soil water repellency can impact soil hydrology, overland flow
   generation and associated soil losses. However, current hydrological
   models do not take it into account, which creates a challenge in
   repellency-prone regions. This work focused on the adaptation for soil
   water repellency of a daily water balance model. Repellency is estimated
   from soil moisture content using site-specific empirical relations and
   used to limit maximum soil moisture. This model was developed and tested
   using approximately 2 years of data from one long-unburned and two
   recently burned eucalypt plantations in northern Portugal, all of which
   showed strong seasonal soil water repellency cycles. Results indicated
   important improvements for the burned plantations, with the
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency increasing from -0.55 and -0.49 to 0.55 and
   0.65. For the unburned site, model performance was already good without
   the modification and efficiency only improved slightly from 0.71 to
   0.74, mostly due to the better simulation of delayed soil wetting after
   dry periods. Results suggested that even a simple approach to simulate
   soil water repellency can markedly improve the performance of
   hydrological models in eucalypt forests, especially after fire.

   Eurasian boreal forest, which showed greater drought sensitivity due to
   characteristic warmer, drier growing seasons relative to other areas.
   The NEE response to climate variability and fire was mitigated by
   compensating changes in GPP and respiration, though NEE carbon losses
   were generally observed in areas with severe drought or burning. Drought
   and temperature variations also had larger regional impacts on GPP and
   NEE than fire during the study period, though fire disturbances were
   heterogeneous, with larger impacts on carbon fluxes for some areas and

Abstract = {{The cover and extent of boreal broadleaved forests have been decreasing
   due to modern forest management practices and fire suppression. As
   decomposers of woody material, polypores are ecologically important
   ecosystem engineers. The ecology and conservation biology of polypores
   have been studied intensively in boreal coniferous forests. However,
   only a few studies have focused on the species living on broadleaved
   trees. To increase knowledge on this species group we conducted polypore
   surveys in 27 broadleaved forests and 303 forest compartments (539 ha)
   on the southern boreal zone in Finland and measured dead wood and forest
   characteristics. We detected altogether 98 polypore species, of which 13
   are red-listed in Finland. 60\% of the recorded species are primarily
   associated with broadleaved trees. The number of species in a local
   community present in a broadleaved forest covered approximately 50
   species, of which 30-40 were primarily associated with broadleaved
   trees. The size of the inventoried area explained 67\% of the variation
   in the species richness, but unlike in previous studies conducted in
   coniferous forests, dead wood variables as well as forest structure had
   very limited power in explaining polypore species richness on forest
   stand level. The compartments occupied by red listed Protomerulius
   caryae had an especially high volume of living birch, but otherwise the
   occurrences of red-listed species could not be predicted based on the

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-89}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A widely-used description of vegetation response to fire is that species
   can be clearly classified as sprouters or non-sprouters. We aimed to
   assess: (1) how well this dichotomous classification
   (sprouter/non-sprouter) described the responses of a semi-arid flora to
   experimental disturbance; (2) how similar were sprouting responses to
   treatments mimicking intense herbivory and fire; (3) how well
   easily-measured traits could predict sprouting. Sprouting was assessed
   for 45 species from a range of growth forms (grasses, forbs, sub-shrubs,
   woody shrubs and trees) from semi-arid south-eastern Australia. We used
   two treatments: clipping at stem base, and clipping followed by burning
   with a blowtorch.
   A dichotomy accounted for >60\% of deviance explained by species
   identity. Models with three or four groups were not substantially
   better. The dichotomy was not between 0\% and 100\% sprouting, rather
   between `weak' and `strong' sprouters. Probabilities of sprouting for
   weak sprouters were 23\% after clipping and 6\% after burning, while
   strong sprouters had sprouting probabilities of 90\% after clipping and
   79\% after burning. While sprouting varied in space and time, the
   dichotomy was robust to this variation. Sprouting ability increased with
   size in most of the species with variable sprouting.
   Sprouting was partially related to growth form; grasses sprouted
   strongly, chenopods weakly, and forb and woody species covered the range
   of sprouting. Strong sprouters were likely to have more stems per plant,
   greater basal area, shorter potential height and deeper buds than weak
   sprouters. A hierarchical model that used growth form and then
   stems-per-plant provided a simple, robust predictor of sprouting.
   Four-fifths of species responded consistently to clipping and burning
   while one-fifth of species were strong sprouters after clipping but weak
   sprouters after burning. Burning reduced sprouting most in intermediate
   sprouters. Differences between sprouting after clipping and burning
   reflected increased intensity and were related to the depth of buds
   below ground.}},

   Of prescribed fire on gap fraction in an oak forest understory on the
   Cumberland Plateau. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 132: 432-441. 2005-Excessive
   shade in the understory has been widely cited as the most important
   factor causing poor oak regeneration in eastern deciduous forests. We
   examined the effect of single and multiple fires on forest stand
   structure and the consequent impacts on the gap fraction measured in the
   understory. Differences in midstory stem density (stems 2-15 cm diameter
   at breast height; DBH) before and after prescribed burning were highly
   correlated with fire frequency (R-2 = 0.86, P < 0.01). On average, each
   additional burn reduced midstory stem density by similar to 550 stems
   per hectare. Hemispherical photography showed an increase of 3.8 \% in
   understory gap fraction in the first growing season after burning. This
   increase in gap fraction, which was likely caused by the thinning of the
   midstory by prescribed burning, was quickly reduced in the next year.
   Decreases in gap fraction after the first year post-fire, which
   indicated progressive canopy closure, cannot be explained by the
   relatively stable midstory stem density in subsequent years after fire.
   Rather, the decreases in gap fraction after fire coincided with a rapid
   increase in stem density in the shrub stratum (> 50 cm in height and < 2
   cm DBH) of more than two thousand stems/ha/year. The rapid flush of
   stump sprouts in the shrub stratum was the primary cause of the decrease
   in the understory gap fraction. Land managers whose goal is to improve
   oak regeneration by increasing the understory light environment through
   the use of prescribed burning will need to control the flush of stump
   sprouts to maintain the effectiveness of burning in increasing light
   availability. Multiple fires of the intensity used in this study failed
   to permanently reduce sprouts.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread degradation of tropical forests is caused by a variety of
   disturbances that interact in ways that are not well understood. To
   explore potential synergies between edge effects, fire and windstorm
   damage as causes of Amazonian forest degradation, we quantified
   vegetation responses to a 30-min, high-intensity windstorm that in 2012,
   swept through a large-scale fire experiment that borders an agricultural
   field. Our pre- and postwindstorm measurements include tree mortality
   rates and modes of death, above-ground biomass, and airborne LiDAR-based
   estimates of tree heights and canopy disturbance (i.e., number and size
   of gaps). The experimental area in the southeastern Amazonia includes
   three 50-ha plots established in 2004 that were unburned (Control),
   burned annually (B1yr), or burned at 3-year intervals (B3yr). The
   windstorm caused greater damage to trees (>10 cm DBH) in the burned
   plots (B1yr: 13 +/- 9\% of 785 trees; B3yr: 17 +/- 13\% of 433) than in
   the Control plot (8 +/- 4\% of 2,300; +/- CI). It substantially reduced
   vegetation height by 14\% in B1yr, 20\% in B3yr and 12\% in the Control
   plots, while it reduced above-ground biomass by 18\% of 77.7 Mg/ha
   (B1yr), 31\% of 56.6 (B3yr), and 15\% of 120 (Control). Tree damage was
   greatest near the agricultural field edge in all three plots, especially
   among large trees and in B3yr. Trunk snapping (70\%) and uprooting
   (20\%) were the most common modes of tree damage and mortality, with the
   height of trunk failure on the burned plots often corresponding with the
   height of historical fire scars. Of the windstorm-damaged trees, 80\%
   (B1yr), 90\% (B3yr), and 57\% (Control) were dead 4 years later. Trees
   that had crown damage experienced the least mortality (22\%-60\%),
   followed by those that were snapped (55\%-94\%) and uprooted
   (88\%-94\%). Synthesis. We demonstrate the synergistic effects of three
   kinds of disturbances on a tropical forest. Our results show that the
   effects of windstorms are exacerbated by prior degradation by fire and
   fragmentation. We highlight that understorey fires can produce
   long-lasting effects on tropical forests not only by directly killing
   trees but also by increasing tree vulnerability to wind damage due to
   fire scars and a more open canopy.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation in the tropics is often followed by the creation of
   anthropogenic savannas used for animal husbandry. By discontinuing
   burning regimes, forests may recolonize the savanna and carbon stocks
   may recover. However, little is known about the success and speed of
   tropical forest recovery, while such information is vital for a better
   quantification of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and
   forest degradation (REDD +) as well as supporting Forest Landscape
   Restoration (FLR) practices. Therefore, we designed a forest
   regeneration experiment within a savanna patch in the Mayombe hills
   (Democratic Republic of Congo), by discontinuing the annual burning
   regime in an 88 ha exclosure since 2005. 101 permanent inventory plots
   (40.4 ha) were installed in 2010 and remeasured in 2014. Tree species
   were classified as savanna or forest specialists. We estimate a forest
   specialist encroachment rate of 9 stems ha(-1) yr(-1) and a savanna
   specialist disappearance rate of 16 stems ha(-1) yr(-1). Average
   diameter of forest specialists did not change due to an increasing
   influx of recruits, while average diameter of savanna trees increased
   due to decreasing recruitment. Carbon stored by forest specialists

   recovery rate of 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Using the average carbon stock
   of 19 nearby mature rainforest plots as a reference, we estimate a total
   forest carbon recovery time of at least 150 years. The Manzonzi
   exclosure may potentially become an important reference experiment to
   quantify REDD + schemes in Central Africa. Furthermore, this natural
   regeneration experiment demonstrates how carbon sequestration and
   biodiversity conservation can go hand-in-hand. However, more censuses
   are needed to better quantify the long-term carbon recovery trajectory

Abstract = {{Soil water repellency (SWR) is a dynamic soil property that influences
   soil hydrology. The main goal of this work was to determine in situ
   spatial and temporal variations in SWR in six recently burnt eucalypt
   stands with different pre- and post-fire management. The severity of SWR
   was measured in the field using the ``molarity of an ethanol droplet
   test{''} during 1-2 years, at intervals of 1-2 weeks. Measurements were
   taken for the ash layer, soil surface and three different soil depths
   (2-3, 7-8 and 14-16 cm). The volumetric soil moisture content (SMC) was
   measured at the three deepest layers. The results showed that ploughing
   operations carried out several years before the fire did not have major
   impacts on the severity of SWR. The ash layer was predominately
   wettable, whereas the other soil layers were dominated by strong to
   extreme severity SWR. Furthermore, and starting at a soil depth of 3 cm,
   the severity of repellency decreased with increasing depth. The spatial
   variability within a slope was significant on half of the sampling days,
   indicating that wettable patches were present under median severely
   repellent conditions, possibly increasing hydrological connectivity
   within the slopes. Temporal SWR patterns were inversely related to
   antecedent rainfall and SMC. The SWR patterns were similar between
   sites, as well as for the different sampling depths within each site.
   Major changes in the median levels of repellency were registered in
   periods as short as 1-2 weeks, but measured rainfall and/or soil
   moisture conditions were insufficient to explain these changes.

Abstract = {{Thinning of conifers followed by pile burning has become a popular
   treatment to reduce fuel loads in the Lake Tahoe Basin, USA. However,
   concern has been voiced about burning within or near riparian areas
   because of the potential effect on nutrient release and, ultimately,
   lake water quality. Our objective was to quantify the effects of pile
   burning on soil physical and chemical properties and resulting
   near-stream surface and subsurface water chemistry. Twenty-seven
   hand-built piles of three contrasting fuelbed types (large wood,
   mixed-diameter slash, small-diameter slash) were burned. Burn sites were
   located throughout the basin and included both granitic and volcanic
   parent materials as well as glacial out-wash. We suspected that
   post-fire changes in soil physical and chemical properties would ensue
   as maximum soil surface temperatures averaged 400 degrees C for all pile
   types and exceeded 200 degrees C for >30 h beneath large-wood piles.
   Post-fire soil water repellency was greatest for large-wood piles, yet
   increased for all pile types when soil moisture content fell below a
   threshold of 7 \% to 10 \% during the dry summer season. Soil bulk
   density increased moderately whereas water infiltration rates decreased
   more than fourfold after burning of large-wood piles and mixed-slash
   piles. Surface runoff and subsurface flow concentrations of nitrate,
   phosphate, and sulfate were measured downslope from the piles at 6 mo
   and 18 mo after burning. Mean NO3, ortho-PO4, and SO4 concentrations
   were low (<10 mg L-1) at both sampling dates and typically declined
   downslope from the pile edge. The results showed that pile burning.
   regardless of fuel composition. had a limited effect on downslope water
   quality despite associated changes in soil physicochemical properties.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Fire regulates the structure and function of savanna ecosystems, yet we
   lack understanding of how cyclic fire affects savanna carbon dynamics.
   Furthermore, it is largely unknown how predicted changes in climate may
   impact the interaction between fire and carbon cycling in these
   ecosystems. This study utilizes a novel combination of prescribed fire,
   eddy covariance (EC) and statistical techniques to investigate carbon
   dynamics in frequently burned longleaf pine savannas along a gradient of
   soil moisture availability (mesic, intermediate and xeric). This
   research approach allowed us to investigate the complex interactions
   between carbon exchange and cyclic fire along the ecological amplitude
   of longleaf pine. Over three years of EC measurement of net ecosystem
   exchange (NEE) show that the mesic site was a net carbon sink (NEE =
   -2.48 tonnes C ha 21), while intermediate and xeric sites were net
   carbon sources (NEE = 1.57 and 1.46 tonnes C ha(-1), respectively), but
   when carbon losses due to fuel consumption were taken into account, all
   three sites were carbon sources (10.78, 7.95 and 9.69 tonnes C ha(-1) at
   the mesic, intermediate and xeric sites, respectively). Nonetheless,
   rates of NEE returned to pre-fire levels 1-2 months following fire.
   Consumption of leaf area by prescribed fire was associated with
   reduction in NEE post-fire, and the system quickly recovered its carbon
   uptake capacity 30-60 days post fire. While losses due to fire affected
   carbon balances on short time scales (instantaneous to a few months),
   drought conditions over the final two years of the study were a more
   important driver of net carbon loss on yearly to multi-year time scales.
   However, longer-term observations over greater environmental variability
   and additional fire cycles would help to more precisely examine
   interactions between fire and climate and make future predictions about
   carbon dynamics in these systems.}},

Abstract = {{We studied post-fire Pinus albicaulis Engelm. seedling establishment in
   the Sleeping Child and Saddle Mountain burns of western Montana 26 and
   28 years, respectively, after fire. Pinus albicaulis seeds are dispersed
   primarily by Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana Wilson) in caches
   of 1-15 or more seeds. Consequently, P. albicaulis seedlings and trees
   often occur in clusters. In the Sleeping Child burn we collected
   regeneration data from 63 quadrats along a 3.6-km transect and from 14
   quadrats along a 20.6-km road transect; in the Saddle Mountain burn we
   collected data from 41 quadrats along a 3.2-km transect. We determined
   regression models for height versus age and age versus height
   relationships for P. albicaulis and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. and
   used the latter regression models to construct regeneration age
   structures for both bums. For both conifers a disproportionately high
   percentage of regeneration was established between 1977 and 1985, about
   17-25 years after fire. Thus, major regeneration was episodic. A small
   increase in mean seasonal rainfall between 1977 and 1985 possibly
   contributed to this recruitment surge. Age differences of 1-8 years
   occurred among seedlings in 65-86\% of the seedling and tree clusters
   sampled, suggesting delayed germination of some cached seeds. Pinus
   albicaulis regeneration was more frequently associated with Vaccinium
   scoparium Leiberg and less frequently associated with Xerophyllum tenax
   (Pursh) Nutt. and Luzula hitchcockii Hamet-Ahti relative to the overall
   frequency of occurrence of these plants among quadrats.}},

Abstract = {{Degraded grasslands resulting from intensive land use appear to be
   highly resistant to tree invasion due to interactions between land use,
   climate, grazing and fire. We describe long-term patterns of tropical
   montane forest regeneration into degraded grasslands and analyze their
   relationships with historical changes in rainfall, grazing and fire in
   Los Toldos valley (Northwest Argentina), cloud forest life zone (1600 m
   asl). We used dendrochronological techniques to reconstruct spatial and
   temporal patterns of Podocarpus parlatorei establishment (the dominant
   tree species in secondary forests) and grassland fires for the last 150
   yr. We assessed current livestock spatial distribution along the valley
   through feces sampling. Inferred tree establishment patterns (i.e.,
   considering age structure and mortality) were analyzed in relation to
   temporal and spatial patterns of grazing and fire derived from our own
   analyses and from government statistics, and to rainfall patterns
   derived from previous dendrochronological reconstructions. Current
   grazing intensity was higher close to the local township. Fire
   occurrence increased with periods of above-average rainfall (higher fuel
   productivity), and tended to increase with distance to township (less
   grazing). Tree establishment in grasslands was spatially associated with
   high grazing intensity and low fire frequency, and temporally associated
   with periods of high grazing intensity and below-average rainfall.
   Despite climatic and land-use changes leading to conditions potentially
   favorable for trees (i.e., more rainfall, less grazing), grasslands
   persist in this study area, likely due to the direct (saplings burning)
   and indirect (soil degradation and desiccation) effects of recurrent
   fires, enhanced by decreasing grazing and increasing rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{In grassland reserves, managed disturbance is often necessary to
   maintain plant species diversity. We carried out experiments to
   determine the impact of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing and disc
   ploughing on grassland species richness and composition in a nature
   reserve in semi-arid eastern Australia. Vegetation response was
   influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the
   experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn.
   Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the
   variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was
   greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or disc
   ploughing. In the fire experiment, species richness and composition
   recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species
   richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months
   of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass
   canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated
   by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on
   species richness and composition. Even disc ploughing caused only a
   small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was
   explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of
   the treatment, and the high degree of natural movement and cracking in
   these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of
   these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial
   species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears
   to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing
   ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent
   on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community.
   However, the ability of the Astrebla- and Dichanthium-dominated
   grasslands to recover quickly after disturbance, given favourable
   seasonal conditions, suggests that they are well adapted to natural
   disturbances (e.g. droughts, fire, flooding and native grazing).}},

   was recorded in forest stands burned in 1992 and 1994-2002 and compared
   with the nearby control fire untouched areas. We selected five burned

   conducted during July and August 2003. For vegetation description in
   each stand we systematically placed twenty 1 m x 1 m plots. Mann-Whitney
   nonparametric test was used to identify significant differences in

   as Agrostis capillaris L., Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth, Chamerion
   angustifolium (L.) Holub, Festuca ovina L. and Melampyrum pratense L.
   invaded in burned areas immediately after fire. Abundance of dominant

   cover-9 years after fire. Differences in moss species composition still

   Results showed few differences between real travel routes and
   straight-line routes during both high movement periods (post-calving to
   late winter and late winter to calving). Caribou selected less deciduous
   forest than available during early winter and spring but contrary to
   expectations they did not use more open areas and waterways than
   available. Possible migration corridors, or habitat used during early
   winter and spring, were not distinguished by one particular habitat
   type, although caribou were more likely to avoid water and open areas,
   while using more conifer forests. They did not avoid disturbed habitat
   such as recently burnt or cut areas. There were some sex-specific
   differences with mates using deciduous forest more than females. Caribou
   did not choose more than expected of waterways such as chains of lakes

Abstract = {{In this work, a revegetation experiment was performed on a forest soil
   artificially burnt in the laboratory, and the results of the soil
   without treatment were compared to those of the soil capped with an
   organic mulch. Plant biomass, as well as the variation of pH, electric
   conductivity (EC), and phytotoxicity with depth, were recorded. Only a
   very low plant growth was observed in the uncapped soil. The
   substrate-amended soil had a higher production than the uncapped soil,
   despite showing an increased EC due to the mulch. The increase of pH or
   salinity during burning can be discarded as the cause of the different
   plant growth, because the values reached were not high enough to justify
   the negative effect observed. The determination of phytotoxicity after
   burning the soil at temperatures between 100 degrees C and 500 degrees C
   suggested that the problems observed for seed germination in the burnt
   soil might be linked to the formation of undetermined phytotoxic
   substances after soil heating at a temperature near 200 degrees C.
   Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons followed the same trend as

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important management tool to increase herbaceous
   productivity and maintain seral communities of Intermountain sagebrush
   grasslands. Currently, pastures treated with prescribed fire are rested
   from livestock grazing before burning to allow fine fuel accumulation,

   This study examined the post-fire defoliation response of Agropyron
   spicatum and Sitanion hystrix to three different defoliation treatments:
   an early season defoliation during the boot phenological stage, late
   season defoliation after seedset, and non-defoliation. Plant response to
   these defoliation timings was compared to determine the amount of
   non-use required to restore vigor to these species following fire.
   Mortality was low for late and non-defoliated plants of both species.
   Results indicate no differences between late season and non-defoliated
   plants for biomass production, basal area, or culm number for Agropyron.
   No differences in Sitanion culm number resulted between the late and non
   defoliated treatments. Sitanion biomass production differed between late
   and non-defoliated treatments at Emmett, but not at Craters of the Moon.
   Basal area and culm number of late and non-defoliated plants of both

Abstract = {{The genus Astraeus (Diplocystidiaceae) forms ectomycorrhizal
   associations with many tree species and is a common gasteromycete in
   tropical and temperate ecosystems worldwide. In Thailand, Astraeus is
   most prevalent in deciduous dipterocarpoak forest (DOF) in the north and
   north-east and its ecology is uniquely associated with fire. Rural
   villagers often burn the seasonally dry DOF ground vegetation causing
   significant environmental disturbance to promote the growth of Astraeus
   sporocraps-a local culinary delicacy and important source of household
   income. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether the practice
   of burning DOF stimulates the production of Astraeus sporocarps in DOF.
   Burned and unburned Astraeus habitat was surveyed over two years at two
   sites in Chiang Mai province and one site in Mae Hong Son province.
   Changes in soil fungi after a fire as well as vascular vegetation
   growing with Astraeus were studied. All sporocarps collected were
   identified as Astraeus odoratus. Astraeus sporocarps were found in both
   burned and unburned areas in 2010. In 2011, an unusually wet year, no
   sporocarps were found in burned or unburned areas. The top 2 cm of soil
   experienced high temperatures which killed fungi, but lower depths were
   well insulated from the heat. A wide range of vascular flora grew in
   Astraeus habitat, the most common tree species being Dipterocarpus
   tuberculatus var. tuberculatus and Dipterocarpus obtusifolius var.
   obtusifolius. This study shows that Astraeus can produce sporocarps
   without fire and future work can focus on more environmentally benign
   methods of harvesting this popular mushroom.}},

Pages = {{328-335}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the combined impacts of fire and straw mulching, a
   widely used post-fire emergency measure, on the soil nitrogen (N) cycle.
   Unburnt (US) and severely-burnt soils without (BS) and with straw
   mulching (BSM) were preincubated (3 and 6 months) in the laboratory
   before fire and mulching effects on gross N transformations were
   investigated with a paired N-15-labelling experiment. The
   ammonium-to-nitrate (NH4+/NO3-) ratio of burnt soils decreased with
   preincubation time from 21 to 1.3, consistent with a shift of the N
   cycle towards net nitrification. After 3 months of preincubation, gross
   mineralisation (M-SON) and gross NH4+ immobilisation (I-NH4) in BS more
   than doubled compared to US, in the latter being M-SON 4.82 mg N kg(-1)
   day(-1) and I-NH4 3.01 mg N kg(-1) day(-1). Mulching partly mitigated
   this stimulation in the mineralisation-immobilisation turnover (MIT).
   After 6 months, MIT differences among treatments disappeared and gross
   rates approached those in US after 3 months. After three months,
   autotrophic nitrification (NH4+ oxidation) in all treatments was
   0.41-0.52 mg N kg(-1) day(-1), while after 6 months it remained similar
   in US but increased 8-fold in burnt soils. Heterotrophic nitrification
   of organic N only occurred in burnt soils, and its importance was
   similar to autotrophic nitrification after 3 months, but around 4-fold
   lower after 6 months. To conclude, burning opened up the N cycle and
   NO3- accumulated, increasing the potential for ecosystem N losses. In
   the short term, straw mulching slightly mitigates the effects of fire on
   the N cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Although the impact of ash on the hydrological and erosive response of
   burned soils has been studied in the last years, the effect of ash
   wettability on particle detachment by splash erosion has been rarely
   studied. In this research, we have studied the effect of wettable and
   water-repellent ash on the intensity of splash erosion after a
   prescribed burn in a Mediterranean shrubland. Runoff rates from wettable
   and water-repellent ash layers were also studied by rainfall simulation
   experiments (6 mm min(-1) during 10 min) at plot scale. Splash erosion
   experiments showed that the intensity of ash water repellency strongly
   conditioned the detachment and mobilization of ash and soil particles
   due to raindrop impacts in the post-fire. Although the intensity of
   water repellency and the amount of ash decreased through the
   experimental period, it was observed that splash erosion in originally
   water-repellent ash areas was about three times higher than in wettable
   ash areas. Plot-scale rainfall simulation experiments showed that runoff
   rates were much higher in water-repellent ash areas, where runoff rates
   increase with decreasing depth of the ash layer. In water-repellent ash
   areas, thick ash layers store a significant proportion of water that
   does not infiltrate soil, but contributes to relatively low runoff
   rates. In contrast, thin water-repellent ash layers are rapidly
   redistributed by rainfall, and the burned mineral soil surface is
   exposed. Pore clogging with fine water-repellent ash particles enhances
   runoff rates. During low or moderate intensity storms, patches of
   wettable/water-repellent ash arrange in a pattern that produces water
   infiltration/runoff generation areas, reducing the connectivity of water
   and sediments through the slope. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nutrient availability can be a limiting factor in the recovery of
   ecosystems after wildfire. Its evaluation is therefore critical for
   selecting appropriate restoration strategies in the post-fire period.
   This study explores, for the first time, the use of thermogravimetry
   (TG) as a rapid proxy for nutrient availability and soil recovery. Soil
   samples from five burned and unburned sites in Andisols of Tenerife
   (Spain) were selected to examine the medium-term impact of fire. Key
   soil chemical parameters {[}pH, electric conductivity, cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), main cation and anions in the soil solution, total
   organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus] were
   determined and thermogravimetry performed. Burned soils showed
   significantly higher pH, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and a lower CEC, TOC and TN than
   the unburned counterparts, and a site-dependent response for soluble
   SO42- and available phosphorus was observed in the medium term. Time
   elapsed since fire could have masked additional fire impacts.
   Thermogravimetry data allowed reasonable prediction of most soil
   properties and parameters, with r(2) ranging from 0.4 to 0.9. The
   results demonstrate that soluble nutrient content is directly related to
   the amount of ash in the soil. The decrease of labile carboxyl-C was
   associated with an increase of pH and decrease of CEC, whereas the
   increase of recalcitrant and refractory pools was associated with the
   amount of TOC and TN. The results suggest that this novel application of
   an established method can provide, following an initial calibration
   step, rapid and inexpensive proxies for key parameters necessary for
   assessing fire-induced ecosystem degradation and designing suitable
   restoration strategies in the post-fire period. Copyright (C) 2017 John

Abstract = {{Wildfire is an essential earth-system process, impacting ecosystem
   processes and the carbon cycle. Forest fires are becoming more frequent
   and severe, yet gaps exist in the modeling of fire on vegetation and
   carbon dynamics. Strategies for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
   from wildfires include increasing tree harvest, largely based on the
   public assumption that fires burn live forests to the ground, despite
   observations indicating that less than 5\% of mature tree biomass is
   actually consumed. This misconception is also reflected though excessive
   combustion of live trees in models. Here, we show that regional
   emissions estimates using widely implemented combustion coefficients are
   59\%-83\% higher than emissions based on field observations. Using
   unique field datasets from before and after wildfires and an improved
   ecosystem model, we provide strong evidence that these large
   overestimates can be reduced by using realistic biomass combustion
   factors and by accurately quantifying biomass in standing dead trees
   that decompose over decades to centuries after fire ({''}snags{''}).
   Most model development focuses on area burned; our results reveal that
   accurately representing combustion is also essential for quantifying
   fire impacts on ecosystems. Using our improvements, we find that western
   US forest fires have emitted 232 +/- 62 Tg CO2 (similar to half of
   alternative estimates) over the last 17 years, which is minor compared
   to 4,400 Tg CO2 from fossil fuels across the region.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which prescribed fires affect forest structure and
   habitats of vertebrate species is an important question for land
   managers tasked with balancing potentially conflicting objectives of
   vegetation and wildlife management. Many insectivorous bats forage for
   insect prey in forested habitats, serving as the primary predators of
   nocturnal forest insects, and are potentially affected by structural
   changes in forests resulting from prescribed fires. We compared
   forest-stand characteristics of temperate oak-hickory forests, as
   measured with airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging,
   LiDAR), with categorical estimates of burn severity from prescribed
   fires as derived from Landsat data and field-based Composite Burn
   Indices, and used acoustic monitoring to quantify activity of
   insectivorous bats in association with varying degrees of burn severity
   (unburned habitat, low severity and medium severity). Forest-stand
   characteristics showed greatest separation between low-severity and
   medium-severity classes, with gap index, i.e. open-air space, increasing
   with degree of burn severity. Greater mid-storey density, over-storey
   density and proportion of vegetation in the understorey occurred in
   unburned habitat. Activity of bats did not differ with burn severity for
   high-frequency (clutter-adapted or closed-space foragers) or
   low-frequency (edge or open-space foragers) bats. Results indicate that
   differing degrees of burn severity from prescribed fires produced
   spatial variation in canopy structure within stands; however, bats
   demonstrated no shifts in activity levels to this variation in canopy
   structure, suggesting prescribed fire during the dormant season, used as
   a management practice targeting desired changes in vegetation, is
   compatible with sustaining foraging habitat of insectivorous bats.}},

Abstract = {{Chaining and prescribed fire treatments have been widely applied
   throughout pinyon-juniper woodlands of the western United States in an
   effort to reduce tree cover and stimulate understory growth. Our
   objective was to quantify effects of treatment on woodland recovery rate
   and structure and the relative dominance of the two major tree species
   in our Great Basin study area, singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla Torr.
   \& Frem.) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma {[}Torr.] Little). We
   resampled plots after a 40-yr interval to evaluate species-specific
   differences in tree survivorship and establishment from posttreatment
   age structures. Tree age data were collected in 2008 within four chained
   sites in eastern Nevada, treated in 1958, 1962, 1968, and 1969 and
   originally sampled in 1971. The same data were collected at five
   prescribed burn sites treated in 1975 and originally sampled in 1976.
   All chained sites had greater juniper survival than pinyon survival
   immediately following treatment. Chained sites with higher tree survival
   also had the greatest amount of new tree establishment. During the
   interval between treatment and the 2008 sampling, approximately four
   more trees per hectare per year established following chaining than
   following fire. Postfire tree establishment only occurred for the
   initial 15 yr and was dominated by juniper. Establishment after chaining
   was dominated by juniper for the first 15 yr but by pinyon for 15-40 yr
   following treatment. Results support an earlier successional role for
   juniper than for pinyon, which is more dependent upon favorable
   microsites and facilitation from nurse shrubs. Repeated chaining at
   short intervals, or prescribed burning at infrequent intervals, will
   likely favor juniper dominance. Chaining at infrequent intervals (>
   20-40 yr) will likely result in regained dominance of pinyon. Chaining
   treatments can be rapidly recolonized by trees and have the potential to
   create or amplify landscape-level shifts in tree species composition.}},

Abstract = {{This research represents one of the first studies in Amazonia to examine
   soil moisture and water-use efficiency (WUE) in secondary forest (SF)
   vegetation regrowing on abandoned pastures subjected to reduced nutrient
   constraints via a nutrient addition experiment. Extensive forested areas
   (about 80\% of deforestation) have been converted to pastures in
   Amazonia, which were later abandoned following soil degradation and
   reduction in grass productivity. Colonization of these areas proceeds
   through species adapted to adverse edaphic conditions, such as low soil
   nutrients. Yet there is little data from such environments showing the
   interaction of soil nutrients and water availability on plant
   physiological processes. The objective of this study was to test whether
   three common SF tree species have positive physiological responses, e.g.
   increased photosynthesis and water-use efficiency, when nutrient
   limitations are relaxed through fertilization. The experiment was
   conducted on an abandoned pasture in central Amazonia with 6-year-old
   secondary vegetation following the application of four treatments:
   control; +phosphorus (P); +phosphorus and lime (P + Ca); and
   +phosphorus, lime and gypsum (P + Ca + G). The control had higher mean
   soil moisture at 140 and 180cm depth at the end of the dry season,
   indicating that the treatment plots responded positively to fertilizer
   additions by taking up additional water. Trees of Vismia japurensis and
   Bellucia grossularloides growing on the fertilized plots had the highest
   net photosynthesis rates (A) (18.7 and 20.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1),
   respectively). The three species utilized different strategies with
   regard to physiological and nutritional response, with V japurensis,
   regardless of treatment, using these limiting resources most efficiently
   to colonize abandoned pastures. Trees growing on the P + Ca but not +P
   alone plots increased A rates, indicating that Ca is an important
   limiting nutrient in post-pasture secondary succession. The addition of
   Ca as ash by burning primary and secondary vegetation could explain the
   rapid growth and dominance of V japurensis in abandoned pasture areas in
   central Amazonia. The efficiency of Vismia to use limiting resources
   could lead to a restructuring of SF and altered rates of stand-level
   productivity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fire frequency is expected to increase due to climate warming in many
   areas, particularly the boreal forests. An increase in fire frequency
   may have important effects on the global carbon cycle by decreasing the
   size of boreal carbon stores. Our objective was to quantify and compare
   the amount of carbon consumed during and the amount of carbon remaining
   following fire in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forests
   burned after long v. short intervals. We hypothesised that stands with a
   shortened fire return interval would have a higher carbon consumption
   than those experiencing a historically typical fire return interval.
   Using field measurements of forest canopy, soil organic horizons and
   adventitious roots, we reconstructed pre-fire stand conditions to
   estimate the biomass lost in each fire and the effects on post-fire
   residual carbon stores. We found evidence of a higher loss of carbon
   following two fire events that recurred after a short interval,
   resulting in a much greater total reduction in carbon relative to
   pre-fire or mature stand conditions. Consequently, carbon storage across
   disturbance intervals was dramatically reduced following short-interval
   burns. Recovery of these stores would require a subsequent lengthening

Volume = {{265}},
Pages = {{37-46}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The pace of deforestation worldwide has necessitated the development of
   strategies that restore forest cover quickly and efficiently. We review
   one potential strategy, applied nucleation, which involves planting
   small patches of trees as focal areas for recovery. Once planted, these
   patches, or nuclei, attract dispersers and facilitate establishment of
   new woody recruits, expanding the forested area over time. Applied
   nucleation is an attractive option in that it mimics natural
   successional processes to aid woody plant recolonization. To date,
   results of experimental tests of applied nucleation are consistent with
   theoretical predictions and indicate that the density and diversity of
   colonists is higher in planted nuclei than in areas where no planting
   takes place (e.g. passive restoration). These studies suggest that the
   applied nucleation strategy has the potential to restore deforested
   habitats into heterogeneous canopies with a diverse community
   composition, while being cheaper than projects that rely on plantation
   designs. We recommend several areas where research would aid in refining
   the methodology. We also call for further comparisons as nuclei age
   beyond the 2-13 years that have been studied, thus far, in order to
   confirm that practical applications continue to match theoretical
   predictions. Finally, we suggest that applied nucleation could be
   effective in the restoration of a variety of habitat types or species
   guilds beyond the ones to which it has been applied thus far. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Biotic resistance and disturbance are fundamental processes influencing
   plant invasion outcomes; however, the role of consumers in regulating
   the establishment and spread of plant invaders and how disturbance
   modifies biotic resistance by consumers is unclear. We document that
   fire in combination with experimental exclusion of rodent consumers
   shifted a native desert shrubland to a low-diversity, invasive annual
   grassland dominated by Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass). In contrast, burned
   plots with rodents present suppressed invasion by cheatgrass and
   developed into a more diverse forb community. Rodents created strong
   biotic resistance to the establishment of aggressive plant invaders
   likely through seed and seedling predation, which had cascading effects
   on plant competition and plant community diversity. Fire mediated its
   positive effects on plant invaders through native plant removal and by
   decreasing the abundance and diversity of the rodent community. The
   experimental disruption of plant and consumer-mediated biotic resistance
   of plant invaders using fire and rodent exclusion treatments provides
   strong evidence that native plants and rodents are important regulators
   of plant invasion dynamics and plant biodiversity in our study system.
   While rodents conferred strong resistance to invasion in our study
   system, fluctuations in rodent populations due to disturbance and
   climatic events may provide windows of opportunity for exotic plant
   species to escape biotic resistance by rodent consumers and initiate
   invasions.}},

   biomass shares ranged from 4-8\% in secondary regrowth and were two to
   four times higher in mature rain forest (17\%, or 78 tons ha(-1)).
   Legume taxonomic composition differed strongly between secondary and
   mature rain forests, and floristic similarity (Jaccard's coefficient) of
   legumes between both forest types was only 34\%. Successional changes in
   legume vegetation shares and taxonomic composition were weak within

   vegetation. Legume functional composition changed along succession with
   high shares of potentially N-2-fixing lianas in young regrowth. We
   conclude that 1) the composition of legume species in the community

   composition along regrowth does not provide an adequate criterion for

Abstract = {{Caribou are an integral component of high-latitude ecosystems and
   represent a major subsistence food source for many northern people. The
   availability and quality of winter habitat is critical to sustain these
   caribou populations. Caribou commonly use older spruce woodlands with
   adequate terrestrial lichen, a preferred winter forage, in the
   understory. Changes in climate and fire regime pose a significant threat
   to the long-term sustainability of this important winter habitat.
   Computer simulations performed with a spatially explicit vegetation
   succession model (ALFRESCO) indicate that changes in the frequency and
   extent of fire in interior Alaska may substantially impact the abundance
   and quality of winter habitat for caribou. We modeled four different
   fire scenarios and tracked the frequency, extent, and spatial
   distribution of the simulated fires and associated changes to vegetation
   composition and distribution. Our results suggest that shorter fire
   frequencies (i.e., less time between recurring fires) on the winter
   range of the Nelchina caribou herd in eastern interior Alaska will
   result in large decreases of available winter habitat, relative to that
   currently available, in both the short and long term. A 30\% shortening
   of the fire frequency resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the area burned
   annually and an associated 41\% decrease in the amount of spruce-lichen
   forest found on the landscape. More importantly, simulations with more
   frequent fires produced a relatively immature forest age structure,
   compared to that which currently exists; with few stands older than 100
   years. This age structure is at the lower limits of stand age classes
   preferred by caribou from the Nelchina herd. Projected changes in fire
   regime due to climate warming and/or additional prescribed burning could
   substantially alter the winter habitat of caribou in interior Alaska and
   lead to changes in winter range use and/or population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Successional dynamics in plant community assembly may result from both
   deterministic and stochastic ecological processes. The relative
   importance of different ecological processes is expected to vary over
   the successional sequence, between different plant functional groups,
   and with the disturbance levels and land-use management regimes of the
   successional systems. We evaluate the relative importance of stochastic
   and deterministic processes in bryophyte and vascular plant community
   assembly after fire in grazed and ungrazed anthropogenic coastal
   heathlands in Northern Europe. A replicated series of post-fire
   successions (n = 12) were initiated under grazed and ungrazed
   conditions, and vegetation data were recorded in permanent plots over 13
   years. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to test for deterministic
   successional patterns in species composition repeated across the
   replicate successional series and analyses of co-occurrence to evaluate
   to what extent species respond synchronously along the successional
   gradient. Change in species co-occurrences over succession indicates
   stochastic successional dynamics at the species level (i.e., species
   equivalence), whereas constancy in co-occurrence indicates deterministic
   dynamics (successional niche differentiation). The RDA shows high and
   deterministic vascular plant community compositional change, especially
   early in succession. Co-occurrence analyses indicate stochastic
   species-level dynamics the first two years, which then give way to more
   deterministic replacements. Grazed and ungrazed successions are similar,
   but the early stage stochasticity is higher in ungrazed areas. Bryophyte
   communities in ungrazed successions resemble vascular plant communities.
   In contrast, bryophytes in grazed successions showed consistently high
   stochasticity and low determinism in both community composition and
   species co-occurrence. In conclusion, stochastic and individualistic
   species responses early in succession give way to more niche-driven
   dynamics in later successional stages. Grazing reduces predictability in
   both successional trends and species-level dynamics, especially in plant
   functional groups that are not well adapted to disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Cause for spatial variation in phenotypic quality of white-tailed deer
   (Odoccileus virginianus) populations is of great interest to wildlife
   managers. Relating phenotypic variation of populations to large-scale
   land-use patterns may provide insight into why populations exhibit
   spatial variation and elucidate how management can influence population
   phenotype. We used an information-theoretic approach to relate average
   antler size of 203 deer populations to composition and structure of the
   habitat occupied by those populations. We used interspersion, edge, and
   diversity indices to represent habitat structure and percentage of area
   in vegetation types to represent habitat composition. Landscape
   composition was a better predictor of deer population antler size than
   was landscape structure. Percentages of the management unit in
   agriculture, pasture, and pine forest were variables commonly found in
   the region-specific set of best models. Model-averaged estimates of
   agriculture and pasture parameters were always positive and estimates of
   pine forest parameters were always negative, which suggests that
   land-use types that promote growth of early successional herbaceous
   plants will positively influence antler size and, most likely, body
   growth and reproduction of white-tailed deer populations. Conversely,
   our findings suggest landscapes dominated by pine forests did not
   provide optimal amounts of quality forages for white-tailed deer. Pine
   forest effects should be mitigated using a combination of increased
   harvest to lower deer density and silvicultural practices like thinning,
   prescribed burning, and selective herbicide applications that stimulate
   growth of high-quality forages beneath the forest canopy to improve deer
   phenotypic quality.}},

Abstract = {{Disruptions to historic disturbance and herbivory regimes have altered
   plant assemblages in forests worldwide. An emerging consensus suggests
   that these disruptions often result in impoverished forest biotas. This
   is particularly true for eastern U.S. deciduous forests where large gaps
   and understory fires were once relatively common and browsers were far
   less abundant. Although much research has focused on how disturbance and
   browsers affect tree diversity, far less attention has been devoted to
   forest understories where the vast majority (>75\%) of the vascular
   species reside. Here we test the hypothesis that the reintroduction of
   disturbances resembling historic disturbance regimes and moderate levels
   of ungulate browsing enhance plant diversity. We explore whether
   once-common disturbances Mid their interaction with the top-down
   influence of browsers can create conditions favorable for the
   maintenance of a rich herbaceous layer in a region recognized as a
   temperate biodiversity hotspot in West Virginia, USA. We tested this
   hypothesis via a factorial experiment whereby we manipulated canopy gaps
   (presence/absence) of a size typically found in old-growth stands,
   low-tensity understory fire (burned/unburned), and deer browsing
   (fenced/unfenced). We tracked the abundance and diversity of more than
   140 herb species for six years.
   Interactions among our treatments were pervasive. The combination of
   canopy gaps and understory fire increased herbaceous layer richness,
   cover, and diversity well beyond either disturbance alone. Furthermore.
   we documented evidence that deer at moderate levels of abundance promote
   herbaceous richness and abundance by preferentially browsing
   fast-growing pioneer species that thrive following co-occurring
   disturbances (i.e., fire and gaps). This finding sharply contrasts with
   the negative impact browsers have when their populations reach levels
   well beyond those that occurred for centuries,. Although speculative,
   our results suggest that interactions among fire. canopy gaps, and
   browsing provided a variable set of habitats and conditions across the
   landscape that was potentially capable of maintaining much of the plant
   diversity found in temperate forests.}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Frequent fire often has a negative impact of tree recruitment and
   growth. Tree growth rates, density and recruitment were compared among
   treatments of annual burning since 1952, triennial burning since 1973
   and no burning (1946 to 1996) or single wildfire (1996 to 2018), in a
   dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest, south-eastern Queensland, Australia.
   Tree diameter (at breast height, DBH) growth rates were greater in the
   annually burnt treatment than in the triennially burn and single
   wildfire treatments over the period from 1974 to 2018, and these
   differences were also apparent pre-wildfire (period from 1974 to 1996).
   In the period from 1996 to 2018, the annually burnt treatment had
   greater DBH growth relative to the single wildfire treatment, but the
   triennial treatment had intermediate growth rates. Competitive
   interactions between trees (assessed using plot basal area) also had a
   negative impact on individual tree growth rates. The impacts of
   different fire regimes at this site on tree crown health were not
   apparent (P > 0.05) and there was only limited evidence that differences
   in growth rates were due to differences in soil nutrients (marginally
   higher topsoil phosphorus in the frequently burnt treatments, P =
   0.075). Greater tree growth rates in the annually burnt treatment may be
   related to the lower density of understorey woody plants in this
   treatment and potentially reduced competition for soil moisture. The
   density of trees (DBH >= 10 cm) in 2018 was surprisingly higher in the
   triennially burnt treatment (381 stems/ha) relative to both the annually
   burnt (192 stems/ha) and single wildfire (234 stems/ha) treatments. This
   was largely due a higher level of recruitment over time and a higher
   density of stems 10-20 cm DBH in triennially burnt plots. Concerns
   regarding the impacts of frequent prescribed fire on tree recruitment
   and growth may be unwarranted in these remarkably resilient dry eucalypt

Abstract = {{We initiated a study of the effects of mycorrhizal fungal community

   Tree seedlings were planted in a severely burned experimental site (1995

   Reserve, in north Quintana Roo, Mexico. Seedlings of Leucaena
   leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia, Caesalpinia violacea, Piscidia
   piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, and Cochlospermum vitifolium were
   germinated in steam-sterilized soil and either remained uninoculated
   (nonmycorrhizal at transplanting) or were inoculated with mycorrhizal
   fungi in soils from early-seral (recently burned) or late-seral (mature
   forest) inoculum. Inoculum from the early-seral soil was largely Glomus
   spp., whereas a diverse community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were
   reintroduced from the mature forest including species of Scutellospora,
   Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis, and Acaulospora. Plants grew better
   when associated with the mature forest inoculum, unlike a previous
   experiment in which plants grew taller with the early-seral inoculum.
   Reasons for the different responses include a less-intense burn
   resulting in more residual organic matter. In addition to mycorrhizal
   responses, plants were severely affected by deer browsing. One tree
   species, C. vitifolium found in the region but not in the reserve, was
   eliminated by a resident fungal facultative pathogen. Several practical
   conclusions for restoration can be made. The common nursery practice of
   soil sterilization may be detrimental because it eliminates beneficial
   mycorrhizal fungi; species not native to the site may not survive
   because they may not be adapted to the local pathogens; and herbivory
   can be severe depending on the landscape context of the restoration.}},

   richness of this plant group in the seed bank was higher in the
   quadrennial treatment at one site and in the long unburnt treatment at
   the other site. Long unburnt treatments had an understorey of rainforest
   species, while biennial burning at one site and quadrennial burning at
   the other site were associated with greater standing grass density
   relative to the unburnt treatment. This difference in vegetation
   composition due to fire regime potentially influences the flammability
   of the standing understorey vegetation. Significant interactions between
   fire regime and site, apparent in the standing and soil-stored
   vegetation, demonstrate the high degree of natural variability in
   vegetation community responses to fire regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris) woodlands and savannas are among the
   most frequently burned ecosystems in the world with. re return intervals
   of 1-10 years. This. re regime has maintained high levels of
   biodiversity in terms of both species richness and endemism. Land use
   changes have reduced the area of this ecosystem by > 95\%, and
   inadequate. re frequencies threaten many of the remnants today. In the
   absence of frequent. re, rapid colonization of hardwoods and shrubs
   occurs, and a broad-leaved midstory develops. This midstory encroachment
   has been the focus of much research and management concern, largely
   based on the assumption that the midstory reduces understory plant
   diversity through direction competition via light interception. The
   general application of this mechanism of degradation is questionable,
   however, because midstory density, leaf area, and hardwood species
   composition vary substantially along a soil moisture gradient from mesic
   to extremely xeric sites. Reanalysis of recently reported data from
   xeric longleaf pine communities suggests that the development of the
   forest floor, a less conspicuous change in forest structure, might cause
   a decline in plant biodiversity when forests remain unburned. We report
   here a test of the interactions among. re, litter accumulation, forest
   floor development, and midstory canopy density on understory plant
   diversity. Structural equation modeling showed that within xeric sites,
   forest floor development was the primary factor explaining decreased
   biodiversity. The only effects of midstory development on biodiversity
   were those mediated through forest floor development. Boundary line
   analysis of functional guilds of understory plants showed sensitivity to
   even minor development of the forest floor in the absence of. re. These
   results challenge the prevailing management paradigm and suggest that
   within xeric longleaf pine communities, the primary focus of managed. re
   regime should be directed toward the restoration of forest floor
   characteristics rather than the introduction of high-intensity. res used
   to regulate midstory structure.}},

   large and statistically significant (P <= 0.05) losses of C, N, P, S,

   significant effects on mineral soils aside from a decrease in total N in
   the surface (All) horizon, an increase in pH in the All horizon, and
   increases in water-extractable SO42- in the All and A12 horizons.
   Burning caused consistent but nonsignificant increases in exchangeable

   effects on exchangeable K+ or Mg2+, or on Bray-, bicarbonate-, or
   water-extractable P concentrations. Before the burn, there were no

Abstract = {{The increasing knowledge in the capabilities of satellite imagery to
   hazard applications is especially useful in emergency situations where
   timing and ability to cover large areas are of the essence. For optical
   imagery, cloud coverage can corrupt an image rendering it unusable for
   intended emergency analyses. This study proposes the use of Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for burn severity analysis for western
   United States sites, as an alternative to its optical based counterpart,
   differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR). Unlike optical sensors, the
   radar sensor is an active sensor that is able to penetrate clouds and
   smoke, an attribute that is crucial in emergency situations where
   immediate burn severity data are needed to assess the vulnerability of
   fire affected areas to post-fire hazards. Using C5 decision tree
   algorithm we developed a SAR-based metric that attempts to classify burn
   severities of fire affected locations in the western USA. We then
   compared the performance of this developed metric to that obtained by
   the existing dNBR metric, to determine if there is any merit to its
   adoption as an alternative for the western USA landscape. The results
   showed the SAR approach to produce higher validation metrics in
   comparison to the dNBR. It had an overall accuracy and kappa of 60\% and
   0.35, respectively, in comparison to the 35\% and 0.1 of the dNBR

Abstract = {{Exotic plant invasions are especially problematic because
   reestablishment of native perennial vegetation is rarely successful. It
   may be more appropriate to treat exotic plant infestations that still
   have some remaining native vegetation. We evaluated this restoration
   strategy by measuring the effects of spring burning, fall burning, fall
   applied imazapic, spring burning with fall applied imazapic, and fall
   burning with fall applied imazapic on the exotic annual grass,
   medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski), and native
   vegetation at six sites in Oregon for 2 years post-treatment. Medusahead
   infestations included in this study had some residual native perennial
   bunchgrasses and forbs. Burning followed by imazapic application
   provided the best control of medusahead and resulted in the greatest
   increases in native perennial vegetation. However, imazapic application
   decreased native annual forb cover the first year post-treatment and
   density the first and second year post-treatment. The spring burn
   followed by imazapic application produced an almost 2-fold increase in
   plant species diversity compared to the control. The fall burn followed
   by imazapic application also increased diversity compared to the
   control. Results of this study indicate that native plants can be
   promoted in medusahead invasions; however, responses vary by plant
   functional group and treatment. Our results compared to previous
   research suggest that restoration of plant communities invaded by exotic
   annual grass may be more successful if efforts focus on areas with some

   with some native vegetation remaining should receive priority for
   restoration efforts over near monocultures of invasive plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an ecological disturbance that alters soil microbiomes and the
   functions they mediate in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil microbial
   diversity in Mediterranean Basin ecosystems shows resilience to fire
   following the restoration of plant-soil feedbacks. We hypothesised that
   microbial functions related to organic matter decomposition and nutrient
   cycling might show similar patterns of recovery. We quantified the rates
   of microbial respiration and enzymatic activities related to C, N and P
   cycling in three 20-year fire chronosequences including 150 transects in
   50 burned and unburned plots (no historical fire registers) in a paired
   experimental design. Microbial functions, except for the hydrolysis of N
   compounds, were sensitive to fire but recovered the levels of unburned
   plots in approximately 20-24 years. The recovery of microbial functions
   responded to abiotic and biotic drivers. Total soil nitrogen
   concentration was overall strong predictor of microbial functions. In
   addition, fungal phylogenetic diversity significantly explained the
   post-fire trajectories of potentially mineralizable C, while bacterial
   diversity was involved in the restoration of organic C and P hydrolysis.
   Our results suggest that the long-term recovery of soil biodiversity in

Journal = {{CONSERVATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In disturbed rain forests, large, living remnant trees may be of
   significant importance for postdisturbance reorganization either
   directly, by producing large quantities of seeds, or indirectly, by
   attracting vertebrate seed dispersers. In addition, remnant trees may
   also be important in providing a favorable microhabitat for seedlings of
   late-successional species. This study focused on the role of large
   remnant trees (> 40 cm dbh) in patterns of regeneration after cyclone
   and fire damage in the Tafua and Falealupo Rain Forest Preserves,
   Savaii, Samoa. At Tafua, 10 large trees at each of two sites (one site
   burned in 1990) were investigated with regard to numbers of species and
   densities of plants from three different size classes at different
   distances from remnant trees. At the burned site, both species richness
   and the densities of plants < 1cm dbh were significantly higher inside
   the canopies of remnant trees than outside of them. At the unburned
   site, no or only marginally significant differences were observed. At
   Falealupo, two burned sites (burned in 1993 and 1998) were investigated
   using seed traps. At both sites, the seed rain from vertebrate
   dispersers was disproportionally higher under the canopies of remnant
   trees than in outside areas. No differences in soil characteristics were
   found when comparing samples taken from inside and outside canopies. Our
   results are congruent with the prediction that large remnant trees
   surviving in severely disturbed rain-forest areas represent biological
   legacies and serve as nuclei for reorganization. Based on this study and
   our previous work, we suggest that three factors represent essential
   components of the spatial resilience of tropical forest ecosystems and
   should be targeted for active management in tropical forests exposed to
   large-scale disturbances, particularly fire: remnant trees, refugia, and
   vertebrate dispersers.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological function of charcoal has been mainly investigated by adding
   charcoal to soil, which is not fully adequate to understand in situ the

   conducted an experimental burning in a Japanese white birch forest with
   dense coverage of dwarf bamboo in the understory with or without removal
   of charcoal. Ammonium-N in the remaining humus layer increased
   immediately after the burning, but decreased to the level of unburnt
   plots within 1 month of the burning. Removal of charcoal had no
   significant effect on the NH4 (+)-N dynamics. Although burning did not
   affect NO3 (-)-N dynamics during the sampling period, charcoal removal
   led to a slight increase in NO3 (-)-N. The available P increased
   immediately after the burning, but then fell at 1 month after burning.
   Charcoal inhibited the available P depletion and prolonged the high
   availability of P. Greater availability of P might be due to the
   adsorption of phosphate in charcoal pores. Exchangeable Ca and Mg
   increased gradually; charcoal appeared to extend the period of higher
   concentration of exchangeable Ca and Mg. Charcoal deriving from fire is
   a key factor in influencing available nutrient in the humus layer of

Abstract = {{Adaptive management methods are best for ensuring management goals are
   met when implementing prescribed fire to areas of fire exclusion. Prior
   to intense logging and subsequent fire suppression efforts of the early
   1900s, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands dominated the
   southeastern United States. As a pyrogenic forest type, natural
   wildfires occur with a 2-15 year fire return interval. Remaining
   longleaf forests are predominantly second-growth, with current
   vegetation structure reflecting decades of fire exclusion resulting from
   continued suppression efforts. Research in longleaf savannas has
   demonstrated that hardwood encroachment, reduced floristic diversity,
   and reduced longleaf yearling establishment occurs in the absence of
   fire. However, few studies have examined the potential role of
   prescribed fire management in moderating longleaf pine regeneration in
   second-growth xeric sandhill assemblages. Over a seven year period of
   fire reintroduction, we examined the effects of prescribed fire on
   longleaf pine demographics and structure in a forest that experienced a
   significant reduction in fire frequency during the 20th century. We
   observed no difference in overstory composition or hardwood density
   between burned and adjacent unburned areas. Understory woody stem
   density (DBH < 2 cm) was dominated by juvenile longleaf plants, which
   likely caused greater variability in light reaching the forest floor in
   unburned vs. burned areas. Significant shifts in demographic structure
   were evident in juvenile longleaf plants that initiated height growth
   following the onset of prescribed fire treatments. Longleaf yearling
   density (<1 year old) averaged 5 plants m(-2) (unburned <1 plant m(-2))
   and was positively correlated with fire frequency. Greater accumulation
   of leaf litter in unburned (10 cm) vs. burned areas (5 cm) likely
   influenced yearling recruitment, as expected given the species' need for
   contact with bare mineral soil for germination. Unlike pine savannas
   where reduction of hardwoods is often the target of management,
   intraspecific interactions (i.e. negative density dependence) likely
   play a greater role in successful longleaf recruitment and population
   demography in this sandhill assemblage. This study further highlights
   the utility of implementing and observing a range of fire applications
   when reintroducing fire to long unburned systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires play a significant role in many different elements of
   Mediterranean forest ecosystems. In recent years, prescribed fires have
   started being used more often as a fuel reduction tool, and also as
   silvicultural treatment to help the regeneration and health improvement
   of stands. Apart from the fact that fire may alter microsite conditions,
   very little is known about the impact of prescribed burning on natural
   regeneration or plant species renewal in Mediterranean pine forests.
   Likewise, knowledge about the influence of seedling predators on
   post-fire regeneration is still scarce. In this study, we aimed to
   compare the effects of seedling predation on recruitment in earlier
   stages after prescribed burnings in three pine stands in Central Spain:
   a pure stand of Pinus nigra; a mixed stand of Pinus halepensis and Pinus
   pinaster and a mixed stand P. nigra with P. pinaster. In situ we
   superficially sowed seeds from two different species. In the sowing
   experiment, we tested two different seed provenances (drier and more
   humid spanish regions) for each species. In all, 60 plots (30 burned, 30
   unburned) per site, with 10 seeding units per plot and more than 20,000
   seeds, were used in the whole study. Seedling predation was evaluated by
   replicating the seeding units inside and outside a wire cage as
   protection for rodents and birds. Our results showed that prescribed
   fires alter initial seedling predation intensity: predation was
   significantly higher in the seedlings grown in the plots affected by
   prescribed fire. The individuals sown before the fire passed showed
   slightly more predation than those sown after fire passage. Provenances
   did not appear as an important predation drive. Understanding the role
   of the predation associated with these treatments can help improve
   Mediterranean pine forest management.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of forest to regenerate after harvesting is a key element
   for sustainability of the ecosystem. For semi-arid tropical savanna
   environments, managing resprouts after tree cutting is ideally suited

   vegetatively. Regeneration in this ecosystem is, however, prone to many
   disturbance factors such as fire and grazing by livestock.
   In this paper, we used a factorial experiment to examine the long-term
   effects of annual early burning and grazing on dominant species'
   resprout biomass dynamics after selective cutting in the Sudanian
   savanna-woodlands of Burkina Faso, West Africa
   Burning decreased shoot mortality of Crossopteryx febrifuga while
   grazing increased that of Detarium microcarpum. Burning, in later
   measurement years, reduced resprouts' size of Acacia macrostachya, C.
   febrifuga and D. microcarpum while an increased basal area was observed
   for Combretum glutinosum. There was no significant evidence of grazing
   hampering growth.
   Moderate livestock grazing could be integrated in the forest management
   prescriptions in Burkina Faso for the sake of multi-purpose uses, while
   more attention should be paid to burning practices to lower fire

Abstract = {{Question: How do interactions between rocky landscape features and fire

   Location: Continental Eastern USA.
   Methods: We measured vegetation, disturbance and site characteristics in
   40 pairs of rocky and non-rocky plots: 20 in recently burned stands, and
   20 in stands with no evidence of recent fire ('unburned' stands).
   Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the main and
   interaction effects of fire and rock cover on plant community
   composition.
   Results: In burned stands, rock cover had a strong influence on
   vegetation. Non-rocky `matrix' forests were dominated by Quercus, and
   had abundant ground cover and advance regeneration of early and
   mid-successional tree species. Burned rocky patches supported greater
   density of fire-sensitive species such as Acer rubrum, Sassafras albidum
   and Nyssa sylvatica and had little advance regeneration or ground cover.
   Quercus had fewer fire scars and catfaces (open, basal wounds) on rocky
   patches, suggesting that rocky features mitigate fire severity. In
   unburned stands, differences between rocky and non-rocky patches were
   less distinct, with both patch types having sparse ground cover, little
   tree regeneration, and high understorey densities of relatively shade
   tolerant A. rubrum, N.sylvatica and Betula lenta.
   Conclusion: Under a sustained fire regime, heterogeneity in rock cover
   created a mosaic where fire-adapted species such as Quercus dominate the
   landscape, but where fire-sensitive species persisted in isolated
   pockets of lower fire severity. Without fire. species and landscape
   richness may decline as early-mid successional species are replaced by
   more shade tolerant competitors.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of change in tree communities following major disturbances are
   determined by a complex set of interactions between local site factors,
   landscape history and structure, regional species pools and species life
   histories. Our analysis focuses on vegetation change following
   abandonment of agricultural fields or pastures, as this is the most
   extensive form of major disturbance in Neotropical forests. We consider
   five tree community attributes: stem density, basal area, species
   density, species richness and species composition. We describe two case
   studies, in northeastern Costa Rica and Chiapas, Mexico, where both
   chronosequence and annual tree dynamics studies are being applied. These
   case studies show that the rates of change in tree communities often
   deviate from chronosequence trends. With respect to tree species
   composition, sites of different ages differ more than a single site
   followed over time through the same age range. Dynamic changes in basal
   area within stands, on the other hand, generally followed chronosequence
   trends. Basal area accumulation was more linked with tree growth rates
   than with net changes in tree density due to recruitment and mortality.
   Stem turnover rates were poor predictors of species turnover rates,
   particularly at longer time-intervals. Effects of the surrounding
   landscape on tree community dynamics within individual plots are poorly
   understood, but are likely to be important determinants of species
   accumulation rates and relative abundance patterns.}},

Title = {{Soil water repellency after wildfires in the Blue Ridge Mountains,
   United States}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Abstract = {{It is not well understood if wildfires induce soil water repellency in
   broadleaf deciduous forests, such as those endemic to the Blue Ridge
   Mountains of the eastern United States. In 2016, widespread wildfires
   provided an opportunity to study soil water repellency in this region.
   We selected sites in four locations with low to moderate burn
   severities, along with unburned controls. We estimated soil water
   repellency using water drop penetration time measurements from the
   surface (i.e. ash or organic) layer to similar to 5 cm within the
   underlying mineral layer. Two months after the fires, water repellency
   was detected in all locations and was greater in more severely burned
   sites. One location had the greatest water repellency in surface ash
   (frequency of occurrence: 68-74\%), whereas the other locations showed
   greatest repellency at the ash-mineral interface (40-96\%). Unburned
   soils rarely showed repellency (0-18\%). Burned soils also exhibited
   water repellency 1 year post fire. The study results suggest that
   combustion of non-resinous foliage within litter layers can cause water
   repellency in deciduous forests, meaning that this condition is not
   exclusive to coniferous and dryland forests. The duration of impact
   depends on fire severity, and may enhance overland flow and sediment
   transport in affected landscapes.}},

Pages = {{233-247}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Question
   How does vegetation develop during the initial period following severe
   wildfire in managed forests?
   Location
   Southwestern Oregon, USA.
   Methods
   In severely burned plantations, dynamics of (1) shrub, herbaceous, and
   cryptogam richness; (2) cover; (3) topographic, overstory, and site
   influences were characterized on two contrasting aspects 2 to 4 years
   following fire. Analysis of variance was used to examine change in
   structural layer richness and cover over time. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling, multi-response permutation procedure, and
   indicator species analysis were used to evaluate changes in community
   composition over time.
   Results
   Vegetation established rapidly following wildfire in burned plantations,
   following an initial floristics model of succession among structural
   layers. Succession within structural layers followed a combination of
   initial and relay floristic models. Succession occurred simultaneously
   within and among structural layers following wildfire, but at different
   rates and with different drivers. Stochastic (fire severity and site
   history) and deterministic (species life history traits, topography, and
   pre-disturbance plant community) factors determined starting points of
   succession. Multiple successional trajectories were evident in early
   succession.
   Conclusions
   Mixed conifer forests are resilient to interacting effects of natural
   and human-caused disturbances. Predicting the development of vegetation
   communities following disturbances requires an understanding of the
   various successional components, such as succession among and within
   structural layers, and the fire regime. Succession among and within
   structural layers can follow different successional models and
   trajectories, occurs at different rates, and is affected by multiple
   interacting factors.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Fire suppression has made many seasonally dry conifer forests more
   susceptible to high-severity wildfires, which cause large changes in
   forest structure and function. In response, management agencies are
   applying fuel reduction treatments to millions of acres of forest, with
   the goal of moderating fire behavior by reducing tree density and
   understory fuel loads. However, despite their wide application, we still
   lack basic information about the extent to which these treatments
   contribute to forest restoration by increasing forest resilience to
   recurring wildfire events. To address this question, we established 664
   plots across 12 different sites in California, USA, where wildfire
   burned through fuel treatments, and measured a suite of forest
   characteristics relating to overstory structure, understory cover, and
   woody plant regeneration. We tested a ``wildfire-contingency{''}
   hypothesis that there should be strong interactions between treatment
   and fire, specifically that the direction and magnitude of fuel
   treatment effects on forest characteristics will depend on subsequent
   disturbance. This interaction hypothesis had strong support, driven
   largely by effects on trees: without wildfire, live-tree cover was lower
   in treated stands than in untreated stands, but after wildfire, it was
   higher in treated stands than in untreated stands. Treated stands had
   higher soil moisture and more shrub seedlings than untreated stands
   without wildfire but had greater soil moisture and fewer shrub seedlings
   than untreated stands after wildfire. Conversely, litter depth, litter
   cover, and tree seedling abundance were lower in treated stands than in
   untreated stands without wildfire but higher in treated stands than in
   untreated stands after wildfire. Ordination revealed that the magnitude
   of ecological change attributable to wildfire is lower in treated stands
   than in untreated stands. We conclude that properly implemented
   treatments can promote resilience to both first-entry and subsequent
   wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{Wildland fires are the main natural disturbance shaping forest structure
   and composition in eastern boreal Canada. On average, more than 700 000
   ha of forest burns annually and causes as much as CAD 2.9 million worth
   of damage. Although we know that occurrence of fires depends upon the
   coincidence of favourable conditions for fire ignition, propagation, and
   fuel availability, the interplay between these three drivers in shaping
   spatiotemporal patterns of fires in eastern Canada remains to be
   evaluated. The goal of this study was to reconstruct the spatiotemporal
   patterns of fire activity during the last century in eastern Canada's
   boreal forest as a function of changes in lightning ignition, climate,
   and vegetation. We addressed this objective using the dynamic global
   vegetation model LPJ-LMfire, which we parametrized for four plant
   functional types (PFTs) that correspond to the prevalent tree genera in
   eastern boreal Canada (Picea, Abies, Pinus, Populus). LPJ-LMfire was run
   with a monthly time step from 1901 to 2012 on a 10 km(2) resolution grid
   covering the boreal forest from Manitoba to Newfoundland. Outputs of
   LPJ-LMfire were analyzed in terms of fire frequency, net primary
   productivity (NPP), and aboveground biomass. The predictive skills of
   LPJ-LMfire were examined by comparing our simulations of annual burn
   rates and biomass with independent data sets. The simulation adequately
   reproduced the latitudinal gradient in fire frequency in Manitoba and
   the longitudinal gradient from Manitoba towards southern Ontario, as
   well as the temporal patterns present in independent fire histories.
   However, the simulation led to the underestimation and overestimation of
   fire frequency at both the northern and southern limits of the boreal
   forest in Quebec. The general pattern of simulated total tree biomass
   also agreed well with observations, with the notable exception of
   overestimated biomass at the northern treeline, mainly for PFT Picea. In
   these northern areas, the predictive ability of LPJ-LMfire is likely
   being affected by the low density of weather stations, which leads to
   underestimation of the strength of fireweather interactions and,
   therefore, vegetation consumption during extreme fire years. Agreement
   between the spatiotemporal patterns of fire frequency and the observed
   data across a vast portion of the study area confirmed that fire therein
   is strongly ignition limited. A drier climate coupled with an increase
   in lightning frequency during the second half of the 20th century
   notably led to an increase in fire activity. Finally, our simulations
   highlighted the importance of both climate and fire in vegetation:
   despite an overarching CO2-induced enhancement of NPP in LPJ-LMfire,
   forest biomass was relatively stable because of the compensatory effects
   of increasing fire activity.}},

   communities, resulting in the mortality of larger trees and increases in
   the abundance of smaller (<5cm diameter at breast height (DBH)) stems.
   Burning twice decreased stem counts for mountain laurel (Kalmia

   positively to burning twice in the thermic oak community. Table Mountain
   pine stem counts increased in acid cove and thermic oak communities

Abstract = {{Living trees (green trees) are intentionally retained on logged sites
   for many purposes such as wildlife conservation, future wood potential

   objectives. In a retrospective case-control study, we identified factors
   significantly associated with the collapse of living trees retained on
   logged and slash-burnt sites in south-eastern Australia within 8 years
   of harvesting. Trees with incomplete crowns or trees with at least one
   visible cavity were, on average, at three times greater risk of collapse
   relative to trees with complete crowns or no visible cavities,
   respectively. Trees with fire-scarring, trees retained greater than 50 m
   from intact forest or trees retained in isolation were, on average,
   around twice the risk of collapse relative to trees without

   retained among other trees, respectively. When considered jointly, the
   significant factors in a model predicting the collapse of retained trees
   - tree height, tree diameter, crown form - were all associated with the
   health of trees. Choosing the healthiest trees possible for fulfilling
   their function, protecting trees from damage (e.g. fire) and retaining
   trees near, or among, other trees are likely to reduce the risk of
   collapse among retained trees and thus contribute to the effectiveness
   of green-tree retention in logged eucalypt forests. (c) 2007 Elsevier

   trees. Expanding leaves typically showed net losses of CO2 to the
   atmosphere in both burned and unburned trees, even under saturating
   irradiance. Fire caused stem CO2 efflux to decline in overstory trees,
   when measured 8 weeks post-fire. This decline was thought to have
   resulted from reduced availability of C substrate for respiration, due
   to reduced canopy photosynthesis caused by leaf scorching, and to
   priority allocation of fixed C towards reconstruction of a new canopy.
   At the ecosystem scale, we estimated the annual above-ground
   woody-tissue CO2 efflux to be 275 g C m(-2) ground area year(-1) in a
   non-fire year, or approximately 13\% of the annual gross primary
   production.
   We contrasted the canopy physiology of two co-dominant overstory tree
   species, one of which has a smooth bark on its branches capable of
   photosynthetic re-fixation (Eucalyptus miniata), and the other of which
   has a thick, rough bark incapable of re-fixation (Eucalyptus
   tetrodonta). Eucalyptus miniata supported a larger branch sapwood
   cross-sectional area in the crown per unit subtending leaf area, and had
   higher leaf stomatal conductance and photosynthesis than E. tetrodonta.
   Re-fixation by photosynthetic bark reduces the C cost of delivering
   water to evaporative sites in leaves, because it reduces the net C cost
   of constructing and maintaining sapwood. We suggest that re-fixation
   allowed leaves of E. miniata to photosynthesize at higher rates than
   those of E. tetrodonta, while the two invested similar amounts of C in
   the maintenance of branch sapwood.}},

Abstract = {{Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is declining across the western
   United States. Aspen habitats are among the most diverse plant
   communities in this region and loss of these habitats can result in
   shifts in biodiversity, productivity, and hydrology across a range of
   spatial scales. Western aspen occurs on the majority of sites seral to
   conifer species, and long-term maintenance of these aspen woodlands
   requires periodic fire. Over the past century, fire intervals, extents,
   and intensities have been insufficient to regenerate aspen stands at
   historic rates; however the effects of various fire regimes and
   management scenarios on aspen vegetation dynamics at broad spatial and
   temporal scales are unexplored. Here we use field data, remotely sensed
   data, and fire atlas information to develop a spatially explicit
   landscape simulation model to assess the effects of current and historic
   wildfire regimes and prescribed burning programs on landscape vegetation
   composition across two mountain ranges in the Owyhee Plateau, Idaho.
   Model outputs depict the future structural makeup and species
   composition of the landscape at selected time steps under simulated
   management scenarios. We found that under current fire regimes and in
   the absence of management activities, loss of seral aspen stands will
   continue to occur over the next two centuries. However, a return to
   historic fire regimes (burning 12-14\% of the modeled landscape per
   decade) would maintain the majority of aspen stands in early and mid
   seral woodland stages and minimizes the loss of aspen. A fire rotation
   of 70-80 years was estimated for the historic fire regime while the
   current fire regime resulted in a fire rotation of 340-450 years,
   underscoring the fact that fire is currently lacking in the system,
   Implementation of prescribed burning programs, treating aspen and young
   conifer woodlands according to historic fire occurrence probabilities,
   are predicted to prevent conifer dominance and loss of aspen stands. (C)

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe effect of forest fire on soil is complex and relatively
   less understood than its above ground effect. Understanding the effect
   of fire on forest soils can allow improving management of valuable
   forest ecosystems as adequate and proper information is very important
   for efficient management. We have studied the recovery of soil
   properties after fire, using a chronosequence approach (two, five and
   fifteen years after fire and control). Soil samples were collected from
   each plot of four fire patches (B0, B2, B5 \& B15) from three different
   depths viz. 0-10 (Top), 10-20 (Middle), and 20-30cm (Bottom).ResultsSoil
   organic carbon was lower than unburned plots after the fire and could
   not recover to the level of unburned plot (B0) even in 15years. Total N,
   available P, and extractable K were lower 2-years and 5-years after the
   fire but are higher than unburned plot after 15-years. Available
   nitrogen (NO3- and NH4+) remain unchanged or higher than B0 in burned
   patches. Soil pH, Bulk Density, Water Holding Capacity, and Electrical
   Conductivity was lower initially after the fire. Forest fires have
   affected soil properties considerably. The response of soil properties
   varied with years after fire and soil depth.ConclusionForest fires occur
   very frequently in the study area. Significant quantities of carbon and
   total nitrogen are lost to the atmosphere by burning of litter, duff,
   and soil OM. Because nitrogen is one of the most important soil
   nutrients, the recapture of N lost by volatilization during a fire must
   receive special attention. Long-term studies are required to better
   understand the recovery of soil nitrogen.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is frequently used as a land management tool for cattle ranching
   and annual crops in the Amazon. However, these maintenance fires often
   escape into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for
   forest biodiversity. We examined the effect of experimental fires on
   leaf-litter arthropod abundance in a seasonally-dry forest in the
   Brazilian Amazon. The study plots (50 ha each) included a thrice-burned
   forest and an unburned control forest. Pitfall-trap samples were
   collected at 160 randomly selected points in both plots, with sampling
   stratified across four intra-annual replicates across the dry and wet
   seasons, corresponding to 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after the most recent
   fire. Arthropods were identified to the level of order (separating
   Formicidae). In order to better understand the processes that determine
   arthropod abundance in thrice-burned forests, we measured canopy
   openness, understory density and litter depth. All arthropod taxa were
   significantly affected by fire and season. In addition, the interactions
   between burn treatment and season were highly significant for all taxa
   but Isoptera. The burned plot was characterized by a more open canopy,
   lower understory density and shallower litter depth. Hierarchical
   partitioning revealed that canopy openness was the most important factor
   explaining arthropod order abundances in the thrice-burned plot, whereas
   all three environmental variables were significant in the unburned
   control plot. These results reveal the marked impact of recurrent
   wildfires and seasonality on litter arthropods in this transitional
   forest, and demonstrate the overwhelming importance of canopy-openness
   in driving post-fire arthropod abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Moorlands provide several key ecosystem services, as well as supporting
   shooting of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica Latham). Prescribed
   burning of heather is an integral aspect of grouse-moor management but
   is sometimes presented as ecologically damaging. However, a long-term
   burning experiment at Moor House National Nature Reserve, North
   Pennines, northern England, showed that more frequent burning actually
   increased the cover of peat-building species such as Sphagnum mosses and
   cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.). Here we compare those findings
   with data from another deep-peat site in the North Pennines, but one
   that is actively managed as a grouse moor. We describe post-fire
   vegetation change using aerial images to construct a time-series of
   burns. Comparable with the Moor House study, we found highest levels of
   Sphagnum and Eriophorum cover on fires last burned within 3-10 years,
   whereas heather (Calluna vulgaris L.) cover, that of other mosses, and
   overall vegetation height all increased in a linear manner over time
   since burning. These results from an actively managed grouse moor
   subject to prescribed burning demonstrate that the cover and species
   richness of Sphagnum, a key peat-forming group, correlated with reduced
   dominance of tall heather, can benefit from a post-burn period of up to
   10 years.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires can have significant impacts on rangeland productivity and

   In August 2011, such wildfires swept through the North West province of

   There is little information available on how the regional semi-arid

   regeneration capacities of burned rangelands, the recovery of grass
   phytomass, composition and diversity as well as the frequency

   sites were compared in two regional grasslands and one savanna type
   receiving between 480 and 700 mm rainfall y(-1). Fire significantly
   reduced phytomass production, and lowered the grazing capacity and
   potential grazing days across vegetation types. In general, grass
   diversity, composition and relative frequencies remained unaffected
   documenting an overall good regeneration potential of the grass sward.
   An increased proportion of bare patches and decrease of litter indicated

   abandoned agricultural lands at local and landscape scales in Central
   European Russia}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Abandonment of agricultural land is often happening all
   over the world and widespread in Russia. Such lands are subject to
   successional changes in vegetation and it seems necessary to provide
   effective methods for a sustainable ecosystem management of those lands.
   However, factors which determine successional processes, especially
   fires, have not been studied in detail. The aim of this article is to
   reveal how spring grass fires affect the abandoned arable lands in the
   study area at the landscape and local scales.
   Methods: A region of 265.5 km(2) located in the south of Moscow was
   studied. At the landscape scale, we analyzed the spatial characteristics
   of the area in relation with a 30-year history of spring fire events
   extracted from the Landsat archive, and climatic data. Logistic
   regression was used. At the local scale, we sampled soil and vegetation
   at two sites and in three biotopes at each site: mature forest and two
   neighboring biotopes affected and unaffected by fire. Plant species
   diversity, soil quality, and relationship between soil and vegetation
   were assessed by ANOVA, v test, NMDS, and dbRDA.
   Results: Abandoned lands covered 39\% of the study area and not less
   than 72\% of these were affected by grass fires, happening mainly
   between 1998 and 2014. Man causes the ignition of the field layer
   accidentally, but the area over which the fire spreads is determined by
   climatic factors and the presence of flammable material (dry grass and
   litter) for burning. High March temperatures and low precipitation
   values in April increase the inflammability of dry grasses which are
   abundant on the former fields. As a result, burnt areas are steadily
   expanding in abandoned lands where trees are scarce. On abandoned lands
   that were either affected or unaffected by fires, two different plant
   communities developed, respectively: grassy vegetation mainly dominated
   by Calamagrostis epigeios and young forest of pioneer trees with high
   crown coverage. Practically all soil variables were statistically
   different in three biotopes at the research sites. Plant species
   composition was best explained by six soil variables: P2O5, C/N, pH, K,
   SOC, and N values.
   Conclusions: We showed the key role of grass fires in the formation of
   differences in soil and vegetation during the successional recovery of
   abandoned lands at the local and landscape scales.}},

Abstract = {{1 The effects of wildfire ash on ectomycorrhizal (EM) associations were
   investigated by sampling bishop pine (Pinus muricata, D. Don) seedlings
   from control and ash-removed plots 1.5 years after a severe lire in a
   northern Californian P. muricata forest. The below-ground community
   composition of EM at the site was characterized using molecular
   techniques (PCR-RFLP and nucleotide sequencing).
   2 A total of 30 fungal taxa were observed, many of which differed in
   their distribution between treatment and control seedlings. However,
   most of the taxa that were distinctive to either treatment or control
   seedlings occurred only once across the site, precluding statistical
   detection of potential ash effects on EM community composition. There
   were no significant effects of ash removal on plot-level mycorrhizal
   community richness or diversity, and there were no distinct
   treatment-related clusters in a principal components analysis.
   3 Analysis of the combined data indicated that numbers of fungal taxa
   per seedling, numbers of successive root depth increments colonized by
   the same taxon, and distances to neighbouring seedlings colonized by the
   same taxon, were randomly distributed across the site for the majority
   of mycorrhizal fungi. These distributional patterns suggest that the
   post-fire mycorrhizal community structure on P. muricata arose primarily
   from successful colonization by randomly distributed point-source fungal
   inocula within the upper mineral soil layer of the forest floor.
   4 By comparison with pre-fire studies from similar P. muricata sites
   nearby, our data indicate that severe wildfire disturbance resulted in
   marked changes in mycorrhizal community composition, and a sharp
   increase in the relative biomass of ascomycetous fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Cross Timbers forests of south-central North America contain large
   expanses of relatively undisturbed old-growth forest where gap-phase
   regeneration is the main mode of canopy replacement. These forests are
   threatened by fire suppression, overgrazing, invasive species, global
   climate change, and urban development. To characterize dynamics of stand
   development and learn whether canopy trees lost in tree-fall gaps were
   being replaced by trees of the same species, we conducted a study of
   tree-fall gaps and their regeneration in three widely separated Oklahoma
   Cross Timbers forests. Eleven species were found in the forest canopy
   and three species dominated: post oak (Quercus stellata) (76\%),
   blackjack oak (Q. marilandica) (7\%), and black hickory (Carya texana)
   (10\%). Although gaps were small (13-30 m(2)) resulting from the death
   of one to two trees, regeneration did not appear to depend on gap size.
   There was abundant regeneration even in the understory of the closed
   canopy; most likely much of it was sprouts of dominant species
   stimulated by burning. Regeneration was very slow, apparently due to
   drought, which may have been so limiting as to reduce the benefit of
   gaps. There was no evidence that canopy species composition was on track
   to change, as the most common canopy tree species whose deaths resulted
   in a gap, were also the most common tree species regeneration to fill
   the canopy gap.}},

Abstract = {{Few assessments of the effects of fire and grazing on the herbaceous
   components of savannas have been reported for Africa. In the Kruger
   National Park, South Africa, range condition was monitored at three
   savanna sites spanning a rainfall gradient of 450 to 700 mm and subject
   to grazing by wildlife. The sites were burnt at 1-, 2- and 3-year
   intervals, in different seasons and included a control treatment
   excluding fire for >40 years. Initial surveys of the herbaceous
   vegetation were conducted between 1954 and 1957 and repeated between
   1998 and 2001. Grass species were categorised as either decreaser or
   increaser species, which decline or increase with over- or
   under-utilisation, respectively, and their potential to provide forage
   and fuel for fires indicative of range condition were derived. Range
   condition improved with regular burning in the moist sites, but
   deteriorated in the arid sites over all seasons and frequencies of
   burning. It is concluded that the current homogenous approach to burning
   across the Park needs to be adapted by reducing the frequency of fires
   at more arid sites and can be achieved by burning according to the
   proportions of decreaser and increaser species reflecting the ecological
   status of the herbaceous vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Remnant trees within the non-forest matrix are common structures of
   forest landscapes which have high conservation value due to their
   supposed roles as biological legacies and stepping stones in fragmented
   forest scenarios. Fleshy-fruited remnant trees are dispersal foci for
   many forest plants, as seeds accumulate under their canopies after
   visitation by forest frugivores. Despite this recognized effect, little
   is known about the relative role of remnant trees in maintaining their
   seed dispersal function after forest fragmentation. In this work,
   conducted in the Cantabrian Range (Northern Spain), seed deposition by
   frugivorous birds and post-dispersal seed predation by rodents were
   compared beneath the canopies of hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) trees
   scattered in the non-forested matrix, to those embedded in forest
   patches. We studied two years which had strong differences in
   community-wide fruit abundance (high in 2004, and low in 2005). Hawthorn
   and holly (flex aquifolium) seeds dominated the seed rain. The density
   of dispersed seeds differed between years and tree type, with higher
   values under patch trees relative to remnant ones. However, the effect
   of tree type depended on both the year and the seed species, as larger
   differences were found in the year of high fruit availability, and with
   holly seeds. Higher levels of post-dispersal seed predation on holly
   seeds also contributed to offset the differences between tree types. Our
   results suggest that remnant trees, by functioning as dispersal foci,
   facilitate the dispersal of the two most abundant plant species for
   forest succession through the matrix. More importantly, we demonstrated
   that in years of low fruit availability in which forest frugivores are
   forced to exploit scattered fruit resources, the role of remnant trees
   may even be equivalent to that played by forest trees. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Type conversions of vegetation are often triggered by changes in one or
   more limiting environmental factors. Such changes are particularly
   evident along montane forest-meadow ecotones, where historical changes
   in fire, grazing and climate have occurred. In this paper, we
   reconstruct spatial and temporal variation in climate, livestock grazing
   and fire for 11 meadow inclusions in the pine-dominated forest of
   northeastern California, USA. We then compare this environmental
   variation to temporal patterns of tree invasion by dating the
   establishment of 1420 trees, saplings and seedlings. Invasive trees
   included ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.), Jeffrey pine (Pinus
   jeffreyi Grev and Balf.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murrayana
   Loudon (Grev and Balf.)) and western juniper (Juniper occidentalis
   Hook.). Before the arrival of Euro-Americans in 1849, fires burned with
   a median interval of 11 years based on 1-3 ha composite records from
   multiple trees, and 14 years using records from individual trees. There
   was substantial variation in the date of the last recorded fire within
   and among meadows, but fire was rare after 1905. The onset of tree
   establishment varied among meadows, but followed the reduction and
   removal of fire. Livestock grazing also varied among meadows, and the
   highest establishment rates occurred when grazing was moderate. Mean
   tree establishment was 22.9 trees/ha/decade during the late 19th century
   when grazing was unregulated, 62.6 trees/ha/decade when sheep were
   present, but regulated, and 40.7 trees/hectare/decade after sheep were
   replaced with cattle. Ponderosa. and Jeffrey pine established during a
   range of temperature and precipitation conditions, but establishment was
   greater when summer precipitation was below normal, annual temperatures
   were normal and springs were cool. Although changes in disturbance and
   climate were associated with tree establishment, the persistence of
   trees at the meadow edge is best explained by continued fire exclusion.
   With the long-term absence of fire the local effects of different
   disturbance histories are being lost. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Climate projections show Australia becoming significantly warmer during
   the 21st century, while precipitation decreases over much of the

   Australia. Overall, the projected increase in fire by the end of the
   21st century is small (0.7-1.3\% of land area, depending on the climate
   scenario). The direct effects of increasing CO2 on vegetation
   productivity and water-use efficiency influence simulated fire regimes:
   CO2 effects tend to increase burnt area in arid regions, but increase
   vegetation density and reduce burnt area in forested regions. Increases
   in burnt area promote a shift to more fire-adapted trees in wooded areas
   and their encroachment into grasslands, with an overall increase in
   forested area of 3.9-11.9\% of land area by the end of the century. The
   decrease in burnt area in northern Australia leads to an increase in

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The potential impact that climate change may
   have on fire regime in ecosystems that are not fire-dependent emerges
   from fires that are nowadays spreading over higher altitudes and
   northern latitudes. The effects of fire occurrence in high elevation
   forests of Greece became apparent during the last few years when a
   number of large forest fires burned a significant number of high
   altitude fir ecosystems. This paper describes a study that investigated
   perceptions of wildfire risk to fir ecosystems of Greece in the context
   of climate change among a sample of Greek forestry experts by conducting
   personal interviews.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 63 forest experts answered the
   developed survey from 43 different forest management units covering all
   forestry agencies which manage fir forests in the country. The perceived
   fire risk and management to fir forest ecosystems was assessed by means
   of a subset of scales previously identified as relevant to climate
   change and to all fire management aspects, such as fire prevention, fire
   suppression and post fire treatments.
   Results: Increased fire risk was rated as a quite important issue in fir
   forests during the last few years, while the adapting options to climate
   change are not implemented mainly due to budget and personnel
   constrains. According to forest experts, fire prevention in fir forests
   under climate change should be focused on public awareness and fuel
   management. Nevertheless, the survey results indicate that there is also
   a need for specific fire prevention measures such as the type of logging
   activities and other technical measures. The result of this survey
   highlighted the need for the establishment of a new firefighting
   organization and for the better coordination of all involved parties
   during fire suppression.
   Conclusions: The findings of the current study can be critically
   important in determining how forest fire management considerations are
   incorporated into forest management plans and policies under climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Background The availability of preferred habitats determines the spatial
   and temporal distribution of herbivores in savanna ecosystems.
   Understanding habitat preference of a targeted wildlife species is
   crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Habitat
   preference of large grazers in connection to grass height and post-fire
   effect has been debated for the last century. Here, we examined the
   effects of season, grass height and burning on the habitat preference on
   Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) in Maze National
   Park. Data for seasonal habitat selection were collected using both
   direct observation along established transect lines and pellet counting
   using permanently established plots. Every month, we measured grass
   height commonly preferred by Swayne's hartebeest in grassland habitat.
   Starting from the first week of burning, we recorded the abundance of
   Swayne's hartebeest in both burned and unburned grassland patches.
   Results From detected pellets, 94.3\% were recorded in the grassland
   habitat indicating that other habitat types are less used despite their
   extensive cover > 50\% of the Park. During wet and early dry seasons,
   Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat. We found
   that 85.2\% (n = 1079) and 85.3\% (n = 593) of individuals observed in
   areas with a grass height below 30 cm during wet and early-dry seasons,
   respectively; while 70.9\% (n = 2288) preferred grass height below 30 cm
   during the dry season. The density of Swayne's hartebeest in burned
   grassland area was higher than unburned grassland areas up to 150 days
   since burning. However, in unburned grassland areas, the density was
   initially low but showed increasing trend for consecutive days, reaching
   similar density with burned areas after 150 days since burning.
   Conclusion Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat,
   particularly during wet and early-dry seasons, shortest available grass
   height in all seasons and were attracted to burned grassland areas. Our
   results suggested that fire played an important role in maintaining
   habitat quality in grassland, and that management should continue using
   controlled burning as a tool for the conservation of Swayne's
   hartebeest. However, we remain cautious of our findings given the
   paucity of information regarding other confounding factors and the
   absence of long-term data on fire disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of native and alien plant diversity in response to disturbance
   were examined along an elevational gradient in blue oak savanna,
   chaparral, and coniferous forests. Total species richness, alien species
   richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to
   1000 m(2). We found no support for the hypothesis that community
   diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2) point scale, where we
   would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous
   flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover
   increased with increasing native species richness in all communities.
   This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native
   competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives
   and aliens.
   Blue-oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and
   consistently had more alien than native species at the 1-m(2) scale. All
   of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have
   displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have
   greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich
   regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these
   grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites,
   livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover
   only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than
   a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion.
   In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years
   after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and
   alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these
   ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a
   consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive
   presence. Blue oak savannas are an important propagule source for alien
   species because they maintain permanent populations of all alien species
   encountered in postfire chaparral, and because the vegetation mosaic in
   this region places them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which
   alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed at which the
   shrublands return to their former closed-canopy condition determine
   alien invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters the balance
   in favor of alien invasion.
   In the higher-elevation coniferous forests, species diversity was a
   function of fire severity and time since fire. High-intensity fires
   create gaps that decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels and
   nutrients for an ephemeral successional flora. Few species have
   persistent seed banks, so the time since fire is an important
   determinant of colonization success. There was a highly significant
   interaction between fire severity and time since fire for understory
   cover, species richness, and alien richness and cover. Understory was
   sparse in the first year after fire, particularly in low-severity burns,
   and increased substantially several years after fire, particularly on
   high-severity burns. Both fire severity and time since fire affected
   alien species richness and dominance. Coniferous forests had about
   one-third as many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and fewer
   than half of the species were shared between these communities. Unburned
   coniferous forests were largely free of alien species, whereas some
   burned sites had a significant alien presence, which presents a
   challenge for fire restoration of these forests.}},

Abstract = {{Future changes in climate are widely anticipated to increase fire
   frequency, particularly in boreal forests where extreme warming is
   expected to occur. Feedbacks between vegetation and fire may modify the
   direct effects of warming on fire activity and shape ecological
   responses to changing fire frequency. We investigate these interactions
   using extensive field data from the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan,
   Canada, a region where >40\% of the forest has burned in the past 30
   years. We use geospatial and field data to assess the resistance and
   resilience of eight common vegetation states to frequent fire by
   quantifying the occurrence of short-interval fires and their effect on
   recovery to a similar vegetation state. These empirical relationships
   are combined with data from published literature to parameterize a
   spatially explicit, state-and-transition simulation model of fire and
   forest succession. We use this model to ask if and how: (a) feedbacks
   between vegetation and wildfire may modify fire activity on the
   landscape, and (b) more frequent fire may affect landscape forest
   composition and age structure. Both field and GIS data suggest the
   probability of fire is low in the initial decades after fire, supporting
   the hypothesis that fuel accumulation may exert a negative feedback on
   fire frequency. Field observations of pre- and postfire composition
   indicate that switches in forest state are more likely in conifer stands
   that burn at a young age, supporting the hypothesis that resilience is
   lower in immature stands. Stands dominated by deciduous trees or jack
   pine were generally resilient to fire, while mixed conifer and
   well-drained spruce forests were less resilient. However, simulation
   modeling suggests increased fire activity may result in large changes in
   forest age structure and composition, despite the feedbacks between
   vegetation-fire likely to occur with increased fire activity.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed (or ``planned{''}) burning is used by land managers to reduce
   fuel-loads in order to mitigate the spread of wildfire, thereby
   protecting life and property, and to promote environmental heterogeneity
   to enhance biodiversity. Globally, many fire management agencies focus
   on increasing extent and frequency of prescribed burning. There is a
   need to assess how high levels of prescribed burning may affect the
   long-term, landscape level persistence of ecological communities. We
   forward projected management scenarios over 21 years to explore how the
   operationally realistic implementation of four different prescribed burn
   targets, covering 5, 3, 1.5 and 0\% of a large reserve per annum (p.a.)
   might affect provision and removal of fire-mediated habitat of 11 rare
   and threatened bird species. Sustained implementation of high targets (5
   and 3\% p.a.) homogenised the landscape toward young vegetation,
   substantially reducing highly suitable habitat for species requiring
   intermediate (20-60 years post-fire) and older (60 + years) age classes.
   In contrast, no prescribed burning generated insufficient habitat for
   species with early (< 20 years) and intermediate seral requirements.
   Strategies reliant upon persistently high levels of prescribed burning
   are likely to have negative effects on a number of threatened species
   already considered vulnerable due to their low populations and
   restricted ranges. In contrast, management processes that allow for
   periodic evaluation and flexibility in how strategies are implemented
   would better enable practitioners to tailor fire management to
   individual ecosystems. Carefully targeting key areas for wildfire
   prevention, and promoting some successional changes through application
   of fire in other areas, will help to maintain and improve suitable
   habitat for species of conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Variation in the distribution and abundance of woody plants

   Aims: We tested whether lowland tropical tree lineages that colonise
   secondary forests are more late-diverging than clades from old-growth
   forests, and whether tree phylogenetic beta diversity from old-growth to
   secondary forests is higher in burned than non-burned secondary forests.
   Methods: We sampled tree communities in old-growth forests and in
   secondary forests with distinct disturbance histories (burned and
   unburned). We calculated mean family age in each plot, and tested for
   differences among forest types using ANOVA. A phylogenetic
   fuzzy-weighting procedure was employed to generate a matrix describing
   the abundance of tree clades per plot, which was then analysed using a
   principal coordinate analysis.
   Results: Most clades found in old-growth forests were underrepresented
   in secondary forests, which have been heavily colonised by a single
   species from a young lineage that is not found in old-growth forests.
   Phylogenetic beta diversity was higher between unburned secondary

Abstract = {{Forest fires cause immediate and lasting environmental impacts in soil
   organic matter (SOM) by modifying existing chemical structures, forming
   new ones, or adding/removing materials such as fresh or charred biomass.
   In this paper, the information provided by analytical pyrolysis
   (Py-GC/MS) of whole soil samples and two particle-size fractions (coarse
   and fine) is analysed in a sandy soil from, a typical Mediterranean oak
   forest close to Donana National Park (Southwest Spain) that was affected
   by a severe wildfire. The pyrograms from unburnt whole soil samples show
   a prevalence of compounds derived from polysaccharides, proteins and
   lignin, whereas in pyrograms from burnt soils lignin markers prevail
   followed by proteins, alkylaromatic and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons. In fact, it seems clear that fire preferentially removes
   thermolabile biogenic materials with a concomitant selective
   preservation of lignin. Concerning particle size fractions, SOM in the
   unburnt coarse fraction had a major impact on vegetation, whereas the
   fine fraction consisted of comparatively humified SOM with lignin
   degradation and microbial-derived compounds. The pyrolysis products from
   the burnt soil coarse fraction revealed post-fire litter inputs from
   stressed vegetation, whereas the fine fraction shares chemical
   characteristics with those from the unburnt soil, with additional signs
   of fire alteration (less labile carbohydrate structures and higher
   relative abundance of PAHs). Alkane changes observed in the carbon
   preference index indicate that fire affected SOM mostly in the fine
   fraction, whereas the short/long chain ratio points to the cracking of
   long chain alkanes. In addition, when plotting O/C and H/C values in a
   Van Krevelen diagram, additional information about the main chemical
   modifications produced by fire in SOM are described, including
   condensation (oxidation and hydrogenation paralleling) and dealkylation

Abstract = {{The concentrations of soil water-soluble elements (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+,
   NH4+N, NO3-, SO42--S and P), pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were
   monitored over a 15-month period after a wildfire that burned nearly 7
   ha of high mountain broom scrubland in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The
   results showed that the mean values of soil pH, EC and basic cations
   were significantly higher three months after the wildfire in the burned
   area than in samples collected at adjacent, unburned sampling sites, and
   gradually decreased thereafter. The nitric-N increased consistently and
   linearly in time after the wildfire in all the samples, more intensely
   inside the burned area. Mean ammonium-N levels were nearly constant in
   burned and unburned samples almost across the entire study period, and
   increased in the burned area fifteen months after the fire. Sulfate-S
   and P showed no significant variations based on sample status (i.e.,
   burned or unburned) or sampling time, possibly because of their
   particular dynamics in volcanic soils. These results point to a limited
   loss of nutrients, therefore suggesting that the possibility of intense
   post-fire erosion will be low. The nutrient levels found by the end of
   the study period were high enough to support the re-establishment of
   vegetation; however, the effect of alien herbivores on broom seedlings
   could eventually lead to a progressive replacement of the legume
   scrubland in the burned area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aims To explain how plant community copes with a recurring anthropogenic
   forest fire in Himalayan Chir pine forest, it is important to understand
   their postfire regeneration strategies. The primary aim of the study was
   to know: (i) how fire impact soil seed bank composition and (ii) how
   much soil seed bank composition differs with standing vegetation after
   the forest fire.
   Methods Soil samples were collected from burned and adjoining unburned
   sites in blocks using three layers down to 9 cm depth immediately after
   a forest fire and incubated in the net-house for seedling emergence.
   Same sites were revisited during late monsoon/early autumn season to
   know the species composition of standing vegetation recovered after a
   forest fire.
   Important Findings Soil contained viable seeds of >70 species. The
   average seed bank density was 8417 and 14 217 seeds/m(2) in the burned
   and unburned site, respectively. In both sites, it decreased with
   increasing soil depth. Overall fire had no significant impact on seed
   density; however, taking individual layers into consideration, fire had
   a significant impact on seed density only in the uppermost soil layer.
   The species richness of soil seed bank and standing vegetation was 73
   and 100, respectively (with 35 shared species), resulting in a
   similarity of about 40\%. In contrast, >80\% species in soil seed bank
   was found similar between burned and unburned sites. Further, there were
   no significant differences in species richness of standing vegetation in
   burned (87 spp.) and unburned (78 spp.) sites. Our results showed that
   fire had an insignificant impact on soil seed bank composition and
   restoration potential of a plant species from seeds. The understory herb
   and shrub plant community's ability to form a fire-resistant viable soil
   seed bank and capable to recover in the postfire rainy season, explains
   how they reduce the risk of recurring fire damage in maintaining their
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Do anthropogenic disturbances interact with local

   invasive species, which in turn exerts a negative effect on native
   biodiversity?
   Location: Mature Quercus-Carya and Quercus-Carya-Pinus
   (oak-hickory-pine) forests in north Mississippi, USA.
   Methods: We used partial correlation and factor analysis to investigate
   relationships between native ground cover plant species richness and
   composition, percent cover of Lonicera japonica, and local and
   landscape-level environmental variables and disturbance patterns in
   mature upland forests. We directly measured vegetation and environmental
   variables within 34 sampling subplots and quantified the amount of tree
   cover surrounding our plots using digital color aerial photography.
   Results: Simple bivariate correlations revealed that high species
   richness and a high proportion of herbs were associated with low
   Lonicera japonica cover, moist and sandy uncompacted soils, low
   disturbance in the surrounding landscape, and periodic prescribed
   burning. Partial correlations and factor analysis showed that once we
   accounted for the environmental factors, L. japonica cover was the least
   important predictor of composition and among the least important
   predictors of species richness. Hence, much of the negative correlation
   between native species diversity and this invasive species was explained
   by soil texture and local and landscape-level land-use practices.
   Conclusions: We conclude that negative correlations between the
   abundance of invasive species and native plant diversity can occur in
   landscapes with a gradient of human disturbance, regardless of whether
   there is any negative effect of invasive species on native species.}},

Abstract = {{This study was performed to estimate the emission of non-CO2 greenhouse

   methodology adopted the IPCC Guidelines (2003) equation for use on data
   from the Samcheok forest fire gathered using 30 m resolution Landsat TM
   satellite imagery, digital forest type maps, and growing stock
   information per hectare by forest type in 1999. Normalized burn ratio
   (NBR) technique was employed to analyze the area and severity of the
   Samcheok forest fire that occurred in 2000. The differences between NBR
   from pre- and post-fire datasets are examined to determine the extent
   and degree of change detected from burning. The results of burn severity
   analysis by dNBR of the Samcheok forest fire area revealed that a total
   of 16,200 ha of forest were burned. The proportion of the area
   characterized by a `Low' burn severity (dNBR below 152) was 35\%, with
   `Moderate' (dNBR 153-190) and `High' (dNBR 191-255) areas were at 33\%
   and 32\%, respectively. The combustion efficiency for burn severity was
   calculated as 0.43 for crown fire where burn severity was `High', as
   0.40 for `Moderate' severity, and 0.15 for `Low' severity surface fire.
   The emission factors for estimating non-CO2 GHGs were separately applied
   to CO 130, CH4 9, NOx 0.7 and N2O 0.11. Non-CO2 GHGs emissions from

Abstract = {{Many wildlife species require standing dead trees (i.e., snags) as part
   of their habitat. Therefore, the ability to predict future density,
   distribution, and condition of snags can assist resource managers in
   making land-use decisions. Here we present methods for modeling the
   dynamics of snags using data from a 10-yr study on the rates of decay,
   falling, and recruitment of snags on burned and unburned plots in the
   Sierra Nevada, California. Snags (all species) in advanced stages of
   decay usually fell within 5 yr, and snags created by fire decayed
   rapidly and fell quicker (within 10 yr) than those on unburned plots.
   Pine (Pinus spp.) snags decayed more rapidly than fir (Abies spp.).
   Although there was an overall net increase in snag density on unburned
   plots, most of this increase was in the smaller (> 13-38 cm diameter at
   breast height {[}dbh]) size classes; there was a net decrease in the
   larger (> 38 cm dbh) snags preferred by many birds for nesting and
   feeding. Overall, snags remained standing the longest that were larger
   in diameter, shorter in height, less decayed, fir rather than pine, and
   lacking tops. A Leslie matrix model of snag dynamics predicted changes
   in snag decay and density only when adjusted for the specific
   environmental factor(s) causing initial tree mortality. Many snags are
   created by episodic events, such as fire, disease, drought, and insects.
   Models of snag dynamics must include the species and condition of trees
   becoming snags, as well as the factor(s) causing the tree to die. Forest
   managers must consider this episodic creation of snags when developing
   snag-management guidelines, and when planning tree-salvage programs
   based on short-term inventories.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated how climate and plant size affect the

   study was conducted over a period of 10 y, from 1997 to 2007, at a
   savanna site in central Zambia. Trees were marked and monitored
   throughout the entire period; they showed a phase of declining growth
   (1998-2003) and a phase of low growth (2004-2007). During the phase of
   declining growth autocorrelation was high but either weakened or
   disappeared during the phase of low growth. After adjusting data for
   autocorrelation, climate factors and tree size accounted for between
   14\% and 35\% of the variation in annual tree radial growth. However,
   the growth responses of trees to climate factors and tree size varied
   with the source of regeneration (i.e. coppice or seedling) and fire
   treatment. Trees of seedling origin were only affected by climate
   factors and tree size when exposed to annual burning whereas all trees
   of coppice origin were significantly affected by climate factors and
   tree size, regardless of the fire treatment. However, basal radial
   growth of saplings that were monitored for 4 y (2003-2007) was
   significantly influenced by maximum temperature and rainfall that
   accounted for 33-47\% of the variance in annual radial growth under fire
   protection. Saplings recovered from shoot die-back during the cool dry
   season by resprouting in the hot dry season and this annual die-back
   slowed the height growth of B. thonningii saplings.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation-environment relationships are well understood for boreal

   patchiness (patches dominated by lichen, mosses, and vascular plants),

   canopy and edaphic variables in patches of lichen, feathermoss, and
   vascular plants in subalpine lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var.
   latifolia Engelm. ex S. Wats.) forests, in north-central British
   Columbia, Canada. Lichens positively associate with microsites that have
   high light and heat, and low moisture and nutrient availability;
   vascular plants positively associate with base-cation availability,
   sulphur and phosphorus availability, fine-textured soils, thick organic
   layers, and high light; feathermosses positively associate with low
   light and heat, and nitrogen availability. Understory composition is
   most strongly associated with canopy characteristics, but is also
   related to edaphic properties in predictable ways; soil and canopy
   attributes may further interact to define distinct intra-stand niches.
   The viability of caribou winter ranges can likely be extended by
   partially thinning or burning the canopy and organic layers, but the

Abstract = {{Fire provides an impulsive and stochastic pathway for carbon from the
   terrestrial biosphere to enter the atmosphere. Despite fire emissions
   being of similar magnitude to net ecosystem exchange in many biomes,
   even the most complex dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) embedded in
   general circulation models contain poor representations of fire
   behaviour and dynamics, such as propagation and distribution of fire
   sizes. A model-independent methodology is developed which addresses this
   issue. Its focus is on the Arctic where fire is linked to permafrost
   dynamics and on occasion can release great amounts of carbon from
   carbon-rich organic soils. Connected-component labelling is used to
   identify individual fire events across Canada and Russia from daily,
   low-resolution burned area satellite products, and the obtained fire
   size probability distributions are validated against historical data.
   This allows the creation of a fire database holding information on area
   burned and temporal evolution of fires in space and time. A method of
   assimilating the statistical distribution of fire area into a DVM whilst
   maintaining its fire return interval is then described. The algorithm
   imposes a regional scale spatially dependent fire regime on a sub-scale
   spatially independent model; the fire regime is described by large-scale
   statistical distributions of fire intensity and spatial extent, and the
   temporal dynamics (fire return intervals) are determined locally. This
   permits DVMs to estimate many aspects of post-fire dynamics that cannot
   occur under their current representations of fire, as is illustrated by
   considering the modelled evolution of land cover, biomass and net
   ecosystem exchange after a fire.}},

   We surveyed hikers before and after their hike about their familiarity

   found hikers were familiar with topics such as prescribed fire and basic
   fire ecology, but knew little about local ecology or fire regimes.
   Post-hike perceptions of fire and feelings about wildfire in the USA
   were complex and heterogeneous, not predominantly negative. Contrary to
   frequent media descriptions of post-fire landscapes as `devastated' or
   `moonscapes,' many participants described the burned landscape with awe

Abstract = {{Recent studies have interpreted patterns of remotely sensed tree cover
   as evidence that forest with intermediate tree cover might be unstable
   in the tropics, as it will tip into either a closed forest or a more
   open savanna state. Here we show that across all continents the
   frequency of wildfires rises sharply as tree cover falls below similar
   to 40\%. Using a simple empirical model, we hypothesize that the
   steepness of this pattern causes intermediate tree cover (30 +/- 60\%)
   to be unstable for a broad range of assumptions on tree growth and
   fire-driven mortality. We show that across all continents, observed
   frequency distributions of tropical tree cover are consistent with this
   hypothesis. We argue that percolation of fire through an open landscape
   may explain the remarkably universal rise of fire frequency around a
   critical tree cover, but we show that simple percolation models cannot
   predict the actual threshold quantitatively. The fire-driven instability
   of intermediate states implies that tree cover will not change smoothly
   with climate or other stressors and shifts between closed forest and a
   state of low tree cover will likely tend to be relatively sharp and

Abstract = {{Wildfire occurrence is influenced by climate, vegetation and human
   activities. A key challenge for understanding the risk of fires is
   quantifying the mediating effect of vegetation on fire regimes. Here, we
   explore the relative importance of Holocene land cover, land use,
   dominant functional forest type, and climate dynamics on biomass burning
   in temperate and boreo-nemoral regions of central and eastern Europe
   over the past 12 kyr. We used an extensive data set of Holocene pollen
   and sedimentary charcoal records, in combination with climate
   simulations and statistical modelling. Biomass burning was highest
   during the early Holocene and lowest during the mid-Holocene in all
   three ecoregions (Atlantic, continental and boreo-nemoral) but was more
   spatially variable over the past 3-4 kyr. Although climate explained a
   significant variance in biomass burning during the early Holocene, tree
   cover was consistently the highest predictor of past biomass burning
   over the past 8 kyr. In temperate forests, biomass burning was high at
   similar to 45\% tree cover and decreased to a minimum at between 60\%
   and 70\% tree cover. In needleleaf-dominated forests, biomass burning
   was highest at similar to 60 \%-65\% tree cover and steeply declined at
   > 65\% tree cover. Biomass burning also increased when arable lands and
   grasslands reached similar to 15 \%-20 \%, although this relationship
   was variable depending on land use practice via ignition sources, fuel
   type and quantities. Higher tree cover reduced the amount of solar
   radiation reaching the forest floor and could provide moister, more
   wind-protected microclimates underneath canopies, thereby decreasing
   fuel flammability. Tree cover at which biomass burning increased appears
   to be driven by warmer and drier summer conditions during the early
   Holocene and by increasing human influence on land cover during the late
   Holocene. We suggest that long-term fire hazard may be effectively
   reduced through land cover management, given that land cover has
   controlled fire regimes under the dynamic climates of the Holocene.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Can dissimilarity measures of individual plots be used to
   forecast the driving factors among various anthropogenic disturbances
   influencing understorey successional changes?
   Location: Yambulla State Forest, south-eastern Australia (37 degrees 14'
   S, 149 degrees 38' E).
   Methods: Assessments of understorey vegetation communities were taken
   prior to anthropogenic disturbances and at three subsequent time periods
   representing a period of 15 years post-disturbance. Dissimilarities were
   calculated from the original assessment and modelled in a Bayesian
   framework to examine the influence of logging, number of prescribed
   burns and time.
   Results: All sites underwent significant changes over time independently
   of the imposed management regimes. Logging resulted in an immediate
   change in vegetation assemblage which decreased in the subsequent
   assessments. The number of prescribed fires brought greater change in
   the shrub vegetation assemblages, but less change in the ground species
   vegetation assemblages.
   Conclusions: The anthropogenic disturbances did have some role in the
   changes of vegetation assemblages but these were minimal. The ongoing
   changes appear to be a natural response to the last wildfire, which
   passed through the study area in 1973 (13 years prior to the study).
   Forest management practices should consider the influence of wildfire
   succession when planning for the conservation of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The use of fixed-area plot methods was considered unsuitable to compare
   the responses and recovery over time of different miombo woodland
   species to different land-use practices (i.e. charcoal production and
   slash-and-burn agriculture). Young regrowth stages have many stems and
   the older more advanced stages have fewer stems. Different land-use
   practices in miombo woodland impact on the recovery potential of the
   woodlands. Timber harvesting does not result in significant change in
   stocking of the woodland compared to changes in regrowth after
   vegetation clearing for either charcoal production or slash-and-burn
   agriculture. After such clearing the woodland regrowth changes from an
   initial high stocking to a much lower stocking over time. This study in
   Zambian Copperbelt miombo woodland assessed the feasibility to use
   species-stem curves to determine the optimum number of stems or plants
   to record at a sampling point in order to compare species recovery over
   time in regrowth stands 2-15 years after ending the slash-and-burn and
   charcoal production activities. The results show that 34 and 31 stems or
   plants for slash-and-burn and charcoal production regrowth stands,
   respectively, would adequately capture the representative number of
   species to describe the plant community of these regrowth stands. The
   research has also revealed that the use of fixed-area methods would
   result in the measuring of too many plants in one category (younger
   stands) with too few in the other category (advanced stands). Therefore,
   the study explains why, and concludes that, variable plot size is an
   appropriate method for sampling species recovery in regrowth stands.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used to restore and maintain fire-dependent forest
   communities. Because fire affects food and cover resources,
   fire-mediated resource selection has been documented for many wildlife
   species. The first step in understanding these interactions is to
   understand resource selection of the predators in a fire-maintained
   system. We attached GPS radio collars to 27 coyotes (Canis latrans Say,
   1823) and examined resource selection relative to fire-maintained
   vegetation types, years since fire, anthropogenic features that
   facilitate prescribed burning, and other landscape features likely to
   affect coyote resource selection. Coyote home ranges were characterized
   by more open vegetation types and more recently burned forest (i.e.,
   burned 0-1 year prior) than available on the study area. Within their
   home ranges, coyotes avoided areas close to densely vegetated drainages
   and paved roads. Coyote selection of more recently burned forest likely
   was in response to greater prey density or increased ability to detect
   prey soon after vegetation cover was reduced by fires; similarly,
   coyotes likely avoided drainages due to decreased hunting efficiency.
   Coyote resource selection was linked to prescribed fire, suggesting the
   interaction between fire and coyotes may influence ecosystem function in

Abstract = {{The realm of wildland fire science encompasses both wild and prescribed
   fires. Most of the research in the broader field has focused on
   wildfires, however, despite the prevalence of prescribed fires and
   demonstrated need for science to guide its application. We argue that
   prescribed fire science requires a fundamentally different approach to
   connecting related disciplines of physical, natural, and social
   sciences. We also posit that research aimed at questions relevant to
   prescribed fire will improve overall wildland fire science and stimulate
   the development of useful knowledge about managed wildfires. Because
   prescribed fires are increasingly promoted and applied for wildfire
   management and are intentionally ignited to meet policy and land manager
   objectives, a broader research agenda incorporating the unique features
   of prescribed fire is needed. We highlight the primary differences
   between prescribed fire science and wildfire science in the study of
   fuels, fire behavior, fire weather, fire effects, and fire social
   science. Wildfires managed for resource benefits ({''}managed

Abstract = {{Fire is an important control on the carbon (C) balance of the boreal
   forest region. Here, we present findings from two complementary studies
   that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how
   these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in
   black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we
   used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and
   vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and
   unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at
   one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we
   conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE)
   and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design
   of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class
   (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that
   burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased
   temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality
   limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the
   decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the
   hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the
   ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen
   (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our
   field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally
   wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was
   not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of
   variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not
   by burn status, averaging 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) in
   the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex
   general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction
   between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was
   less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites.
   Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales
   suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more
   conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be
   constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate
   quality that impede rates of decomposition.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an active management tool used to address wildfire
   hazard and ecological concerns associated with fire exclusion and
   suppression over the past century. Despite widespread application in the
   United States, there is considerable inconsistency and lack of
   information regarding the extent to which specific outcomes are achieved
   and under what prescribed fire regimes, particularly in regard to
   ecological goals related to plant community structure. We quantify
   differences and patterns in plant functional group abundance, species
   richness and diversity, and other key forest components through time
   from a unique long-term (15-yr) experiment within the Malheur National
   Forest of Oregon. Treatments included five fire regimes: fall and spring
   5-yr burning, fall and spring single burn, and no burning. Original
   burns were conducted in the fall of 1997 and spring of 1998, and plant
   data were collected every five years starting in 2002. Many perennial
   plant group responses were neutral, subtle, and ephemeral. Total cover
   increased marginally in response to the first burn, but this response
   disappeared within a decade. Three 5-yr reburns did not increase or
   decrease total plant cover, richness, or diversity. Some plant groups
   with fire resistant and resilient traits, such as annual forbs, exotic
   forbs, open bunchgrasses, and rhizomatous and resprouting perennials,
   showed some short-term positive responses to initial burning and 1-2
   reburns, but not 3. The moderately more severe fall burns generally
   impacted plant responses more than spring burning, but many patterns
   were legacies from the original higher severity burns. Burn frequency
   was more important for less severe spring burning. Overall, we document
   that most native perennial plant functional groups were able to resist
   or recover from burning and reburning, but did not necessarily strongly
   respond. This may be due to the importance of other overriding forcing
   factors and ecosystem inertia not easily overcome by very low-severity
   prescribed burns. Results from our study are important for practitioners
   using prescribed fire to achieve biodiversity, conservation, and habitat
   goals that hinge on a vigorous native perennial plant response, as such
   outcomes are not certain even with frequent burn regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Neotropical savannas exhibit unique patterns of diversity of plant and
   animal life that are poorly understood. Effective conservation of these
   often imperiled ecosystems requires a basic understanding of species
   occurrence as well as the site-specific factors that influence plant
   community composition. This study focuses on the savanna flora of the
   island of Utila, Bay Islands, Honduras. Compositional trends were
   assessed across multiple environmental gradients including surface
   hydrology, microtopography, nutrient levels and pH using Braun-Blanquet
   cover abundance in a stratified systematic sampling design. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling and non-parametric multiplicative regression
   were applied to identify community types and to model species' responses
   to environmental gradients. We separated habitats into three basic
   types: sedge meadow, Blechnum-Cladium parkland and woody hammock.
   Compositional gradients along ordination axes were highly correlated
   with depth of the water table, pH and conductivity. Disturbance history,
   especially time since fire, was also linked to an indirect gradient.
   Some species - notably Acoelorrhaphe wrightii and Chrysobalanus icaco -
   are generalists, and their distributions may reflect past disturbance.
   Microtopography was critical in determining distribution for a suite of
   species that occurred only on mound formations in areas subject to
   prolonged inundation during the rainy season. Disturbance, particularly
   by hurricanes and fire, may promote within-habitat diversity; for
   example, the exposed lignotubers and rhizomes of trees killed by saline
   inundation provide habitat for less flood-tolerant species in wet areas,
   while burned clones of A. wrightii and surrounding peat areas permit
   colonization by many herbaceous species. Pair-wise floristic comparisons
   between Utila and eight other neotropical savannas revealed fewer than
   half of the 40 savanna species found on Utila were present in any other
   site. Two species of Cyperaceae, Fuirena scirpoidea and Rhynchospora
   tracyi, are new records for Honduras.}},

   hydrological response of the once vegetated areas. This study presents
   the investigation of wildfires impact on the hydrological response of
   the small scale experimental watershed of Lykorrema stream, which is
   located in the east side of Penteli Mountain, Attica, Greece. In the
   recent years, the watershed was affected by two wildfires in August 1995
   and in August 2009. The effect of the August 1995 wildfire on the peak
   runoff was investigated in a previous study, in which an increment of 10
   times in peak runoff was observed. This paper presents the results of an
   analysis concerning the impact of the second wildfire on the watershed's
   hydrological response based on the available detailed spatial physical
   and hydro-meteorological data. The results obtained highlight the
   considerable impact of forest fire on the watersheds hydrological
   response. An increment in the direct runoff depths and the peak flow
   rates as much as 230\% and 850\% respectively was observed during the
   first two years of the post-fire period.}},

Abstract = {{Triodia spp. have been described as behaving functionally as a shrub
   because above ground biomass accumulates slowly over time culminating as
   the dominant vegetation layer. When combined with high flammability,
   little seed dormancy and conflicting evidence for fire induced seed
   germination, obligate seeding species may be more vulnerable to short
   fire intervals than resprouting species. This study investigated the
   post-fire regeneration response of the obligate seeder Triodia sp. nov.
   (aff. T. schinzii Henrard) in the fire prone Kimberley, Western
   Australia. Adult plants were destroyed by fire in experimental plots to
   assess the degree of regeneration from either resprouting or germination
   from seed due to fire. To control for the removal of adults, without
   fire, plants were pulled out by hand in replicate plots. Germination of
   Triodia sp. nov. seed from the soil seed bank was strongly induced by
   fire. Establishment and survival of seedlings through the first dry
   season was high with a small proportion of individuals flowering at this

Abstract = {{Although it is well known that fire can exert strong control on stand
   structure, composition, and dynamics in savannas and woodlands, the
   relationship between fire frequency and stand structure has been
   characterized in few of the world's savanna and woodland ecosystems. To
   address this issue in temperate oak-dominated ecosystems, we studied the
   effects of fire frequency on stand structure and dynamics in oak savanna
   and woodland stands that had been burned 0-26 times in 32 yr, in the
   Anoka Sand Plain region of Minnesota (USA).
   Seedling densities declined with increasing fire frequency, but
   differentially, for northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), black
   cherry (Prunus serotina), serviceberry (Amelanchier sp.), and red maple
   (Acer rubrum). Bur oak (Q. macrocarpa) seedling density was not
   sensitive to fire frequency. Frequent burning (at least three fires per
   decade) prevented development of a sapling layer and canopy ingrowth.
   Low-frequency burning (fewer than two fires per decade) produced stands
   with dense sapling thickets.
   Reductions in overstory density and basal area from 1984 to 1995 were
   observed for all stands burned two or more times during that period.
   Basal area declined by 4-7\% per year, and density declined by 6-8\% per
   year in stands burned four or more times. Mortality rates in burned
   stands were higher for northern pin oak (50\%) than for bur oak (8\%).
   Northern pin oak mortality was highest for small trees (< 20 cm dbh) and
   lowest for mature trees (30-40 cm dbh); mortality increased with fire
   frequency. Bur oak mortality declined with increasing fire frequency.
   Attempts to preserve and maintain savannas as a viable ecosystem type in
   this region will require a long-term commitment to restoration-based
   management, with prescribed fire as a central tool. Burn frequency
   treatments with four or more fires per decade produce similar reductions
   in stem density and stand basal area but may lead to unsustainable oak
   tree populations. Within this general range, fire frequencies at a
   decadal scale should be chosen to address other management objectives,
   including suppressing shrubs and promoting increased cover of grasses
   and other herbaceous species. Fire management with a long-term view may
   also require periodic respites to allow for new cohorts of mature oak
   trees.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying and documenting succession has been a challenge to

   do not seem to have been widely adopted. We propose the use of an
   intuitive and quantifiable measure that is amenable to both model
   building and hypothesis testing, and apply the method to a long-term,
   ongoing succession project in southeastern Ontario. We compare our
   measure with turnover rate (Diamond 1969) and lambda (Shugart and Hett
   1973). We found that although these measures can determine when change
   within the community is occurring, the nature of this change and the
   resultant composition of the community is not readily gleaned from the
   measure. Our measure, by grouping plants as either `early' or `late',
   allows the relative composition of the community to be understood with a
   single number. The benefit of using an aggregate measure such as ours,
   is that a variety of questions can be examined, such as `when will a
   community revert to its original composition following fire?' As an
   example, we utilized our measure on a post-fire succession data set from
   northern Montana. The results estimate that sites will take anywhere
   from 3 to 100 years to return to their pre-fire composition, based on

Abstract = {{After fires in 1984 and 1989 at Whangamarino wetland, and in 1972 at
   Moanatuatua Bog, peatland flora and vegetation were monitored to
   determine rates and patterns of recovery. Species with rhizomes that
   survived the fires were able to resprout and grow rapidly in the initial
   post-fire period. Species that were eliminated had to re-establish from
   seed and so recovered more slowly. The vegetation at Moanatuatua took
   almost 12 years to recover to pre-fire condition, twice as long as at
   Whangamarino. Adventive and early colonising native species were
   prominent only in the first 1-2 post-fire years, probably because of
   temporarily increased availability of nutrients and/or open habitat.
   Ordination techniques arranged the plots and species in a sequence from
   shrub-sedgeland (Whangamarino), through Empodisma minus restiad rushland
   (Whangamarino), to Sporadanthus traversii/Empodisma restiad rushland
   (Moanatuatua) following a gradient of decreasing fertility with time.
   Fires reset the bog development process but generally do not alter the
   recovery pathways. In the absence of future major disturbance, including
   invasion by troublesome adventive species, the younger Whangamarino
   peatlands are expected to develop eventually into floristically poor,
   oligotrophic raised bogs similar to those at Moanatuatua and elsewhere
   in the Waikato district.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed two savanna sites, one on flat terrain with deep soil (DS),

   (RS), before and after an accidental fire. We found that the fire did
   not cause any significant changes in the species composition or
   diversity of either community, and did not result in floristic
   homogenization. However, we did record a reduction in the density of
   plants and in basal area in the DS savanna in comparison with the RS
   savanna, as well as a higher rate of basal sprouting, which indicates a
   trade-off between mortality and sprouting. We conclude that, whereas
   post-fire changes in vegetation structure were more pronounced in the DS
   savanna than in the RS, the difference in the underlying substrate did
   not have a direct influence on the post-fire composition of woody
   species. The greater grass biomass found in the DS savanna in comparison
   with the RS savanna appears to have been the principal modulator of the
   severity of the fires in the two phytophysionogmies, and accounts for
   the distinct responses to fire we observed in the two woody communities.}},

Abstract = {{This study addressed the impacts of contrasting pre-fire ground
   preparation operations on post-fire runoff and inter-rill erosion in six
   eucalypt plantations in north-central Portugal, with a special emphasis
   on the role of soil water repellency in the seasonal patterns of
   overland flow generation. To this end, a down slope ploughed, a contour
   ploughed and a terraced site were compared with three unploughed sites.
   Runoff and erosion data were collected in the field by carrying out
   rainfall simulation experiments (RSEs) with two intensities (45-50 and
   80-85 mm h(-1)) at six occasions during the first one to two years
   following wildfires in 2005 and 2006.
   Overall runoff coefficients varied markedly amongst the six study sites
   and between the two intensities (7 to 55\%). While runoff figures were
   comparable to those of prior RSE studies in recently burnt areas,
   overall sediment losses were comparatively low (7-155 g m(-2)) but
   contained a substantial organic matter fraction (29-74\%). Apparently,
   the inter-rill erosion rates were essentially sediment-limited, fitting
   in with the long history of intensive land use that is typical in the
   Mediterranean Basin. The hydrological and erosion impacts of the three
   pre-fire ground preparation operations were minor, probably because
   these operations took place several years before the latest wildfire.
   Overall, the two rainfall intensities produced the expected differences
   but this effect was only statistically significant for simultaneous
   RSEs. Furthermore, the effect of rainfall intensity varied markedly
   between the study sites and, occasionally, between the two plot pairs at
   the same site. This impeded an erosion risk ranking of the six study
   sites that was consistent for both rainfall intensities. Runoff and
   erosion rates did not decrease in a simple or pronounced manner with
   time-since-fire. These temporal patterns could in part be attributed to
   changes in soil water repellency but other factors were involved as
   well. Removal of the protective soil cover by litter in particular
   appeared to play a key role in the increase in sediment losses following
   logging and wood extraction. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many shrubland bird species are declining in eastern North America and
   as a result forest managers have used a variety of techniques to provide
   breeding habitat for these species. The maintenance of permanent
   ``wildlife openings{''} using prescribed burns or mechanical treatments
   is a widely used approach for providing habitat for these species, but
   there have been no studies of the effects of treatment regime on bird
   abundance and nest survival in managed wildlife openings. We studied
   shrubland birds in wildlife openings on the White Mountain National
   Forest (WMNF) in New Hampshire and Maine, USA, during 2003 and 2004. We
   analyzed bird abundance and nest survival in relation to treatment type
   (burned versus mowed), treatment frequency, time since treatment, and
   patch area. We found that wildlife openings provided habitat for
   shrubland birds that are not present in mature forest. There was
   relatively modest support for models of focal bird species abundance as
   a function of treatment regime variables, despite pronounced effects of
   treatment on habitat conditions. This probably was attributable to the
   combined effects of complex site histories and bird site fidelity.
   Overall nest success (52\%) was comparable to other types of
   early-successional habitats in the region, but there were few supported
   relationships between nest survival and treatment variables. We conclude
   that wildlife openings provide quality habitat for shrubland birds of
   high conservation interest as long as managers ensure treatment
   intervals are long enough to permit the development of woody vegetation
   characteristic of the later stages of this sere. Also, wildlife openings
   should be large enough to accommodate the territory sizes of all target
   species, which was >= 1.2 ha in this study. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Ips sexdentatus (Burner, 1776) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae)
   is one of the most devastating pests of coniferous forests in Turkey.
   The pest not only kills individual host trees, but also it can outbreak
   readily and cause great damage under favorable conditions. Distribution
   and damage of this pest vary depending on some biotic and abiotic
   factors (e.g. edge effect, climatic factors, and host plant). The
   present study investigated the edge effect of Pinus nigra Arnold stands
   on the population level and the body length of I. sexdentatus. For this
   purpose, edge effects of P. nigra forests on I. sexdentatus were studied
   at Kastamonu Regional Directorate of State Forests located in
   northwestern black sea region of Turkey in the years 2012-2013. Three
   factors (forest interior, forest edge, and forest exterior) were used to
   test the effects of forest edges on the abundance and body length of I.
   sexdentatus. A number of five study sites were selected to deploy
   Lindgren (R) funnel-type pheromone traps. Fifteen unit traps baited with
   commercial pheromone Ipssex (R) were set in 5 replicate blocks of three
   traps per block. The results of the study were as follows: 1) Double
   bark thicknesses and diameter of the trees along the forest edges were
   significantly higher than those in forest interior; 2) The number of I.
   sexdentatus captured from forest outside and forest edge was
   significantly higher than those in forest interior; 3) Body length of I.
   sexdentatus was significantly higher on trees along the forest edges
   than those in forest interior.}},

Abstract = {{Across the western United States, the three primary drivers of tree
   mortality and carbon balance are bark beetles, timber harvest, and
   wildfire. While these agents of forest change frequently overlap,
   uncertainty remains regarding their interactions and influence on
   specific subsequent fire effects such as change in canopy cover.
   Acquisition of pre- and post-fire Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
   data on the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon provided an
   opportunity to isolate and quantify fire effects coincident with
   specific agents of change. This study characterizes the influence of
   pre-fire mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) and timber
   harvest disturbances on LiDAR-estimated change in canopy cover. Observed
   canopy loss from fire was greater (higher severity) in areas
   experiencing pre-fire MPB (Delta 18.8\%CC) than fire-only (Delta
   11.1\%CC). Additionally, increasing MPB intensity was directly related
   to greater canopy loss. Canopy loss was lower for all areas of pre-fire
   timber harvest (Delta 3.9\%CC) than for fire-only, but among harvested
   areas, the greatest change was observed in the oldest treatments and the
   most intensive treatments {[}i.e., stand clearcut (Delta 5.0\%CC) and
   combination of shelterwood establishment cuts and shelterwood removal
   cuts (Delta 7.7\%CC)]. These results highlight the importance of
   accounting for and understanding the impact of pre-fire agents of change
   such as MPB and timber harvest on subsequent fire effects in land
   management planning. This work also demonstrates the utility of
   multi-temporal LiDAR as a tool for quantifying these landscape-scale
   interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of traditional forest management practices (i.e.
   forest exploitation activities such as burning, cutting and livestock
   grazing) on carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages in
   Pyrenean oak forests of NW Spain. A total of 11 370 carabid individuals
   representing 61 species were collected by pitfall trapping from May to
   October 2004 in four types of traditionally managed oak ecosystems:
   ``dehesa{''}, ``mature open{''}, ``mature closed{''} and ``young{''}.
   These four management types experienced a variety of anthropogenic
   activities, resulting in differences in the structure and composition of
   the tree and understorey vegetation layers. We showed that the four
   management types were quite similar at the carabid assemblage level,
   mainly supporting open habitat and generalist species. The ``dehesa{''}
   system was most distinct with a higher species richness (not
   significantly) and with several unique species, probably travelling from
   the adjacent grassland. However, many species responded significantly to
   the type of management, depending on the habitat associations of the
   species. We also found strong responses of some of the species to one
   type of management, either positive (exclusively collected from one
   management type) or negatively (completely absent). Shrub cover and soil
   organic matter content were the main environmental variables determining
   the carabid assemblage structure. At the regional scale, the four
   management types accounted for a high carabid beetle diversity. This
   diversity appears to be threatened by landscape homogenization, since
   traditional management practices are disappearing due to recent land-use
   changes in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The second channel species, Callistemon pityoides F.Muell., did not

   evidence for soil-stored dormancy related to temperature and or

Abstract = {{Drought, fire, and windstorms can interact to degrade tropical forests
   and the ecosystem services they provide, but how these forests recover
   after catastrophic disturbance events remains relatively unknown. Here,
   we analyze multi-year measurements of vegetation dynamics and function
   (fluxes of CO2 and H2O) in forests recovering from 7 years of controlled
   burns, followed by wind disturbance. Located in southeast Amazonia, the
   experimental forest consists of three 50-ha plots burned annually,
   triennially, or not at all from 2004 to 2010. During the subsequent
   6-year recovery period, postfire tree survivorship and biomass sharply
   declined, with aboveground C stocks decreasing by 70\%-94\% along forest
   edges (0-200 m into the forest) and 36\%-40\% in the forest interior.
   Vegetation regrowth in the forest understory triggered partial canopy
   closure (70\%-80\%) from 2010 to 2015. The composition and spatial
   distribution of grasses invading degraded forest evolved rapidly, likely
   because of the delayed mortality. Four years after the experimental
   fires ended (2014), the burned plots assimilated 36\% less carbon than
   the Control, but net CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) had fully
   recovered 7 years after the experimental fires ended (2017). Carbon
   uptake recovery occurred largely in response to increased light-use
   efficiency and reduced postfire respiration, whereas increased water use
   associated with postfire growth of new recruits and remaining trees
   explained the recovery in ET. Although the effects of interacting
   disturbances (e.g., fires, forest fragmentation, and blowdown events) on
   mortality and biomass persist over many years, the rapid recovery of
   carbon and water fluxes can help stabilize local climate.}},

   summers after fire.  The deeprooted resprouters did not show water

Abstract = {{Fixed-width buffer zones on rivers and streams are designed to protect
   the diverse riparian community and its important function in the

   western forests have become more fire prone because of restrictions on
   fuel reduction treatments within buffer zones. Surprisingly little is
   known about where and how the plant community transitions from riparian
   to upland vegetation, but understanding that transition would inform the
   restoration of riparian forest structure and function and its associated
   management applications (e.g., prescribed fire or mechanical thinning)
   that may be necessary to achieve restoration. Using data collected from
   the Kings River Experimental Watersheds, we assessed the transition in
   plant structure and composition from riparian near-stream areas to
   upland locations, in mixed-conifer and red fir forests on headwater
   streams of the southern Sierra Nevada, CA. Our data strongly support the
   conclusion that the riparian zone, as evidenced by the riparian plant
   community, extends beyond 10 m from the stream on these narrow,
   first-and second-order streams. The herbaceous community at 10 m from
   the stream was distinct from the upland community and had greater
   similarity to locations closer to the stream in mixed-conifer forest.
   Species richness was three to four times greater in riparian areas
   compared with upland areas, and there was little overlap of the
   more-abundant herbaceous species. In addition, riparian forests were
   generally denser, with smaller trees in mixed-conifer forest, but had
   similar stand structure to upland forests in red fir forest. Differences
   between mixed-conifer and red fir forests may reflect different
   departures from the historical fire regime in these two community types.
   Compared with riparian areas of wetter climates, riparian areas of dry
   climates, such as the Sierra Nevada, may harbor even greater species
   diversity relative to nearby upland areas, indicating that buffer zones
   of restricted management may be justified in these forests if the goal
   is the preservation of biodiversity. However, perhaps more important,
   these findings, along with recent literature, highlight the need to
   identify site-specific goals when undertaking restoration of riparian
   forests in the western USA: herbaceous biodiversity, fuels reduction,
   historic tree composition and structure, and/or water quality.}},

Abstract = {{(Tree community dynamics in a semideciduous forest under recurrent

   fire. Areas of semideciduous forest in Parque Estadual da Serra Azul,
   Barra do Garcas (MT, Brazil), exposed to different frequencies of fire,
   were monitored: 0.9 ha burned in 2007 (Q1) and 0.9 ha in 2005 and 2007
   (Q2). The dynamics were based on the average interval of 2.02 years
   between T1 (outubro/2006-maio/2007) and 12 (March/2009), including
   individuals with PAP >= 15 cm. Diversity (H') and species richness
   (estimated by Jackknife) were higher in Q2, in both at T1 and T2. The
   decrease of tree density between surveys was significant for Q1 and Q2,
   but the proportion of deaths was higher in Q1. There were no differences
   in the dynamic parameters between Q1 and Q2 when considering both the
   number of individuals and basal area. The increase of diversity in Q2
   may be partially explained by the hypothesis of intermediate
   disturbance. However, despite the absence of differences in recruitment
   and mortality between Q I and Q2, the high turnover rates, independent
   of fire frequency, suggest future changes in the flora and structure of
   the forest if fire continues to be frequent in the area.}},

   The relative abundance of the different species in both treatments was
   linearly correlated with their relative abundance in control plots.
   Moreover, we found species-specific responses to treatments. Drought and
   warming treatment reduced the competitive ability of the obligate seeder
   tree Pinus halepensis against native resprouter shrubs and consequently,
   the transformation from shrub to pine tree dominated vegetation was
   slowed down. Conversely, the water use strategy of Globularia alypum may
   allow this species to maintain a dominant position in drought plots.
   Therefore, future drier and warmer conditions in Mediterranean areas may

Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{The reintroduction of fire to landscapes where it was once common is
   considered a priority to restore historical forest dynamics, including
   reducing tree density and decreasing levels of woody biomass on the
   forest floor. However, reintroducing fire causes tree mortality that can
   have unintended ecological outcomes related to woody biomass, with
   potential impacts to fuel accumulation, carbon sequestration, subsequent
   fire severity, and forest management. In this study, we examine the
   interplay between fire and carbon dynamics by asking how reintroduced
   fire impacts fuel accumulation, carbon sequestration, and subsequent
   fire severity potential. Beginning pre-fire, and continuing 6 years
   post-fire, we tracked all live, dead, and fallen trees >= 1 cm in
   diameter and mapped all pieces of deadwood (downed woody debris)
   originating from tree boles >= 10 cm diameter and >= 1 m in length in
   25.6 ha of anAbies concolor/Pinus lambertianaforest in the central
   Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We also tracked surface fuels along 2240
   m of planar transects pre-fire, immediately post-fire, and 6 years
   post-fire. Six years after moderate-severity fire, deadwood >= 10 cm
   diameter was 73 Mg ha(-1), comprised of 32 Mg ha(-1)that persisted
   through fire and 41 Mg ha(-1)of newly fallen wood (compared to 72 Mg
   ha(-1)pre-fire). Woody surface fuel loading was spatially heterogeneous,
   with mass varying almost four orders of magnitude at the scale of 20 m x
   20 m quadrats (minimum, 0.1 Mg ha(-1); mean, 73 Mg ha(-1); maximum, 497
   Mg ha(-1)). Wood from large-diameter trees (>= 60 cm diameter) comprised
   57\% of surface fuel in 2019, but was 75\% of snag biomass, indicating
   high contributions to current and future fuel loading. Reintroduction of
   fire does not consume all large-diameter fuel and generates high levels
   of surface fuels >= 10 cm diameter within 6 years. Repeated fires are
   needed to reduce surface fuel loading.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean saline steppes hold plant communities adapted to saline

   spatio-temporal patterns of the soil seed bank, which tends to
   accumulate under plant patches. In this study, we evaluated the recover
   ability of soil seed banks and possible changes in their spatial
   patterns during the earliest post-fire phases in a saline steppe, when
   the extant vegetation was temporally removed in the habitat. The study
   was carried out in El Saladar de Cordovilla (Tobarra, Albacete) after a
   fire in the late summer of 2011. To do this we proceeded to track and
   collect soil samples during the subsequent year and a half to fire. The
   seed in samples were identified and the results were subjected to
   various statistical analyses. The results showed that 18 months were not
   enough to recovery the original composition of soil seed bank in
   continental saline steppes, because after a fire the plant patches
   structure disappear temporarily, at least from original places, so their
   effect on spatial patterns of soil seed bank distribution are

Abstract = {{Wildfire in California annual grasslands is an important ecological
   disturbance and ecosystem control. Regional and global climate changes
   that affect aboveground biomass will alter fire-related nutrient loading
   and promote increased frequency and severity of fire in these systems.
   This can have long-term impacts on soil microbial dynamics and nutrient
   cycling, particularly in N-limited systems such as annual grasslands. We
   examined the effects of a low-severity fire on microbial biomass and
   specific microbial lipid biomarkers over 3 years following a fire at the
   Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment. We also examined the impact of
   fire on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), specifically
   Nitrosospira Cluster 3a ammonia-oxidizers, and nitrification rates 9
   months post-fire. Finally, we examined the interactive effects of fire
   and three other global change factors (N-deposition, precipitation and
   CO2) on plant biomass and soil microbial communities for three growing
   seasons after fire. Our results indicate that a low-severity fire is
   associated with earlier season primary productivity and higher soil-NH4
   (+) concentrations in the first growing season following fire.
   Belowground productivity and total microbial biomass were not influenced
   by fire. Diagnostic microbial lipid biomarkers, including those for
   Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, were reduced by fire
   9- and 21-months post-fire, respectively. All effects of fire were
   indiscernible by 33-months post-fire, suggesting that above and
   belowground responses to fire do not persist in the long-term and that
   these grassland communities are resilient to fire disturbance. While
   N-deposition increased soil NH4 (+), and thus available NH3, AOB
   abundance, nitrification rates and Cluster 3a AOB, similar increases in
   NH3 in the fire plots did not affect AOB or nitrification. We
   hypothesize that this difference in response to N-addition involves a
   mediation of P-limitation as a result of fire, possibly enhanced by
   increased plant competition and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-plant
   associations after fire.}},

Abstract = {{Southeastern hardwood forests burn infrequently and are characterized by
   high habitat and microsite diversity. Rare plants of these forests are
   mostly herbs associated with specific habitats (e.g., hardwood coves,
   wetlands) or other geographic regions. Habitat prediction models for
   rare plants can be useful when large areas must be surveyed or
   populations must be established. We developed a habitat prediction model
   for four species of southeastern hardwood forests: Nestronia umbellula,
   Carex chapmanii, Rhododendron flammeum, and Habenaria lacera. The model
   suggests that the Carer has strong affinity to habitat resource and
   vegetation conditions. In contrast, Nestronia umbellula is not strongly
   associated with habitat characteristics. The model did not accurately
   predict N. umbellula habitat, possibly because it did not account for
   this plant's clonal and partially parasitic habit or its tolerance of
   periodic burning. Rhododendron flammeum is strongly associated with
   specific topographic variables, and the model fairly accurately
   predicted its habitat. Although H. lacera is strongly associated with
   habitat resources and vegetation, its habitat is small in area and was
   not well predicted by the GIS-based model. These four examples suggest
   that models based on resource and vegetation characteristics can
   accurately predict habitat, but only when plants are strongly associated
   with these variables and the scale of modeling coincides with habitat
   size. Habitat prediction models can be useful tools for managing rare
   plants of southeastern hardwood forests, especially when combined with

Abstract = {{Little information is available comparing historic and modern sand
   savannas, and how remnants respond to restored fire. We compared short-
   and long-term effects of restored fire on the Tefft Savanna, a 197 ha
   eastern sand savanna in northwest Indiana that had undergone three
   decades of fire protection. U.S. Public Land Survey data from Tefft in
   1833 indicate black and white oak barrens, and pin oak savanna, with
   trees averaging 50 stems/ha and 4 m(2)/ha basal area. We used ordination
   and a digital elevation model to assess topographic distribution of tree
   species in 1986. In 1986, we also compared initial effects of high- and
   low-intensity dormant season fire on woody vegetation among nine blocks
   containing black oak, white oak, and pin oak stands. Twenty years later,
   we compared the same blocks, all of which had been burned three times
   per decade with low-intensity fires. In 1986, black oak, white oak and
   pin oak occurred across a gradient of decreasing elevation and slope. At
   that time, unburned black oak and white oak stands averaged >400
   stems/ha and about 10 m(2)/ha basal area, and their smaller size classes
   contained non-oak woody vegetation that apparently had invaded with fire
   exclusion. After initial burns, black oak and white oak stands receiving
   high-intensity fire averaged <200 stems/ha and had significantly lower
   oak canopy cover and basal area than unburned stands. Stands receiving
   low-intensity fire had intermediate oak canopy cover, with basal area
   similar to unburned stands. Pin oak stands were more fire-resistant,
   apparently because spring flooding often reduced fire effects. Density,
   cover and basal area of non-oak tree species were much lower than oaks,
   and were not reduced by initial burning. Repeated low-intensity burning
   over 20 years tended to maintain structure caused by initial fires.
   However, it reduced lower size class stem densities, promoted post-fire
   sprouting into the shrub layer, and allowed oak basal area to increase
   in larger size classes. Time since fire regulated shrub layer structure
   on a 4-year cycle. Density and cover of trees and shrubs returned to
   pre-burn conditions by the second and fourth growing seasons after fire,
   respectively, with non-oak tree species exceeding pre-burn cover and
   density by the fourth season. These results suggest that high-intensity
   fire is more important than repeated low-intensity burning in
   structuring and restoring eastern sand savanna, and that non-oak tree
   species, once established, may be resistant to low-intensity fire. (C)

   Zealand. During the late-glacial/early Holocene these subalpine sites
   supported grassland/shrubland vegetation. Trees or tall scrub were
   absent. Tree ferns became increasingly common in the early Holocene,
   most likely as small stands in damp, sheltered locations. At 7500 yr
   B.P. a coniferous forest of Prumnopitys taxifolia, Dacrycarpus
   dacrydioides and Podocarpus abruptly replaced the previous grassland
   communities at lower altitudes, while a coniferous scrub of Phyllocladus
   alpinus and Halocarpus bidwillii formed the upper treeline. The
   reafforestation of Central Otago and adjacent regions was completed 2000
   years after podocarp-dominant forest began to occupy coastal regions.
   The delay is attributed to drier climates in the interior of the
   southern South Island during the early Holocene. From 6000 yr B.P.
   Nothofagus menziesii began to spread through the higher altitude forest,
   and shortly after 3000 yr B.P. N. fusca type forest began to replace the
   previous treeline dominants, Phyllocladus and Halocarpus. Treeline may
   have risen slightly in the mid to late Holocene. From 600 yr B.P.,
   repeated fires destroyed both lowland and upland forest and tall scrub
   communities. First bracken, and then grassland, replaced the burnt

Abstract = {{Increasing surface temperatures due to climate change have the potential
   to alter plant litter mass loss and nutrient release during
   decomposition. However, a great deal of uncertainty remains concerning
   how ecosystem functioning may be affected by interactions between
   warming and other drivers, such as plant functional group composition
   and environmental context. In this study, we investigated how vascular
   plant litter decomposition and nutrient release were affected by
   experimental warming, moss removal and shrub removal along a post-fire
   boreal forest successional gradient. Our results show that litter
   decomposition and nutrient loss were primarily driven by understory
   plant functional group removal. The removal of mosses generally reduced
   litter mass loss and increased litter phosphorus (P) loss, while shrub
   removal typically increased litter mass loss and in one litter species
   reduced immobilization of P. Litter nitrogen (N) loss was unaffected by
   plant functional group removal. Warming interacted with successional
   stage and species identity of the litter decomposed, but these effects
   were uncommon and generally weak. As climate change advances, moss cover
   is expected to decrease, while shrub cover is expected to increase.
   Taken together with our results, this suggests that lower moss cover
   will decrease leaf litter decomposition rates and increase P release
   from litter, while increasing shrub cover will decrease decomposition
   rates and may reduce P release from litter. Our results demonstrate that
   in the short term, the direct effects of warming and successional stage
   will play a relatively minor role in driving litter decomposition
   processes in the boreal forest. In the long term, as the climate warms,
   temperature and its indirect effects via changes in the understory
   vegetation will play an important role in driving litter decomposition,
   thereby potentially altering C storage and nutrient cycling. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Clear-cutting and fire are the two main disturbances affecting the
   boreal forest of eastern Canada. These two disturbance types exert
   different effects on forest dynamics, which can have major implications
   in terms of economic and ecological sustainability. This study compared
   the long-term effects of these two disturbance types on stand
   composition, stand density, and merchantable volume on eastern Canadian
   mesic boreal forests dominated by black spruce and balsam fir. We used
   157 permanent sample plots (PSP), 41 of which originated from fire and
   116 were from clear-cuts. Model selection with finite-sample corrected
   Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) was used to understand which factors
   had the greatest influence on relative stand density and merchantable
   volume. Our results indicate that merchantable volume was positively
   influenced by stand density, which in turn was primarily influenced by
   disturbance origin, with post-cutting stands being denser than post-fire
   stands. These results indicated that an increase in stand density is an
   important mechanism through which disturbance acts upon merchantable
   volume. We also found differences in forest composition between
   stand-origin categories, with balsam fir being more abundant
   post-clearcutting; this was likely because advance regeneration was
   mainly composed of balsam fir, whereas post-fire stands are dominated by
   black spruce. Differences in merchantable volume between post-fire and
   post-clearcut stands become non-significant with time, likely because of
   higher tree growth and lower mortality in the dominant canopy of
   clearcut-origin stands. Overall, the results indicate that stand origin
   is an important determinant of stand composition and stand yield, but
   that the latter effect tends to disappear after a few decades. The
   higher balsam fir content generally observed in naturally regenerated,
   clear-cut origin stands could have potentially negative economic and
   ecological impacts at the landscape scale, which may call for mitigation
   strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{248-256}},
Abstract = {{Delayed seedling emergence can negatively affect plant recruitment.
   Recent work has shown that some species with innate seasonal
   requirements for germination can have seedling emergence delayed,
   depending on the season of fire. The impact of this delay, which is in
   relation to both resprouters and seedlings of species that emerge
   independent of season, remains unknown. I assessed delayed emergence and
   subsequent impacts on post-fire recruitment success of three Leucopogon
   species, which all display a seasonal emergence pattern related to their
   physiological dormancy. Intra-population comparisons showed that both
   small (1-6 months) and much larger (12-15 months) delays of emergence
   reduced seedling survival and growth, and increased the time taken for
   plants to reach maturity. Fire season induced delays produced very
   similar results, with higher mortality and slower growth after winter
   fires compared with post-summer fire cohorts. Seasonal emergence
   patterns, associated with seed dormancy and germination cues, may
   therefore provide a mechanism that determines the variation of
   recruitment success after fires in different seasons. A better
   understanding of the relationship between fire season and timing of
   emergence of physiologically dormant species would be timely considering
   the forecast widening of the fire season due to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation and birds were inventoried on the same plot before and after
   a severe windstorm in 1999 disturbed a mature black spruce (Picea
   mariana)-jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest in northern Minnesota.
   Following the storm, another plot was established in an adjacent portion
   of the forest that was salvage-logged. Birds were inventoried on both
   plots through 2002. The original unsalvaged plot was prescribed-burned
   in 2004, but vegetation was surveyed through 2003, and through 2005 on
   the salvaged plot. We examined the effects of wind disturbance by
   comparing the pre-storm bird and vegetation communities with those
   developing afterwards through 2002 and 2003, respectively, and the
   effects of salvage logging by comparing vegetation and the bird
   community on the unsalvaged plot with those in the salvaged area. Wind
   reduced the canopy of the forest by over 90\% with a temporary increase
   in the shrub layer, mostly resulting from tip-ups. Several plant
   species, including jack pine and beaked hazel (Corylus americana),
   appeared temporarily in the ground layer (<1 m height), but did not
   persist through 2003. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) root sprouts
   were abundant in 2001, but decreased dramatically by 2003. Delayed
   mortality of tipped trees resulted in reduction of the shrub layer to
   pre-storm levels, and release of advanced regeneration black spruce and
   balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Bird species using the forest changed from
   dominance by canopy-foraging species to ground-brush foraging species,
   with an overall increase in bird diversity. Salvage logging resulted in
   significant reduction in coarse woody debris, and successful recruitment
   of jack pine seedlings. Quaking aspen sprouts were nearly 30 times more
   abundant in the salvage-logged area compared to the unsalvaged control.
   Ruderal species, especially red raspberry (Rubus ideaus), fringed
   bindweed (Polygonum cilinode), and several sedges (Carex spp.), were
   significantly more abundant after salvage logging. The bird community,
   on the other hand, was greatly diminished by salvage logging, with a
   reduction in diversity, density, and overall richness of species.}},

Abstract = {{Eryngium cuneifolium Small. (Apiaceae) is a narrowly distributed endemic

   analyses using 22 microhabitat characteristics indicated significant
   microhabitat and time-since-fire effects on survival, growth, and
   fecundity of 1287 individuals over a 4-yr period. Survival increased
   with distance to the nearest shrub, and plants in larger open patches
   had greater survival rates. Neighboring shrubs of Ceratiola ericoides
   and Calamintha ashei were associated with a higher mortality of E.
   cuneifolium than other neighboring shrub species. Survival was reduced
   by two-thirds over 4 yr (14\% vs. 42\%) for E. cuneifolium near C.
   ericoides. Sand accretion increased growth and fecundity. With greater
   time since fire, woody shrubs increasingly dominate and open patches
   shrink, significantly reducing survival, growth, and fecundity of E.
   cuneifolium. Effects were particularly dramatic between 2 and 7 yr
   postfire, when annual mortality increased from <10\% to >30\% (r =

Abstract = {{Oak woodlands are dependent on frequent fire to maintain the low stem
   density and diverse understories that typify these ecosystems. Without
   this recurrent disturbance, fire-sensitive conifer competitors encroach
   on oaks, reducing their vigor, and diminishing habitat quality. In
   fire-excluded oak woodlands, stand-replacing wildfire can trigger shifts
   in canopy dominance from seed-generated conifers to oaks, which are
   capable of vigorous sprouting following topkill. We examined the
   occurrence and sprouting dynamics of California black oak (Quercus
   kelloggii Newb.) following repeated wildfires in the Lassen National
   Forest, California. We found that following reburn, changes in oak
   relative stand dominance, as well as oak sprout basal area and height,
   were each positively related to fire severity (P < 0.0001 for each
   analysis). While conifer regeneration suffered complete mortality at
   moderate and high reburn severities, 97\% of topkilled oaks resprouted
   from surviving rootstocks, reinforcing oak dominance. Black oak
   resprouts that originated following topkill in the first wildfire were
   frequently topkilled in the second fire, including at lower burn
   severities survived by advance conifer regeneration. The results of this
   study indicate that while as individuals, black oaks are resilient to
   recurring wildfire, restoration of historic woodland structure and
   function is an unlikely outcome of these repeated disturbances.
   Management of post-wildfire regenerating oak stands in this region will

Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a major natural disturbance factor in boreal forests, and the
   frequency of forest fires is predicted to increase due to climate
   change. Nitrogen (N) is a key determinant of carbon sequestration in
   boreal forests because the shortage of N limits tree growth. We studied
   changes in N pools and fluxes, and the overall N balance across a
   155-year non stand replacing fire chronosequence in sub-arctic Pinus
   sylvestris forests in Finland. Two years after the fire, total ecosystem
   N pool was 622 kg ha(-1) of which 16\% was in the vegetation, 8\% in the
   dead biomass and 76\% in the soil. 155 years after the fire, total N
   pool was 960 kg ha(-1), with 27\% in the vegetation, 3\% in the dead
   biomass and 69\% in the soil. This implies an annual accumulation rate
   of 2.28 kg ha(-1) which was distributed equally between soil and
   biomass. The observed changes in N pools were consistent with the
   computed N balance +2.11 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the 155-year post-fire
   period. Nitrogen deposition was an important component of the N balance.
   The biological N fixation increased with succession and constituted 9\%
   of the total N input during the 155 post-fire years. N2O fluxes were
   negligible (< 0.01 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and did not differ among post-fire
   age classes. The number and intensity of microbial genes involved in N
   cycling were lower at the site 60 years after fire compared to the
   youngest and the oldest sites indicating potential differences in soil N
   cycling processes. The results suggest that in sub-arctic pine forests,
   the non-stand-replacing, intermediate severity fires decrease
   considerably N pools in biomass but changes in soil and total ecosystem
   N pools are slight. Current fire-return interval does not seem to pose a
   great threat to ecosystem productivity and N status in these sub-arctic
   forests.}},

   Basin flora}},
Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{244-250}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Natural and anthropogenic fires have historically been part of the
   Mediterranean Basin (MB). As a result of this long exposure to fires, MB
   flora has developed various strategies to persist under recurrent fires.
   One of these strategies is to survive and regenerate by resprouting and
   another is through post-fire seedling recruitment. For species that
   recruit seedlings after a fire there is evidence that fire-related
   germination cues are implicated in the process of triggering seedling
   emergence from soil-stored seeds. In some species, particularly in
   Cistaceae and Fabaceae, germination is stimulated by heat. Fire-related
   chemical germination cues, such as smoke, charcoal, and nitrogenous
   compounds (collectively termed `smoke'), have also been recognised as
   promoting seed germination in MB flora. However, the role of smoke in
   the germination of MB plant species has received less attention and
   recognition than the role of heat-shock and is generally seen as having
   a relatively limited role as a post-fire germination cue in MB flora.
   Our hypothesis is that this is due to the fact that research on
   smoke-stimulated germination in the MB region has been limited and
   poorly addressed, and this is biasing our view on the role of smoke in
   MB flora. Using available literature, we first analyse the role of smoke
   in the germination of MB flora and discuss some of the issues that limit
   our understanding of its role on the flora of the region. We point to
   gaps in the literature and provide suggestions for further research.
   We conclude that differences in evidence of smoke-stimulated germination
   in MB flora when compared with other Mediterranean regions may not
   reflect real ecological or evolutionary differences among these regions
   but are likely the consequence of the limited number of well-designed
   studies in the MB. (c) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Changing disturbance-climate interactions will drive shifts in plant
   communities: these effects are not adequately quantified by
   environmental niche models used to predict future species distributions.
   We quantified the effects of more frequent fire and lower rainfall - as
   projected to occur under a warming and drying climate - on population
   responses of shrub species in biodiverse Mediterranean-climate type
   shrublands near Eneabba, southwestern Australia. Using experimental
   fires, we measured the density of all shrub species for four dominant
   plant functional groups (resprouter/non-sprouterxserotinous/soil seed
   bank) before and after fire in 33 shrubland sites, covering four
   post-fire rainfall years and fire intervals from 3-24years. Generalized
   linear mixed effects models were used to test our a priori hypotheses of
   rainfall, fire interval and plant functional type effects on post-fire
   survival and recruitment. At shortened fire intervals, species solely
   dependent on seedling recruitment for persistence were more vulnerable
   to local extinction than were species with both seedling recruitment and
   vegetative regrowth. Nevertheless, seedling recruitment was essential
   for population maintenance of resprouting species. Serotinous species
   were less resilient than soil seed storage species regardless of
   regeneration mode. Critically, in relation to changing climate, a 20\%
   reduction in post-fire winter rainfall (essential for seedling
   recruitment) is predicted to increase the minimum inter-fire interval
   required for self-replacement by 50\%, placing many species at risk of
   decline.Synthesis. Our results highlight the potentially deleterious
   biodiversity impacts of climate and fire regime change, and underscore
   weaknesses inherent in studies considering single impact factors in
   isolation. In fire-prone ecosystems characterized by a projected warming
   and drying climate, and increasing fire hazard, adaptive approaches to
   fire management may need to include heightened wildfire suppression and
   lengthened intervals for prescribed fire to best support the in situ
   persistence of perennial plant species and of plant biodiversity. This
   conclusion is at odds with the view that more managed fire may be needed
   to mitigate wildfire risk as climate warms.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested whether variations in soil burn severity (soil organic
   layer consumption) influenced patterns of early postfire plant
   regeneration in a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forest in
   interior Alaska. Variations in burn severity were related to
   measurements of postfire tree seedling establishment and cover of plant
   growth forms observed 7-8 years after fire. Black spruce and trembling
   aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) showed significant and opposite
   responses of seedling density to changes in soil burn severity. Positive
   correlations between burn severity and aspen density and individual
   seedling biomass led to an increase of over three orders of magnitude in
   aspen standing biomass (aboveground, g/m(2)) from the least to most
   severely burned sites. Variations in aspen productivity and consequent
   effects on litter production and seedbed quality possibly explain the
   observed negative response of black spruce density to increasing burn
   severity. Variations in the cover of several plant growth forms were
   also strongly correlated with patterns of soil burn severity.
   Regenerating plant communities in low-severity sites had a greater cover
   of evergreen shrubs and graminoids, while high-severity sites had
   increased cover of aspen and acro carp ous mosses. Observations of
   regeneration patterns in the burn are largely consistent with
   experimental studies of severity effects and suggest that variations in
   soil burn severity can have a strong influence on landscape patterns of
   postfire forest recovery. In this case, increases in burn severity have
   shifted successional trajectories away from simple conifer
   self-replacement towards a trajectory of mixed conifer and deciduous

Abstract = {{Forest fires affect on tree stands during combustion and for a long
   period after a fire. The work objective is an assessment and monitoring
   of the transformation of stand phytomass under the impact of large-scale
   experimental forest fires of varying intensity in pine and larch forests
   of the Lower Angara region, Krasnoyarsk Krai. Stand phytomass is
   estimated by the enumeration survey method of the model trees according
   to the diameter classes. A five-years monitoring of stand phytomass
   changes after fires of varying intensity has been carried out. A link of
   pine and larch phytomass and their individual fractions with
   morphological features and the tree age has been revealed. Up to 90 \%
   of tree mortality happens in the first 2-3 years after a fire. The close
   link between the fire intensity and the amount of post-fire tree
   mortality is established. 3 years later after a fire of high intensity
   in the pine forest the tree mortality reached 62 \%, after the middle
   and low intensity fires - 22 and 17 \% respectively of the total number
   of trees. The mortality of the first layer trees in the larch stands
   after the fire of high intensity was 49 \%, after the middle and low
   intensity fires - 35 and 20 \% respectively. The mortality of the second
   layer trees in the larch stands varied from 18 ... 34 \% after the low
   intensity fires, and reached up to 62 \% and 100 \% after the middle and
   high intensity fires, respectively. The phytomass of living trees
   decreased after the fires by 16 ... 62 \% in the pine stands and by 15
   ... 50 \% in the larch forests depending on the fire intensity. The
   post-fire dynamics of the aboveground stand phytomass in the pine and
   larch forests was determined by the fire intensity. The fires contribute
   to the phytomass redistribution of living trees into mortmass that
   increases as a result of the tree mortality, needle litter and
   cladoptosis from the trees damaged by fires.}},

Abstract = {{Existing fire policy encourages the maintenance of ecosystem integrity
   in fire management, yet this is difficult to implement on lands managed
   for competing economic, human safety, and air quality concerns. We
   discuss a fire management approach in the mid-elevations of the Sierra
   Nevada, California, USA, that may exemplify similar challenges in other
   fire-adapted regions of the western USA. We also discuss how managing
   for pyrodiversity through mixed-severity fires can promote ecosystem
   integrity in Sierran mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   Laws) forests. To illustrate, we show how coarse-filter
   (landscape-level) and complementary fine-filter (species-level)
   approaches can enhance forest management and conservation biology
   objectives as related to wildfire management. At the coarse-filter
   level, pyrodiverse mixed-severity fires provide landscape heterogeneity.
   Species and ecosystem characteristics associated with pyrodiversity can
   be maintained or enhanced by accommodating moderately severe fires,
   which hasten restoration by recreating a complex vegetation mosaic
   otherwise at risk from suppression. At the fine-filter level, managers
   can select focal species and species of conservation concern based on
   the degree to which those species depend on fire and accommodate their
   specific conservation needs. The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus {[}Swainson, 1832]) is an ideal focal species for monitoring
   the ecological integrity of forests restored through mixed-severity
   fire, and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis
   {[}Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) is a species of conservation concern that
   uses post-fire habitat mosaics and is particularly vulnerable to
   logging. We suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates wildland
   fire for ecosystem integrity and species viability with strategic
   deployment of fire suppression and ecologically based restoration of
   pyrodiverse landscapes. Our approach would accomplish fire management
   goals while simultaneously maintaining biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Risk of post-fire metal mobilization into surface water resources: A
   review}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{599}},
Pages = {{1740-1755}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{One of the significant economic benefits to communities around the world
   of having pristine forest catchments is the supply of substantial
   quantities of high quality potable water. This supports a saving of
   around US\$ 4.1 trillion per year globally by limiting the cost of
   expensive drinking water treatments and provision of unnecessary
   infrastructure. Even low levels of contaminants specifically organics
   and metals in catchments when in a mobile state can reduce these
   economic benefits by seriously affecting the water quality.
   Contamination and contaminant mobility can occur through natural and
   anthropogenic activities including forest fires. Moderate to high
   intensity forest fires are able to alter soil properties and release
   sequestered metals from sediments, soil organic matter and fragments of
   vegetation. In addition, the increase in post-fire erosion rate by
   rainfall runoff and strong winds facilitates the rapid transport of
   these metals downslope and downstream. The subsequent metal deposition
   in distal soil and water bodies can influence surface water quality with
   potential impacts to the larger ecosystems inclusive of negative effects
   on humans. This is of substantial concern as 4 billion hectares of
   forest catchments provide high quality water to global communities.
   Redressing this problem requires quantification of the potential effects
   on water resources and instituting rigorous fire and environmental
   management plans to mitigate deleterious effects on catchment areas.
   This paper is a review of the current state of,the art literature
   dealing with the risk of post-fire mobilization of the metals into
   surface water resources. It is intended to inform discussion on the
   preparation of suitable management plans and policies during and after
   fire events in order to maintain potable water quality in a
   cost-effective manner. In these times of climate fluctuation and
   increased incidence of fires, the need for development of new policies
   and management frameworks are of heighted significance. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Restoration efforts to improve vigor of large, old trees and decrease
   risk to high-intensity wildland fire and drought-mediated insect
   mortality often include reductions in stand density. We examined 15-year
   growth response of old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine
   (Pinus jeffreyi) trees in northeastern California, U.S.A. to two levels
   of thinning treatments compared to an untreated (control) area. Density
   reductions involved radial thinning (thinning 9.1 m around individual
   trees) and stand thinning. Annual tree growth in the stand thinning
   increased immediately following treatment and was sustained over the 15
   years. In contrast, radial thinning did not increase growth, but slowed
   decline compared to control trees. Available soil moisture was higher in
   the stand thinning than the control for 5 years post-treatment and
   likely extended seasonal tree growth. Our results show that large, old
   trees can respond to restoration thinning treatments, but that the level
   of thinning impacts this response. Stand thinning must be sufficiently
   intensive to improve old tree growth and health, in part due to
   increasing available soil moisture. Importantly, focusing stand density
   reductions around the immediate neighborhood of legacy trees was
   insufficient to elicit a growth response, calling into question
   treatments attempting to increase vigor of legacy trees while still
   maintaining closed canopies in dry, coniferous forest types. Although
   radial thinning did not affect tree growth rates, this treatment may
   still achieve other resource objectives not studied here, such as
   protecting wildlife habitat, reducing the risk of severe fire injury,
   and decreasing susceptibility to bark beetle attacks.}},

Volume = {{457}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Pinus merkusii (Jungh. \& de Vriese), the only pine species native to
   Indonesia, is threatened by land-use change, resource extraction, and
   fire. P. merkusii forests in Sumatra are subject to mixed-severity
   wildfires that can change forest structure over time. This project is
   only the second study to quantify differences between burned and
   unburned P. merkusii forests in Sumatra. We measured six burned-unburned
   paired sites for forest characteristics, regeneration, forest floor and
   woody debris, and effects of resin tapping. Fires killed more than 60\%
   of P. rnerkusii trees and reduced tree biomass and carbon by about 40\%.
   Fire killed trees of all sizes up to 60 cm diameter at breast height
   (DBH), but preferentially killed small trees with DBH less than 10 cm.
   Seedling regeneration of P. merkusll in the burned forest was higher on
   average than in the unburned forest, but the difference was not
   statistically significantly different and P. merkusii regeneration was
   low overall. Unlike continental Asian P. merkusii forests, the insular
   populations did not have a seedling grass stage or evidence of
   firestimulated germination. Forest floor and woody debris values were
   relatively low by the standards of global pine forests but comparable
   data do not exist for Indonesia. Recent tapping of trees for P. merkusii
   resin affected most trees over 20 cm DBH and was associated with high
   mortality in fires, suggesting that the interaction between resin
   tapping and fire could be lethal. Further research is needed to evaluate
   longer-term forest dynamics, especially for regeneration and the effects
   of resin tapping.}},

Abstract = {{Given that resource managers rely on computer simulation models when it
   is difficult or expensive to obtain vital information directly, it is
   important to evaluate how well a particular model satisfies applications
   for which it is designed. The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is used
   widely for forest management in the US, and its scope and complexity
   continue to increase. This paper focuses on the accuracy of estimates
   made by the Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE-FVS) predictions through
   comparisons between model outputs and measured post-fire conditions for
   the Cold Springs wildfire and on the sensitivity of model outputs to
   weather, disease, and fuel inputs. For each set of projected, pre-fire
   stand conditions, a fire was simulated that approximated the actual
   conditions of the Cold Springs wildfire as recorded by local portable
   weather stations. We also simulated a fire using model default values.
   From the simulated post-fire conditions, values of tree mortality and
   fuel loads were obtained for comparison to post-fire, observed values.
   We designed eight scenarios to evaluate how model output changed with
   varying input values for three parameter sets of interest: fire weather,
   disease, and fuels. All of the tested model outputs displayed some
   sensitivity to alternative model inputs. Our results indicate that tree
   mortality and fuels were most sensitive to whether actual or default
   weather was used and least sensitive to whether or not disease data were
   included as model inputs. The performance of FFE-FVS for estimating
   total surface fuels was better for the scenarios using actual weather
   data than for the scenarios using default weather data. It was rare that
   the model could predict fine fuels or litter. Our results suggest that
   using site-specific information over model default values could
   significantly improve the accuracy of simulated values. Published by

Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{179-189}},
Abstract = {{The literature on fire-stimulated flowering is reviewed in terms of
   post-fire flowering patterns, proximal ultimate factors that affect
   flowering of plants post-fire, as well as application of evolutionary
   theory and development of evolutionary models in relation to
   fire-stimulated flowering. Consideration is given to the concepts
   involved, available empirical information, and areas that warrant
   further research. Understanding the factors responsible for
   fire-stimulated flowering is limited. Studies suggest factors involved,
   but confounding of variables prevents their separation. Experiments
   evaluate different factors, but there have been few such studies and
   little consideration regarding soil attributes, synergistic effects of
   multiple factors, and large-scale factors such as herbivory, florivory,
   seed dispersal, and pollination. Understanding the adaptive nature, and
   hence evolution, of fire-stimulated flowering is poor. Prevalence of
   particular fire-related responses has been related to geographical and
   other patterns, with deduction of adaptive nature of plant responses to
   fire and factors driving evolution of these responses. However,
   confounding of factors hinders this approach and can lead to
   disagreement between researchers. A better approach would be to
   hypothesize that evolution has resulted in plant responses to fire that
   are Evolutionarily Stable Strategies and to develop consequent
   mathematical models for such evolution, leading to predictions and
   tests. However, this approach requires quantitative assessment of
   responses to fire-related factors and influences of such responses on
   plant fitness, and so far few such assessments exist. This poor state of
   knowledge regarding plants with fire-stimulated flowering means that we
   cannot easily replace or enhance fire for managing species with
   fire-stimulated flowering, as sometimes necessary, and it also restricts
   their commercial cultivation. Experimental evaluation of plant responses
   to fire and development of evolutionary models is required. Our
   knowledge of the factors that trigger post-fire flowering by
   re-sprouting plant species remains poor, and so we cannot incorporate
   relationships between them and plant fitness into mathematical models of
   plant evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Postfire vegetation development was studied at two recent mountaintop

   collected included pre- and postfire heights and densities of shrubs and
   trees, and cover of all taxa. Slopes of different aspect and altitude
   were sampled at each site to evaluate the effects of varying physical
   environment on regeneration. Rapid vegetative regeneration was common
   among shrubs and bamboo, with most taxa surviving fire. Regeneration and
   postfire colonization rates varied among species, and appeared to depend
   both on physical variables associated with different slopes, aspects and
   altitudes, and biotic variables. Most plant species in the campos de
   altitude show some form of evolutionary adaptation to fire. The

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   How species respond to climate change at local scales will depend on how
   edaphic and biological characteristics interact with species
   physiological limits and traits such as dispersal. Obligate seeders,
   those species that depend on fire for recruitment, have few and episodic
   opportunities to track a changing climate envelope. In such cases,
   long-distance seed dispersal will be necessary to take advantage of rare
   recruitment opportunities. We examine recruitment patterns and seedling
   growth below, at and above the timberline of an obligate-seeding
   Australian montane forest tree (Eucalyptus delegatensis) after
   stand-replacing fire, and place these changes in the context of regional
   warming.
   Methods
   We use two methods to detect whether E. delegatensis can establish and
   persist above the timberline after stand-replacing wildfire in montane
   forests in south-east Australia. First, we examine establishment
   patterns by using belt transects at six sites to quantify how changes in
   post-fire recruit density with increasing distance above the timberline
   seven years post-fire. Second, to determine whether dispersal or
   physiological constraints determine post-fire establishment patterns, we
   transplanted seedlings and saplings into bare ground above (100 m
   elevation), at, and below (50 m elevation) timberline 18-months after
   fire. We monitored seedling growth and survival for one growing season.
   Important Findings
   There was minimal upslope migration of the species after fire with most
   saplings observed near seed-bearing timberline trees, with only
   occasional outpost saplings. Transplanted seedlings and saplings
   survived equally well across one growing season when planted above
   existing timberlines, relative to saplings at or below the timberline.
   Seedling and sapling growth rates also did not differ across these
   location, although seedlings grew at much faster rates than saplings.
   These findings suggest that upslope growing season conditions are
   unlikely to limit initial range expansion of trees after fire. Instead,
   it is more likely that seed traits governing dispersal modulate
   responses to environmental gradients, and global change more generally.}},

Abstract = {{High concentration of heavy metals in organic soils may be the result of
   intensive, deep-seated fires causing high temperatures. This research
   has been carried in four post-fire areas, located in forests or on
   meadows in Lower Silesia. The aim has been to determine the impact of
   some parameters on the content of heavy metals in soils under postfire
   meadows and forests. The concentration and pool of the analyzed heavy
   metals were determined in soils against the background of such
   parameters as the depth in a horizon, organic matter content, soil
   colour and soil reaction. Twenty Histosol soil profiles (85 soil
   samples) were analyzed, representing peat-muck, muck (MtIIc1, MtIIIc1)
   and mineral-mucky (Me11) and on-muck soils (according to the Polish
   taxonomy of soils). The soils were strongly desiccated. Some
   physicochemical and chemical properties of pyrogenic soils were analyzed
   in dry samples collected into plastic bags with an Instorfu auger. Heavy
   metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr) were determined in HCI + HNO3. Pools of
   heavy metals were recalculated into g m(-2) in 0-20 cm layers of soils
   and compared among forest and meadow soils. Due to intensive fires, the
   reaction of pyrogenic soils was slightly acid, neutral or alkaline. As a
   consequence of the high temperatures, a broad spectrum of soil colours
   was noticed. The results showed increased concentrations of heavy metals
   in the topmost and muddy soil horizons. The alkaline soil reaction
   favoured accumulation of heavy metals. Pools of heavy metals in soils
   were significantly lower in forest than in meadow areas, which could be
   attributed to different time periods which elapsed since the fires. The
   Hue tint of the colour of soil horizons containing ashes indicated the
   presence of oxidized iron forms and a low content of organic carbon. The
   accumulation of heavy metals in post-fire sites in Lower Silesia was
   negatively correlated with the soil's strongly acid reaction. The
   determined concentrations of heavy metals did not exceed the threshold
   values set for unpolluted soils.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires may play a role in redistributing radionuclides in the
   environment in combination with hydrological processes such as surface
   runoff and soil erosion. We investigated plot-scale radionuclide
   wash-off at forest sites affected by wildfires in the Chernobyl
   Exclusion Zone (CEZ). We also compared speciation of the washed-off
   radionuclides with those in previous studies conducted just after the
   accident in 1986. We observed the surface runoff and the radionuclide
   wash-off with a soil erosion plot at forest and post-fire sites during
   May-September 2018. In the post-fire site, 2.81 mm of surface runoff was
   observed in at least three flow events resulting from 285.8 mm total
   rainfall. The fluxes of dissolved and particulate Cs-137 were estimated
   as 4.9 and 161 Bq m(-2), respectively. The dissolved phase Sr-9(0) flux
   was estimated as 214 Bq m(-2). At the forest site, a single surface
   runoff (0.67 mm) event was generated by rainfall of 182.2 mm. The fluxes
   of dissolved and particulate Cs-137 wash-off values were 6.2 and 8.6 Bq
   m(-2), respectively. The flux of dissolved Sr-90 wash-off from the
   forest was estimated as 45.1 Bq m(-2). The distribution coefficient,
   which indicates the dissolved-particulate form of radionuclides, in the
   post-fire site was 30 times higher than that in the forest site,
   indicating the importance of particulate Cs-137 wash-off after fire in
   the CEZ. The entrainment coefficients for dissolved and particulate
   Cs-137 concentrations were around 50 times lower than those obtained in
   the corresponding position within the CEZ immediately after the accident

Abstract = {{The area burned by wildfire in the states of Arizona and New Mexico in
   the southwestern US has been increasing in recent years. In many cases,
   high severity bums have caused dramatic increases in runoff and sediment
   yield from burned watersheds. This paper describes the potential and
   limitations of the HEC6T sediment transport model to describe changes in
   channel scour and deposition following the Cerro Grande fire near Los
   Alamos, New Mexico. Following the fire, Pueblo Canyon, near Los Alamos,
   was subject to a peak flow two orders of magnitudes higher than any
   discharge in the 7-year period of record, and twice the initial
   post-fire estimate of the 100-year event. HEC6T requires that the limits
   of scour and deposition on a cross-section be specified prior to
   application. This was achieved by using geomorphologic principles,
   predicted post-bum hydrology and long-term estimates of channel change
   derived from air photos, to estimate post-fire channel widths. Because
   significant quantities of silt and clay were present in the runoff,
   erosion shear stress and erosion rate parameters for cohesive sediments
   had to be obtained experimentally. After a sensitivity analysis, an
   optimization routine was used to estimate the optimal model parameter
   values for sensitive parameters. HEC6T was able to accurately model the
   change in cumulative sediment volume change derived from Airborne Laser
   Swath Mapping (ALSM, often called Lidar) taken before and after the
   large post-fire event. One discrepancy between the HEC6T model
   prediction and the ALSM-estimated change was that the ALSM-estimated
   change showed the greatest amount of deposition in a portion of the
   canyon with increasing slope, which the HEC6T model did not predict.Any
   sediment transport model will predict increased sediment transport
   capacity with increasing energy slope, so that it was considered to be
   beyond the capability of any sediment transport model to predict this
   deposition. Therefore, HEC6T simulated the overall changes in scour and
   deposition within reasonable expectation of the capabilities of
   physically-based sediment transport modeling indicating that it is
   capable of modeling sediment transport in ephemeral channels following
   wildfire. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Questions In many arid and semi-arid regions of the world, livestock
   husbandry is the main land use and grazing is one of the main challenges
   for biodiversity conservation. This also applies to the Caatinga, a
   unique seasonally dry tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. It is
   considered one of the most threatened ecosystems of Brazil. To protect
   semi-arid regions from biodiversity loss, degradation, and
   desertification, sustainable management practices are urgently needed.
   However, the effect of different grazing intensities on plant diversity
   is not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined the effect of
   different grazing intensities on plant species composition, alpha and
   beta diversity. Location Vicinity of the Itaparica Reservoir,
   northeastern Brazil. Methods We assessed the effects of different
   grazing intensities (high, intermediate, no/low) on species composition,
   alpha and beta diversity of the tree and shrub, and the herb layer in a
   Caatinga area. Plant diversity of the tree and shrub layer was assessed
   on 45 study plots (each 20 m x 20 m), while the diversity of herbs was
   studied on a subset of 36 plots (four subplots, each 2 m x 2 m). Results
   In total, we recorded 140 plant taxa including morphospecies. Grazing at
   high intensities significantly reduced almost all measures of alpha and
   beta diversity (tree and shrub layer) compared to areas with no or low
   grazing. In contrast, species composition was not significantly related
   to grazing but instead to altitude, which serves as an indicator of
   reduced anthropogenic impact such as slash-and-burn agriculture or tree
   harvesting. Conclusion Overall, the study results show that the current
   livestock management has negative effects on plant diversity in Caatinga
   ecosystems. These results have been incorporated into guidelines
   provided to regional stakeholders including recommendations for adapted
   land-management practices that protect and foster the biodiversity of
   dry forests while sustaining local livelihoods.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest birds have adapted to changes caused by natural
   disturbances such as fire and this adaptation forms the basis for the
   Natural Disturbance Paradigm (NDP) underlying recent proposed changes in
   forest harvesting practices in western Canada. To date, this paradigm
   has been evaluated primarily at the stand level and within conventional
   harvesting systems. The potential for improvements in avian conservation
   at the landscape scale by adopting the NDP approach is largely unknown.
   We examined the effects of landscape-scale disturbances on forest bird
   communities by contrasting richness and abundance of birds in (1) 16
   single-pass harvest sites with residual forest patches, (2) 29
   multi-pass harvest sites with residuals; and (3) 15 salvage-logged
   post-fire sites with variable harvest intensity. We contrasted bird
   communities in these treatments with those in unsalvaged post-fire sites
   of similar age. Post-fire sites were used to provide a metric of the
   Natural Range of Variation (NRV) to be expected in bird communities.
   Sites were surveyed for avian community composition and abundance 1-5
   years post-disturbance. Redundancy analysis indicated that bird
   communities differed from the NRV in all of the harvest treatments.
   However, single-pass harvests provided a somewhat better fit to NRV than
   did multipass harvesting. Avian community similarity was influenced by
   non-linear responses to area harvested, amount of residual retention,
   residual composition and pre-disturbance forest composition. An
   optimization routine created from a General Linear Model, suggests that
   community similarity to NRV can be maximized by using single-pass
   harvests over multi-pass harvests, harvesting 66-88\% of the timber in
   the planning unit, and retaining 5-19\% of the disturbance area as live
   residual patches, with 50\% of harvests having at least 9\% of the area
   in residuals. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Frequently burned low-latitude coniferous forests maintain a
   high-diversity understory. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests
   and woodlands have exceptionally high diversity at fine scales and very
   frequent fire return intervals (1-3 yr). Furthermore, the positive
   association between high-frequency, low-intensity surface fires and high
   species richness in longleaf pine ecosystems is well documented but
   poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated additional linkages
   between specific fuel assemblages and fire intensity at small spatial
   scales. In this study, we build upon both patterns by using long-term
   datasets to examine the relationship between fire and specific fuel
   types, and how the combination of these two elements contributes to
   ground cover species diversity. We used 11 yr of monitoring data from
   longleaf pine forests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida (USA), to
   parameterize a structural equation model that examines causal
   relationships between fuels and fire history on ground cover plant
   diversity. Overstory-derived fuels, including pine needle litter, pine
   cones, and other 10 and 100-h woody fuels, had the greatest positive
   impact on diversity in relatively open-canopied, frequently burned
   reference stands. A second model examined surface fuel components
   originating from the forest overstory as characterized by airborne light
   detection and ranging and found that pine needle litter was positively
   associated with canopy density. Our parameter estimates for causal
   relationships between easily measured variables and plant diversity will
   allow for the development of management models at the stand scale while
   being informed by fuels measured at the plot scale.}},

Abstract = {{Dense ponderosa pine forests in the southwestern United States inhibit
   understory production and diversity and are susceptible to high-severity
   wildfire. Restoration treatments involving overstory thinning and
   prescribed burning are being implemented to increase understory
   productivity and diversity and to reduce the risk of severe wildfire.
   However, disturbances associated with treatments may favor invasion of
   nonnative species, and the severity of the disturbance may be related to
   the level of nonnative species establishment. We examined understory
   community composition, species richness, and plant cover responses to 3
   stand-scale replicates of 4 different tree-thinning intensities.
   Restoration treatments altered the composition of the understory
   community regardless of thinning intensity. Understory richness and
   cover were highly variable among experimental blocks, but we observed
   strong trends of increasing richness and cover in the treated stands.
   Immediately following restoration treatments, nonnative species cover
   comprised 6\% of the total cover where treatment-induced disturbances
   were the greatest. However, the initial increase in nonnative species
   did not persist and was reduced by half 6 years after treatment. Plant
   community composition was still in flux by the sixth year after
   treatment, indicating that continued monitoring is necessary for
   evaluating whether restoration targets are maintained over time.}},

Abstract = {{Upland forests in the Pacific Northwest currently provide a host of

   simulation model (Envision) to evaluate potential impacts of climate
   change on the vegetation cover and the disturbance regime in the
   Willamette River Basin, Oregon. Three CMIP5 climate model scenarios,
   downscaled to a 4 km spatial resolution, were employed. In our
   simulations, the dominant potential vegetation cover type remained
   forest throughout the basin, but forest type transitioned from primarily
   evergreen needleleaf to a mixture of broadleaf and needleleaf growth
   forms adapted to a warmer climate. By 2100, there was a difference
   (i.e., climate/vegetation disequilibrium) between potential and actual
   forest type for 20-50 \% of the forested area. In the moderate to high
   climate change scenarios, the average area burned per year increased
   three to nine fold from the present day. Forest harvest on private land

   two pyrogenic flowering resprouters}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{545-557}},
Abstract = {{A few resprouting plants in fire-prone environments have no local seed
   bank (soil or canopy) when a fire occurs. These species rely on
   post-fire flowering and the production of non-dormant seeds to exploit
   favourable post-fire establishment and growth conditions. For two such
   pyrogenic flowering species (Doryanthes excelsa Correa and Telopea
   speciosissima (Smith) R. Br.), we examined the timing of seed release,
   patterns of fruit production, seed dispersal, seed predation and
   seedling establishment following a fire in the Sydney region of
   southeastern Australia. Both species took some 19 months after the fire
   to flower and the first seeds were released 2 years after the fire. D.
   excelsa flowered and fruited only once after the fire. For T.
   speciosissima, plants also flowered at least once more in the subsequent
   5 years, but produced seed in only the first three post-fire flowering
   years. Fruit production differed between species, with fruiting
   individuals of D. excelsa producing fewer infructescences, similar
   numbers of follicles, but many more seeds per follicle than fruiting
   individuals of T. speciosissima. Ultimately, D. excelsa produced
   approximately six times as many seeds per m 2 and four times as many
   seeds per adult in one flowering season than T. speciosissima did after
   four flowering (three successful fruiting) seasons.
   Seeds were passively dispersed from fruits borne 3-4 m (D. excelsa) or
   1-2 m (T. speciosissima) above the ground. Most seeds were found within
   5 m (D. excelsa) or 3 m (T. speciosissima) of parent plants. The primary
   seed shadow of both species was a poor predictor of the distribution of
   seedlings, with more seedlings occurring further from the adults than
   expected from the distribution of seeds. Seed loss to predators was high
   in both species in exclusion experiments where mammals had access to
   clumps of seeds (77-88\%). It was variable and generally lower (8-65\%)
   in experiments where seeds were not locally clumped. However, for T.
   speciosissima, at one site, some 65\% of seeds were lost to mammals and
   invertebrates in these latter experiments. At this site, these losses
   appeared to influence subsequent recruitment levels, as very low
   seedling densities were observed.
   For both species, germination of seedlings first occurred some 2.5-3
   years after the passage of the fire. The percentage of seeds produced to
   seedlings successfully established was low in D. excelsa (2-3\%) and
   more variable across sites and years in T. speciosissima (0-18\%).
   Resultant post-fire seedling densities of D. excelsa (two sites) and T.
   speciosissima at one site were similar, but they were much lower at the
   T. speciosissima site that had high levels of seed predation. Both D.
   excelsa and T. speciosissima are amongst the slowest woody resprouting
   species to recruit seedlings after fire in south-eastern Australia and
   lag years behind species with soil or canopy seed banks.}},

Abstract = {{Human-modified forested landscapes are prevalent in the tropics, and the
   role of complex mosaics of diverse vegetation types in biodiversity
   conservation remains poorly understood. Demographic traits and the
   spatial pattern of biodiversity are essential information when
   considering proper forest management and land use strategies. We
   compared the tree community structure (stem density, basal area, tree
   diversity, abundance of rare, endemic, and upper-layer trees, and
   species composition) and the forest dynamics (mortality, recruitment
   rate, and increments of basal area, and above- and below-ground biomass)
   of 39-46 plots among five dominant forest types: young and old fallows,
   rubber plantations, and fragmented and old-growth forests in Sarawak,
   Malaysia. We also explored how tree diversity was distributed across
   different spatial scales using additive partitioning of diversity.
   Swidden cultivation and rubber plantations showed decreased stem
   density, basal area, tree diversity, abundance of rare, endemic, and
   upper-layer trees, and increments of above- and below-ground biomass,
   which affected tree mortality, dominant trees, and species composition.
   Little distinction in species composition was observed among young and
   old fallows and rubber plantations, indicating a relatively quick
   recovery of the tree community in the early stages. The highest
   diversity was found among forest types, indicating that the whole
   forested landscape comprises a suitable scale for tree biodiversity
   conservation in the region. Our results suggest that although fragmented

   conserving biodiversity and sustaining the function of the forest
   ecosystem, secondary forests may also have a reinforcing role in
   maintaining tree diversity in the region, especially under the current

Abstract = {{Lower treeline limber pine woodlands have received little attention in
   peer-reviewed literature and in management strategies. These
   ecologically distinct systems are thought to be seed repositories
   between discontinuous populations in the northern and central Rocky
   Mountains, serving as seed sources for bird dispersal between distinct
   mountain ranges. Their position on the lower treeline and foothills in
   semi-arid climate systems is predicted to be particularly vulnerable to
   climate change. The genetic variation within these stands is viewed as
   important to conservation geneticists in developing seed sources
   resistant to blister rust.
   The isolated locations and different climatic conditions of these
   woodlands may have provided them some protection in the past from the
   mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosas) and white pine blister
   rust (Cronartium ribicola) that are threatening upper treeline limber
   pine forests region-wide. But, recent studies show that the lower
   treeline woodlands are just as, or more, susceptible to white pine
   blister rust infections and mountain pine beetle infestations.
   Lower treeline woodlands are often thought to be ``invading{''} more
   desirable sagebrush and grass vegetation types, so eradication via
   chaining, mastication, and burning have been accepted practices to limit
   woodland growth or ``encroachment.{''} The lack of economic value has
   led to the common perception that these lower treeline woodlands are
   ``weeds{''} which need to be controlled to prevent their expansion into
   more economically valuable grazing lands. The common perception of these
   woodlands is that they should be maintained only on steep rocky slopes
   that will not support other vegetative types. Their expansion into grass
   and shrublands is thought to be from wildland fire suppression and other
   management actions such as livestock grazing. This view does not account
   for the dynamic relationships among vegetation, climate and wildland
   fire. It also does not take into account that these are ecotones between
   biomes that move elevationally, based on the above conditions. The
   conditions and characteristics that are used for baseline vegetation
   developed during the Little Ice Age conditions from approximately 1300
   to 1900; a climatic period that was both wetter and cooler than present
   conditions. Many of the current models for the areas encompassing the
   lower treeline limber pine woodlands predict an increase in temperature
   of between 1 degrees to 7 degrees F in the summer and from 1 degrees to
   6 degrees F in the winter, which may increase the growing season
   evapo-transpiration rates. For much of the area, seasonal changes in
   precipitation are also predicted, including a summer precipitation
   decrease from 10 to 50 percent and winter precipitation increase from 10
   to 25 percent.
   Not enough is known ecologically about the lower treeline limber pine
   and its relationship to upper treeline populations and the biotic
   communities dependent upon them, to assume ``business as usual{''}
   activities and management. In order to change the management paradigms
   that exist for the lower treeline woodlands, a series of carefully
   delineated basic and applied research questions need to be formulated
   for these stands. Answering these questions will provide managers with a
   fuller understanding of the ecological role(s) of the lower treeline
   limber pine woodlands, resulting in more informed management decisions
   on the ground.}},

Abstract = {{Finding a balance between strict protection and multiple use requires
   data on wildlife survival in human-managed ecosystems. We examined the
   habitat use and species composition of mammals >2 kg in size inhabiting
   an agroforest ecosystem neighboring a park in the Peruvian Amazon.
   First, we recorded wildlife presence in fields, fallows, and forests
   within one settlement over a 9-month period. Then we monitored wildlife
   presence over 21 months in 42 fields across a 65-km transect, including
   remote and highly disturbed sites. We tested for correlations between
   the size and number of mammal species visiting fields and human
   activities measured at different scales. Hunting intensity more
   powerfully predicted the average biomass and species diversity observed
   infields than did vegetation disturbance. The number of commercial
   hunters in the surrounding community had a stronger impact than did the
   individual field owner's hunting intensity. Large-bodied species
   appeared only in remote farms neighboring uninhabited areas in the
   reserve, indicating that undisturbed forests act as sources for wildlife
   dispersing into agricultural regions. Farmers in these remote areas
   experience greater crop and livestock losses to wildlife, but by hunting
   large game they are able to offset losses with bushmeat gains. In more
   disturbed areas, crop losses exceeded bushmeat gains, although both
   occurred at negligible levels. Our case study suggests that large
   herbivores, large carnivores, and most primates are unlikely to persist
   in multiple-use zones in Amazonian forests unless hunting is effectively
   restricted. Even highly disturbed agroforests are not empty of wildlife,
   however, but are inhabited by a suite of adaptable, fast-reproducing
   species able to withstand human activity (e.g., brown agoutis
   {[}Dasyprocta variegata], armadillos {[}Dasypus novemcinetus], and red
   brocket deer {[}Mazama gauazoubira]). These ``weedy{''} species may not
   be of immediate concern to conservation biologists, and they will not
   attract tourists. But they have both economic and ecological value and
   deserve to be taken into account in management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of the ground vegetation and its energetics such
   as biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, and the nutrient
   cycling patterns in the humid tropical forest of the Western Ghats in
   India are largely determined by gap age and by whether gaps are formed
   naturally or through selection felling. Responses of plant categories
   such as herbs, shrubs, tree seedlings and saplings also vary depending
   upon gap type and age. An exotic species such as Chromolaena odorata
   occurred only in selection-felled gaps ((9+/-3)-(49+/-4) individuals
   (100 m)(-2)). Nilgirianthus ciliatus, a dominant shrub, plays a key role
   in the gaps in determining population dynamics of others. The net
   primary productivity of the ground vegetation, which is about
   31.17+/-4.26 kg (100 m)-2 year(-1) in an undisturbed site, increased a
   year after gap formation to 102.82+/-6.46 kg (100 m)-2 year(-1) in
   natural gaps and to 71.82+/-2.36 kg (100 m)(-2) year(-1) in
   selection-felled gaps. Five years after gap formation, net primary
   productivity of the ground vegetation declined considerably, this being
   related to decline in fast-growing shrub and secondary tree species in
   the vegetation and gap closure. A similar trend was also recorded for
   the rates of nutrient uptake and nutrient accumulation in the
   vegetation.
   In natural gaps the soil nutrient level increased gradually with gap
   age. This could be attributed to slow release of nutrients from the
   fallen trunks and nutrient storage in the rapidly recovering vegetation.
   In contrast, in selection-felled gaps, the quantities of soil nutrients
   such as nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium were higher in 1-year-old
   gaps than in undisturbed sites, owing to the release of these nutrients
   from leaf litter and wood debris which were deposited in larger
   quantities within the gap itself, and owing to sparse ground vegetation
   resulting from the greater disturbance of the soil, in the first 1 or 2
   years. The fractional annual turnover rates of elements of the ground
   vegetation and the soil were higher in 1-year-old gaps and declined with
   gap age. The significance of these results for forest management is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Water repellency (WR) is a common soil property in many fire-affected
   ecosystems, but it also occurs in long-unburned terrain. It can vary in
   space at different scales (between point and pedon or slope and
   catchment) and time (during the same day, between seasons or years, or
   with a post-fire recovery period). This paper: i) reports on the
   occurrence and persistence of WR in fire-affected calcareous forest
   soils under Mediterranean climatic conditions, examining its spatial
   variability at macro-, meso- and micro-scales, and monthly changes with
   soil moisture content; and ii) develops exploratory models to estimate
   the probability of the natural background (not fire-induced) WR to occur
   through a Mixed-Effect Logistic Regression Model. Four sites with
   comparable soil and vegetation types were studied, all of them burned in
   1979, the third again 1999, and the fourth in April 2008. All sites were
   sampled immediately after the fire of 2008, a further 17 times until
   July 2009, and once more in August 2011. At each site, 5 random plots
   (10 cm x 10 cm) were selected for each of the vegetation types: Pinus
   halepensis, Quercus coccifera, Rosmarinus officinalis and bare soil. In
   each plot we carried out 10 Water Drop Penetration Time measurements at
   the surface and at 1 cm depth. WR was detected in samples from all
   sites, although WR was most frequent at the soil surface at the sites
   last burnt in 1979. The recently burned site had similar WR to the
   long-unburned ones in surface but greater at 1 cm depth, although for
   both depths WR was reduced by the following year. WR was still very low
   in the site burned 10 years before. Variability of WR between different
   vegetation types was as high as within the same type at the same site,
   and similarly high at within sites (1 ha) and at 10 cm x 10 cm
   plot-scales. The lowest variability was found in bare soil plots because
   they were mostly wettable. An exploratory model to estimate the
   probability of WR occurrence was derived for each unburned site. The
   most powerful explanatory variables for the probability of WR to occur
   (P < 0.0001) for both unburned sites were the covariate moisture content
   together with the category soil surface (associated to the fixed factor
   soil depth) for one site and P. halepensis (associated to vegetation
   type) for the other. The model input parameters are straightforward to
   obtain and the model may be a useful tool in estimating occurrence and
   fluctuation of soil WR. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dry forests of Washington are becoming increasingly susceptible to
   broadscale stand replacement fire and insect and disease epidemics. In
   response, land managers implement fuel reduction strategies. These
   situations could potentially affect numerous wildlife species, including
   cavity-nesting birds. Much information exists on nesting requirements of
   cavity-nesters, while little information is available on their foraging
   requirements, or how changes to their habitat affect foraging. We
   examined short-term responses of cavity-nesting birds in dry conifer
   forests of Washington, to fuel reduction treatments in 2004 and 2005, as
   part of the National Fire-Fire Surrogate Project (FFS). Our objective
   was to determine if altering the forest stand through mechanical
   thinning or prescribed burning or a combination of the two would alter
   foraging tree selection. We used linear logistic regression and Akaike's
   Information Criteria (AIC) to model foraging tree selection and to
   analyze the effects of treatments on foraging tree selection. Model
   averaged parameter estimates suggested that cavity-nesting birds
   selected for large diameter trees and FFS treatments had a positive
   impact on foraging for nuthatches and woodpeckers. Birds were more
   likely to be observed foraging in treated stands and the positive
   relationship was strongest in stands that received a combination of
   thinning and burning treatments. Enhanced foraging conditions in the
   thin-burn treatment may have resulted from a more complete removal of
   small trees, while the prescribed burn was so low-intensity, it did not
   remove many small trees. Bird groups selected for trees at least 1.6
   times as large in diameter in treated stands as compared to control
   stands. Our results indicate activities such as thinning and burning may
   best enhance foraging habitat for bark gleaning species as a whole. Our
   data suggests that some important treatment design considerations
   include the removal of small trees and the retention of large trees and
   snags (>40 cm dbh) that provide important foraging substrate and nesting
   habitat. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Northern Colorado Plateau pinon-juniper woodland decline over the past
   century}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The vegetation of Dinosaur National Monument and surrounding lands
   (similar to 298,000 ha) was reconstructed using General Land Office
   (GLO) survey records. This historical dataset was compared to two modern
   digital datasets to determine how vegetation has changed over 90 years.
   Net declines of 3-7\% occurred in pinon-juniper woodland and 12-19\% in
   montane shrubland, along with corresponding 16-26\% increases in
   sagebrush shrublands. Shorter natural and human-caused fire rotations of
   188-216 years appear to be driving woodland contraction. Pinon-juniper
   expansion was concentrated, but not strictly confined to areas near
   historical pinon-juniper-sagebrush ecotones, and was particularly
   favored at elevations of 2000-2400 m and on slopes of 10-30\%. Shorter
   recent fire rotations in sagebrush appear linked to cheatgrass
   expansion. Fire exclusion has had no net effect on fire rotations in the
   study area, as these rotations are generally shorter, not longer than
   historical rotations. If trends continue, a landscape outside the
   historical range of variability with significantly more early seral
   sagebrush and grassland and less pinon-juniper woodland will emerge.
   Declines of pinon-juniper in the study area are similar to the recent
   loss of woodland in Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, and suggest that
   historical woodlands on the Colorado Plateau may be declining due to an
   excess of fire since Euro-American settlement. If the goal is to
   maintain and restore the integrity of the natural vegetation and
   landscape of the study area, managers could suspend further
   resource-management burning, reduce unintentional human-set fires, and
   seek direct control of cheatgrass. Spatially complex patterns of
   woodland stability, recovery, contraction, and expansion show that
   century-scale data are needed across large landscapes to discern net
   trends in landscape change needed for ecological restoration,
   management, and understanding impending future change.}},

Abstract = {{Despite inhabiting fire-adapted grasslands and shrublands across much of
   their continental distribution, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus,
   hereafter bobwhite) behavior relative to disturbance (e.g., fire) is
   poorly understood, especially in the western fringe of their
   distribution. We assessed bobwhite movement and space use following
   dormant season burning (January-March 2013-2014) in a sand shinnery oak
   (Quercus havardii, hereafter shinnery oak) plant community. We captured
   and radio-marked bobwhites (n = 369) and monitored them via
   radiotelemetry across burn treatments (averaging 254 ha) ranging from 0
   to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, and > 36 months post fire (hereafter, time
   since fire {[}TSF]) at the Packsaddle Wildlife Management Area in
   western Oklahoma, United States. Mean covey home range size was 76.6 ha
   +/- 5.9 {[}SE] (range; 12 - 270 ha) (n = 61 coveys), which is
   substantially larger than covey home ranges reported for other regions.
   Prescribed fire affected space use of coveys (F-4,F- 54 = 2.95, P <
   0.05), which was driven by smaller home range sizes of coveys using 25 -
   36 TSF (52.07 ha {[}+/- 6.6]) than 0 - 12 (85.0 ha {[}+/- 15.53]), 13 -
   24 (86.7 ha {[}+/- 20.7]) and > 36 TSF (78.9 ha {[}+/- 6.54]).
   Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that neither spring
   dispersal (movements or area traversed) were correlated with TSF, age,
   or sex (n = 114), further demonstrating a minimal effect of prescribed
   fire; however, dispersal areas were greater in 2013 than in 2014 (P <
   0.05). Our research shows that prescribed fire applied at a landscape
   scale had limited effects on short-term bobwhite movement and space use.
   These findings also suggest that in shinnery oak vegetation communities
   land managers can use prescribed fire across large spatial extents
   without substantially altering the space use or movement of bobwhites.

Abstract = {{Plant-microbial feedbacks are important drivers of plant community
   structure and dynamics. These feedbacks are driven by the variable
   modification of soil microbial communities by different plant species.
   However, other factors besides plant species can influence soil
   communities and potentially interact with plant-microbial feedbacks. We
   tested for plant-microbial feedbacks in two Eucalyptus species, E.
   globulus and E. obliqua, and the influence of forest fire on these
   feedbacks. We collected soils from beneath mature trees of both species
   within native forest stands on the Forestier Peninsula, Tasmania,
   Australia, that had or had not been burnt by a recent forest fire. These
   soils were subsequently used to inoculate seedlings of both species in a
   glasshouse experiment. We hypothesized that (i) eucalypt seedlings would
   respond differently to inoculation with conspecific versus
   heterospecific soils (i.e., exhibit plant-microbial feedbacks) and (ii)
   these feedbacks would be removed by forest fire. For each species,
   linear mixed effects models tested for differences in seedling survival
   and biomass in response to inoculation with conspecific versus
   heterospecific soils that had been collected from either unburnt or
   burnt stands. Eucalyptus globulus displayed a response consistent with a
   positive plant-microbial feedback, where seedlings performed better when
   inoculated with conspecific versus heterospecific soils. However, this
   effect was only present when seedlings were inoculated with unburnt
   soils, suggesting that fire removed the positive effect of E. globulus
   inoculum. These findings show that external environmental factors can
   interact with plant-microbial feedbacks, with possible implications for
   plant community structure and dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire conducted in fire-prone areas is a cost-effective choice
   for forest management, but it also affects many of the physicochemical
   and bio-geological properties of the forest soil, in a similar manner to
   wild fires. The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of the
   mercury mobilization after a prescribed fire and the subsequent temporal
   changes in concentration. A prescribed fire was conducted in a legacy
   mine site in Central Victoria, Australia, in late August 2015 and soil
   sample collection and analyses were carried out two days before and two
   days after the fire, followed by collection at the end of each season
   and after an intense rainfall event in September 2016. Results revealed
   the occurrence of mercury volatilization (83-97\%) during the fire, and
   the mercury concentration displayed a significant difference (p < 0.05)
   before and immediately after the fire. Integrated assessment with number
   of pollution indices has shown that the study site is extremely
   contaminated with mercury during all the sampling events, and this poses
   a serious ecological risk due to the health impacts of mercury on human
   and ecosystems. In times of climate fluctuation with concomitant
   increase in forest fire (including prescribed fire), and subsequent
   precipitation and runoff, the potential for an increased amount of
   mercury being mobilized is of heighted significance. Therefore, it is
   recommended that prescribed fire should be cautiously considered as a
   forest management strategy in any mercury affected landscapes. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{We surveyed postfire vegetation at five sites at high elevations (> 2000
   m) in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. Highlands of the
   Cordillera Central are dominated by a single pine species, Pinus
   occidentalis, but plant communities are rich with endemics and
   conservation and fire management efforts in these systems are ongoing.
   The burns were 2-7 yr in age and had consumed nearly all shrub crowns.
   Pines suffered high mortality (> 50\%, all sites combined), but shrubs
   resprouted at high rates (88\%, N = 957) after fire. All shrub taxa
   produced basal resprouts; eight of 11 shrub taxa measured had
   resprouting rates > 90 percent, while Baccharis myrsinites had the
   lowest (56\%). Most taxa grew to prefire height quickly (within 5-7 yr),
   with regrowth of stem diameters lagging behind. Patterns and rates of
   shrub recovery resembled those documented in high elevation shrublands
   in Costa Rica and Brazil. Pinus occidentalis does not resprout, but
   larger individuals can survive fire. Survival increases dramatically
   when trees attain > 13-cm dbh, when bark becomes thick enough to protect
   cambial tissue. Overall, pines are regenerating much more slowly than
   shrubs, but seedling establishment varied considerably between sites.
   Frequent fires may cause a decline in pines and an increase in shrub- or
   grass-dominated communities. Succession in these high elevation
   fire-dependent pine forests favors taxa already present in the preburn
   vegetation, with woody composition changing little after fire, in
   contrast to lower-elevation cloud forest, where postfire vegetation has
   been shown to bear little resemblance to mature forest even after
   several years.}},

   resource selection is essential to assist in habitat management for a
   species' conservation, particularly for species with narrow resource
   width. This study aimed to assess whether microhabitat variables affect
   the selection of Eucalyptus resinifera sap feed trees by yellow-bellied
   gliders (Petaurus australis) in north-eastern Australia. Microhabitat
   variables were measured in a simplified way around glider-selected and -
   non-selected Eucalyptus resinifera trees. Canopy cover and percentage of
   burnt trunk below breast height were identified as influential on feed
   tree selection, with feed trees showing a higher percentage of burnt
   trunk and a lower surrounding canopy cover. While the direct effect of
   fire on a potential feed tree remains to be clarified, fire may affect
   the structural composition of vegetation leading to lower surrounding
   canopy cover around potential feed trees. Thus, any forest management,
   such as logging and grazing should be practiced with great caution since
   they affect structural features of the vegetation that may contribute to
   the selection of feed trees by this species and may also affect its
   alternative food resources.}},

Abstract = {{The number of large, high-severity fires has increased in the western
   United States over the past 30 years due to climate change and
   increasing tree density from fire suppression. Fuel quantity,
   topography, and weather during a burn control fire severity, and the
   relative contributions of these controls in mixed-severity fires in
   mountainous terrain are poorly understood. In 2013, the Rim Fire burned
   a previously studied 2125 ha area of mixed-conifer forest in Yosemite
   National Park. Data from 84 plots sampled in 2002 revealed increases in
   tree density, basal area, and fuel buildup since 1899 due to fire
   exclusion. A dendroecological fire history and reconstruction of forest
   structure in 1899 showed that this area historically experienced
   frequent, low-severity fire. In contrast with this region's historical
   fire regime, burn severity from Landsat imagery showed that this area
   burned at mixed-severity in the Rim Fire, with 13\% of plots classified
   as unchanged, 31\% low severity, 32\% moderate severity, and 24\% high
   severity. A random forest model was used to identify the controls of
   fire severity in this portion of the Rim Fire, using daily area burned,
   daily fire weather, and fuels and vegetation data for the surface and
   canopy. Topography, tree species composition, and cover of forbs and
   shrubs best explained the fire severity. As an example of a re-entry
   burn, this study demonstrates how fire exclusion alters fire-vegetation
   interactions, leading to uncharacteristically severe burns and
   potentially new fire-vegetation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Northern peatlands are experiencing increased wildfire disturbance,
   threatening peatland biogeochemical function and ability to remain major
   stores of carbon (C) and macronutrients (nitrogen-N, and phosphorus-P).
   The impacts of climate change-driven drying on peatland nutrient
   dynamics have been explored previously; however, the impacts of wildfire
   on nutrient dynamics have not been examined when comparing burned and
   unburned areas in a post-fire fen. This study assessed the impact of
   wildfire on N and P bioavailability, change in CNP stoichiometric
   balance and feedback on plant nutrient limitation patterns in a fen
   peatland, one-year post-wildfire, by comparing Burned and Unburned
   areas. Water extractable P increased up to 200 times in shallow
   leachate, 125 times in groundwater and 5 times in peat. Surface ash
   leachate had increased concentrations in Ammonium (NH4+) and Nitrate
   (NO3-), and through groundwater mobility, increased extractable N
   concentrations were observed in peat throughout the entire fen. The net
   mineralization of N and P were minimal at the Burned areas relative to
   Unburned areas. Fire affected plant nutrient limitation patterns,
   switching from dominantly N-limited to NP co-limited and P-limitation in
   moss and vascular species respectively. The top 20 cm of the Burned area
   C concentrations was higher relative to the Unburned area, with
   increased CN and CP ratios also being found in the Burned area. These
   findings suggest that the long-term effects of elevated C, N, and P
   concentrations on plant productivity and decomposition must be
   re-evaluated for fire disturbance to understand the resiliency of
   peatland biogeochemistry post-wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, due to human land management that uses fire as a
   tool, and due to abnormal droughts, many tropical forests have become
   more susceptible to recurrent wildfires with negative consequences for
   biodiversity. Yet, studies are usually focused on few taxa and rarely
   compare different fire frequencies. We examined if the effects of single
   and recurrent fires are consistent for leaf litter ants, dung beetles,
   birds (sampled with point-counts PC and mist net-MN), saplings, and
   trees. Recurrent fires had a great effect on forest structure, reducing
   live tree biomass and number of lianas, and increasing canopy openness
   and numbers of saplings alive. Recurrent fires had consistently stronger
   effects on species richness and composition across all sample groups
   than single fires, except ants. Birds and plants were more grouped in
   the congruence analysis. The average dissimilarities between control and
   recurrent-burned forest were higher than between control and once-burned
   forest for all sample groups, furthermore birds and vegetation
   communities in recurrent-burned forest are almost entirely dissimilar
   from the unburned forest. While beta diversity of ants, birds (MN), and
   trees was not affected by the frequency of fire, it changed for dung
   beetles, birds (PC), and saplings. Effects of fire on faunal community
   structure were more due to indirect effects, through vegetation, than
   through the fire itself. These results reinforce the effect of single
   and recurrent fires on tropical forests, and highlight the mechanisms
   acting behind them. Policy-makers need to explicitly address protection
   of tropical forests from wildfires in conservation planning.
   Resumo Nas ultimas decadas, devido ao uso do fogo como ferramenta de
   manejo da terra, e devido a estacoes secas longas anormais, muitas
   florestas tropicais tem se tornado mais susceptiveis ao fogo recorrente,
   com consequencias negativas para a biodiversidade. Entretanto, os
   estudos sAo normalmente focados em poucos taxa e raramente comparam
   frequencias diferentes de fogo. Nos avaliamos se os efeitos do fogo
   simples e recorrente sAo consistentes para formigas de serapilheira,
   besouros de esterco, aves (amostradas com pontos de escuta-PE e redes de
   neblina-RN), plantulas e arvores. O fogo recorrente teve um grante
   efeito sobre a estrutura da floresta, reduzindo a biomassa viva e o
   numero de cipos, e aumentando a abertura do dossel e o numero de
   plantulas. O fogo recorrente teve um efeito consistentemente maior do
   que o fogo simples sobre a riqueza e a composicAo de especies em todos
   os grupos amostrais, com excecAo das formigas. Aves e plantas
   apresentaram maior agrupamento na analise de congruencia. A
   dissimilaridade media entre floresta controle e floresta com fogo
   recorrente foi maior do que entre floresta controle e floresta com fogo
   simples para todos os grupos amostrais, e as comunidades de aves e de
   plantas em geral foram quase totalmente dissimilares da floresta

   arvores nAo ter sido afetada pela frequencia de fogo, ela mudou em

Abstract = {{Wildfires drive global biodiversity patterns and affect plant-pollinator
   interactions, and are expected to become more frequent and severe under
   climate change. Post-fire plant communities often have increased floral
   abundance and diversity, but the effects of wildfires on the ecological
   process of pollination are poorly understood. Nocturnal moths are
   globally important pollinators, but no previous study has examined the
   effects of wildfire on nocturnal pollination interactions. We
   investigated the effects of wildfire on nocturnal pollen-transport
   networks. We analysed the abundance and species richness of moths and
   flowers, and the structure of these networks, at three burned and three
   unburned sites in Portugal for two years, starting eight months after a
   large fire. Nocturnal pollen-transport networks had lower complexity and
   robustness following the fire than at nearby unburned sites. Overall,
   70\% of individual moths carried pollen, and moths were found to be
   transporting pollen from 83\% of the flower species present. Burned
   sites had significantly more abundant flowers, but less abundant and
   species-rich moths. Individual moths transported more pollen in summer
   at burned sites, but less in winter; however, total pollen transport by
   the moth assemblage at burned sites was just 20\% of that at unburned
   sites. Interaction turnover between burned and unburned networks was
   high. Negative effects of fire upon moths will likely permeate to other
   taxa through loss of mutualisms. Therefore, if wildfires become more
   frequent under climate change, community resilience may be eroded.
   Understanding the responses of ecological networks to wildfire can
   inform management that promotes resilience and facilitates
   whole-ecosystem conservation.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{842-852}},

Abstract = {{Most obligate seeder species build up a soil seed bank that is
   associated with massive seed germination in the year immediately after a
   fire. These species are also shade-intolerant and disappear when
   vegetation cover closes, creating unsuitable conditions for seedling
   recruitment. The only way for these plants to expand their populations
   is when habitats suitable for seedling recruitment arise (i.e. in years
   immediately after a fire). However, short primary seed dispersal of
   obligate seeders does not allow these plants to colonise the suitable
   habitats, and these habitats can only be colonised by secondary seed
   dispersion. We hypothesised that Fumana ericoides, an obligate-seeding
   small shrub, not only establishes abundantly in the first year after
   fire, but also expands its local range in the following years due to
   secondary dispersal by ants while suitable habitats are still available.
   We tested this hypothesis using experimental studies and a simulation
   model of potential population expansion in a recently burned area.
   Results showed that F. ericoides not only established prolifically in
   the year immediately after fire, but was also able to recruit new
   individuals and expand its population in the years following the fire,
   despite a low germination rate and short primary seed dispersal.
   Ant-mediated seed dispersal and availability of suitable habitats were
   key factors in this phenomenon: ants redistributed seeds in suitable
   habitats while they were available, which accelerated the expansion of
   F. ericoides because new plants established far away from the core
   population.}},

   corridors in proportion to their availability, and avoided logged areas.
   They preferred closed conifer stands without terrestrial lichens and
   open conifer stands with or without terrestrial lichens throughout the
   study. Open habitats (clearcuts and burns), regenerating sites, mixed
   and deciduous stands, and water bodies were avoided. The main zones used
   by caribou gradually shifted towards the southwest of the study area,
   likely as a result of disturbance and habitat loss due to logging of

Abstract = {{The jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-west Western Australia

   recognised as being of national and international significance.
   FORESTCHECK, an integrated monitoring project, was established in 2001
   to inform forest managers about changes and trends in key elements of
   forest biodiversity associated with a variety of management activities.
   FORESTCHECK monitoring is designed to provide information relevant to a
   number of regional-level indicators of ecological sustainable forest
   management, and it samples a wide range of organisms at multiple sites
   across the main environmental gradients in the jarrah forest. Monitoring
   has focused initially on the effects of timber harvesting and associated
   silvicultural treatment including regeneration release through gap
   creation, regeneration establishment using shelterwood, and selective
   harvesting. Forty-eight monitoring grids, each 2 ha in size, have been
   established within four of the jarrah forest ecosystems mapped for the
   Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement. This series of papers
   present results from five years of data collection and examines the
   response of vascular plants, cryptogams, fungi, vertebrate and
   macro-invertebrate fauna to silvicultural treatment, including the
   planned use of fire. Responses of different elements of forest
   biodiversity are interpreted in relation to changes in forest structure
   and soil disturbance caused by treatment and underlying patterns of
   moisture availability and fertility across the forest landscape. The
   FORESTCHECK project contributes to adaptive management of Western
   Australian forests by providing timely and relevant information about
   the implementation and effectiveness of silvicultural practices.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen analyses were carried out at two sites with contrasting land-use
   histories (in-field and out-land) within a single estate. The aim was to
   distinguish the relative importance of natural processes and cultural
   influence on the development of vegetation and biodiversity. The estate
   lies in the boreo-nemoral zone of southern Sweden, and attention is
   focused on the distribution of coniferous and deciduous trees. The
   in-fields, which lie close to the estate buildings, are currently
   dominated by deciduous trees, and have a documented history as fields
   and hay meadows. The more distant out-lands were primarily used as
   grazing land in the past, and support coniferous forest at present. The
   study covers the last 4000 yr. 2000-1000 BC: the out-lands site
   supported natural, dense forests consisting of Quercus, Betula, Tilia,
   Alnus and Corylus. 1000 BC-AD 1100: several events are best interpreted
   as an increased cultural activity in the area. Agriculture was based on
   animal husbandry and the recorded cereals probably originate from a kind
   of shifting cultivation. AD 1000-1800: agriculture intensified on the
   in-fields with cereal cultivation of increased importance, while the
   out-fields were used for slash-and-burn agriculture and forest grazing.
   The forests became more open in structure but the composition remained
   unchanged. An increase in Calluna was a possible consequence of
   over-exploitation. AD 1800 onwards: the out-field deciduous forests were
   rapidly replaced by Picea-Pinus coniferous forests during the 1800's.
   The in-fields retained deciduous forest with a continuity of Quercus and
   other species.
   There is a close, positive relationship between floristic diversity and
   cultural influence during the last 4000 yr. A comparison is made with a
   similar investigation on another estate in the region, revealing small
   differences between the estates, but striking similarities in the
   effects of land-use types on the development of vegetation. The
   significance of former in-fields for nature conservation is discussed,

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-58}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Question: This study evaluates historical changes in landscape structure
   and heterogeneity in subalpine forests. We use response to severe fires
   in 2001 and 2003, along with historical reconstructions to examine
   crown-fire effects on landscape heterogeneity and to assess,
   comparatively, effects of fire exclusion management in the 20th century.
   Location: Subalpine forests of Kootenay National Park (KNP), Canadian
   Rockies.
   Methods: Using a landscape-level model based on a fire-origin stand age
   map, we reconstructed decadal burned areas within the landscape for
   1750-2000 (forming reconstructed landscapes). Landscape pattern was
   analysed for each reconstructed landscape map, and we compared landscape
   pattern indices (total area, number of patches, mean patch area, patch
   area variation, largest patch index, edge density, perimeter-area ratio,
   landscape shape index) with those in 2005 after recent large fires.
   Results: After large fires in 1926, connectivity of the KNP landscape
   increased and its diversity was quite low. After 2001 and 2003 fires,
   the post-fire landscape of 2005 was highly heterogeneous in terms of
   size, variation, edge density and perimeter-area ratio of the remnant
   forest patches. Since the decline in occurrence of large fires after
   1926 reflected a period of wet weather, fuel build-up resulting from
   landscape homogenization within the 20th century landscape could not be
   attributed solely to fire exclusion. This period without fires greatly
   enhanced connectivity of late-successional forests that finally burned
   in 2001/2003, but connectivity was within the historical range for these
   forests. The gradual increase in stand connectivity before recent large
   fires may indicate that fire exclusion was less responsible than often
   believed for fuel build-up in these fire-susceptible older forests.
   Conclusions: The large fires at the beginning of the 21st century are
   within the natural range of disturbances for this landscape, and do not
   stand out as ``human-induced disasters'' in their effects on landscape
   patterns. Such stochastic large disturbances contribute to maintenance
   of highly heterogeneous landscape structure, which is important for many
   taxa and natural ecological processes. Identifying future probability of
   such large disturbances and their ecological roles should be
   incorporated into management of these dynamic, disturbance-prone
   systems.}},

   seedlings}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{379}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Concurrent with fire exclusion, shortleaf pine x loblolly pine hybrids
   have increased throughout the southeastern USA and may threaten the
   genetic integrity of shortleaf pine. Historically, fire favored short
   leaf pine over other southern pine species, especially loblolly pine,
   with which it shares a broad sympatric natural range. Shortleaf pine
   seedlings have a morphological adaptation (basal crook) that lowers
   dormant buds to the soil surface where they are presumably protected
   from fire to facilitate resprouting after topkill. To evaluate this
   presumption, we tested (1) the functional role of the basal crook in
   protecting dormant buds by measuring resprouting after exposing the
   lower stem of shortleaf pine to fire and protecting from fire the lower
   stem (and dormant buds) of loblolly pine (which lacks a basal crook) and
   (2) the occurrence and importance of the basal crook morphological
   adaptation in Fl shortleaf x loblolly pine seedlings by comparing
   morphology and post-fire resprouting of the hybrids to both parents.
   Fire exposure of shortleaf pine seedling dormant buds caused seedling
   mortality, while protecting loblolly pine dormant buds facilitated
   resprouting. Hybrid pines have basal crooks intermediate to the strong
   crook of shortleaf pine and loblolly pine's non-crooked stem. Fire

   kill during two dormant season and one growing season burns. This highly
   significant difference shows that the basal crook is important for
   shortleaf pine resprouting after topkill by fire. Fire is an important

   competitive advantage to shortleaf pine relative to loblolly pine, for
   ecosystem restoration and maintaining the genetic integrity of shortleaf

Abstract = {{A major reason for alarm over the rate and magnitude of deforestation in
   Brazil has been concern that the reduction in vegetation releases carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) that may contribute to
   global climate change. While deforestation releases CO2 and other GHG,
   however, tree growth elsewhere absorbs atmospheric carbon (C) through
   photosynthesis. discussions of CO2 releases from tropical deforestation
   have tended to focus on gross releases and have generally not considered
   the effects of carbon uptake. The objective of this paper is to examine
   the net C balance for Brazil, by estimating both CO2 - C release and
   uptake.
   Our approach was to construct a generalized conceptual model of
   ecosystem C cycling that could be applied to any vegetation type and can
   be quantified with available data. the primary C pools in the model are
   the atmosphere, live vegetation, litter and coarse woody debris, and
   soil. Fluxes are represented as transfer between these pools that occur
   as a result of land use change, disturbance or recovery from past
   disturbance by plant growth and accumulation of organic matter. To
   estimate ecosystem areas, we used and adapted the most recently
   completed and current vegetation map available (Stone et al. in press).
   The primary sources for C density data were a report compiled by Olson
   et al (1983) and a subsequent version. We also used an alternative C
   density for closed moist forest from Brown and Lugo (1992). These
   forests play a major role in Brazil's C balance, but there is some
   uncertainty regarding their C density. We attempted to bracket this
   uncertainty by using both high and low values.
   We also used published data to calculate flux estimates. A major flux in
   Brazil's C budget is release to the atmphere resulting from
   deforestation. In 1990, 1.38 x 10(6) ha of closed forest were cleared in
   Brazil. Additionally, about 1.0 x 10(6) ha of cerrado woodland also
   cleared. We also estimated that 0.35 x 10(6) ha of secondary forest were
   cleared that year.
   Total C releases for the country as a whole were 174 - 233 x 10(6)
   tc/yr. The difference was caused mostly by differing estimates in the C
   density of closed tropical moist forests, which resulted in different
   fluxes from deforestation and burning.
   Net changes in pool sizes of our C budget model varied. The total
   vegetation C pool decreased by 160 - 240 x 10(6) tc/yr. The soil pool
   also lost C, about 80 x 10(6) tc/yr as a result of disturbance from
   forest clearing and intensive agriculture. However, the litter/coarse
   woody debris pool increased by 70 - 90 x 10(6) tc/yr. This increase was
   due to transfers from the vegetation pool due to clearing of closed
   tropical moist forest.
   Total gross C uptake by the system was 100 x 10(6) tc/yr of which 60 x
   10(6) was addition to litter and soil pools in secondary forets. Total C
   releases were 120 - 150 x 10(6) tC/yr from deforestatio/burning and 150
   - 180 x 10(6) tC/yr from decomposition. Most of the C released from
   burning was derived from above-ground vegetation but a significant
   amount also came form litter and coarse woody debris, including from
   reburning of residual logs and pastures.}},

Abstract = {{A better understanding of biomass production in secondary forests after
   cultivation is essential for assessing the resilience of slash and burn
   systems and their capacity to deliver ecosystem services. Biomass
   production is influenced by management legacies, landscape configuration
   and soil, but these drivers are rarely studied simultaneously, nor is
   the role of changes in vegetation properties in linking them to biomass
   production. We assessed how management legacies affect biomass in
   secondary forests created by slash and burn in the central Congo Basin,
   and tested whether changes in productivity could be attributed to
   changes in stem density, functional diversity, functional identity or
   soil. Using data from 6452 trees in 96 fallow plots nested in 3 study
   sites, we looked for the main determinants of aboveground biomass (AGB)
   of woody vegetation in fallow systems. Next, using a subset of 58 plots
   in fallow fields aged 5 to 10 years, we used confirmatory path analysis
   to explore the relations between management history, soil, vegetation
   properties and biomass productivity. The sampled fallow fields had, on
   average, 58.4(+/- 46.2) Mg ha(-1) AGB. AGB was positively related to
   both fallow age and to the proportion of remnant trees in AGB and
   negatively related to the number of previous cultivation cycles. Biomass
   productivity varied with the number of previous slash-and-burn cycles,
   with notable declines in the fourth cycle. The effect of management
   history was mainly through a reduction in the dominance of fast growing
   tree species and in the number of regenerating stems, which were also
   indirectly affected by an increase in C. odorata cover. Soil fertility
   status and the biomass of remnant trees also modified biomass
   productivity. Our findings suggest that under the current management
   intensity the capacity of the slash and burn system to provide important
   ecosystem functions, such as carbon sequestration, is declining. (c)

Abstract = {{The invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) forms a positive
   feedback with fire in some areas of western North America's sagebrush
   biome by increasing fire frequency and size, which then increases B.
   tectorum abundance post-fire and dramatically alters ecosystem structure
   and processes. However, this positive response to fire is not consistent
   across the sagebrush steppe. Here, we ask whether different climate
   conditions across the sagebrush biome can explain B. tectorum's variable
   response to fire. We found that climate variables differed significantly
   between 18 sites where B. tectorum does and does not respond positively
   to fire. A positive response was most likely in areas with higher annual
   temperatures and lower summer precipitation. We then chose a
   climatically intermediate site, with intact sagebrush vegetation, to
   evaluate whether a positive feedback had formed between B. tectorum and
   fire. A chronosequence of recent fires (1-15 years) at the site created
   a natural replicated experiment to assess abundance of B. tectorum and
   native plants. B. tectorum cover did not differ between burned and
   unburned plots but native grass cover was higher in recently burned
   plots. Therefore, we found no evidence for a positive feedback between
   B. tectorum and fire at the study site. Our results suggest that
   formation of a positive B. tectorum-fire feedback depends on climate;
   however, other drivers such as disturbance and native plant cover are
   likely to further influence local responses of B. tectorum. The
   dependence of B. tectorum's response to fire on climate suggests that
   climate change may expand B. tectorum's role as a transformative
   invasive species within the sagebrush biome.}},

Abstract = {{We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to simulate tree
   encroachment and tree control measures in a continental heathland in
   Southern Europe, where the goal is the conservation of Calluna vulgaris
   (L.) Hull. We selected as the management target a maximum tree basal
   area of 4.6 m(2) ha(-1), corresponding to a minimum Calluna cover of
   25\%, and modeled stand dynamics along a 50-year period under three
   management scenarios: no management; low-frequency prescribed burning;
   and low-frequency prescribed burning followed by annual grazing. We
   initialized and calibrated the Northeastern variant of FVS with data
   measured in the field and the Fire and Fuel Extension with additional
   data from a prescribed burning experiment. We carried out most
   calibrations by multipliers, including a novel way to simulate the
   impact of grazing on shoot height and survival. To simulate fire
   behavior, we designed a custom fire behavior fuel model for heath fuels.
   Successful validation of simulated stand-scale attributes and postfire
   mortality was carried out using equivalence testing. Model projections
   showed that stand basal area would exceed the target threshold under
   both the no-management and the prescribed burning scenario, 5 and 10
   years into the simulation, respectively. Conversely, prescribed burning
   followed by yearly grazing successfully controlled encroaching trees

   threshold associated with the maintenance of the heathland cultural
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are among the basic ecological factors that change habitats
   and initiate the succession of new forest communities. Burned areas are
   ephemeral habitats presenting a broad range of ecological niches that
   many insect species may exploit. In 2016, we studied the carabid fauna
   in burned pine forests of the Mordovia State Nature Reserve (European
   Russia). Sixty carabid beetles in total were collected in an unburned
   (control) area and on sites damaged by crown fire and surface fire.
   Carabids were more numerous and diverse in the burned areas, compared to
   the unburned forest, while the catch index was significantly higher in
   unburned area. This was due to the extremely high dynamic density of
   Carabus arcensis on the control site, while it was ten times lower in
   the burned area. The number of carabid species tended to increase in the
   sequence unburned forest - forest impacted by surface fire - forest
   impacted by crown fire. Expectedly, species compositions were more
   similar between fire-damaged areas, while there was a higher difference
   between the unburned site and area damaged by crown fire. Concerning
   trophic group classification, all carabid beetles were distinguished in
   two groups, zoophagous species and myxophytophagous species. In both
   groups, the species number increases in the sequence from unburned areas
   to the forest impacted by crown fire. Finally, the dynamic density of
   some carabids (e.g. Poecilus lepidus, P. versicolor, Harpalus tardus, H.
   rufipes, H. rubripes, Cicindela sylvatica) largely increased after fire
   impact, while it decreased for the most other species. Our results
   suggest that burning of the forest stand may support some carabid
   species, i.e. larger forest fire increases species richness of beetle
   fauna. The highest dynamic density of the carabids is maintained by a
   few beetle species (Carabus arcensis, C. hortensis, Pterostichus
   oblongopunctatus).}},

Abstract = {{P>This study investigates if Araucaria forest (C-3 metabolism) expansion
   on frequently burnt grassland (C-4 metabolism) in the southern Brazilian
   highland is linked to the chemical composition of soil organic matter

   signature to group heavy organo-mineral fractions according to source
   vegetation and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, lignin analyses (CuO oxidation)
   and measurement of soil colour lightness to characterize their chemical
   compositions. Large proportions of aromatic carbon (C) combined with
   small contents of lignin-derived phenols in the heavy fractions of
   grassland soils and grass-derived lower horizons of Araucaria forest
   soils indicate the presence of charred grass residues in SOM. The
   contribution of this material may have led to the unusual increase in
   C/N ratios with depth in burnt grassland soils and to the
   differentiation of C-3- and C-4-derived SOM, because heavy fractions
   from unburnt Araucaria forest and shrubland soils have smaller
   proportions of aromatic C, smaller C/N ratios and are paler compared
   with those with C-4 signatures. We found that lignins are not applicable
   as biomarkers for plant origin in these soils with small contents of
   strongly degraded and modified lignins as the plant-specific lignin
   patterns are absent in heavy fractions. In contrast, the characteristic
   contents of alkyl C and O/N-alkyl C of C-3 trees or shrubs and C-4
   grasses are reflected in the heavy fractions. They show consistent
   changes of the (alkyl C)/(O/N-alkyl C) ratio and the C-13/C-12 isotopic

   understory species diversity and composition and tree seedling
   regeneration patterns the first and second years following a prescribed
   burn in the Conasauga River Watershed of southeastern Tennessee and
   northern Georgia. We asked: Can a single dormant season fire initiate a
   trajectory of overstory and understory species change consistent with
   restoring Pinus echinata/mixed-oak/bluestem (Andropogon gyrans and
   Schizachyrium scoparium)-grass community types? Six sub-watersheds
   (similar in vegetation, soil type, stream size, and disturbance history)
   were located within the Conasauga River Watershed; four of the sites
   were burned in March 2001, and two sites were designated as controls.
   Within each site, vegetation was measured in layers: the overstory layer
   (trees >= 5.0-cm DBH), the midstory layer (woody stems < 5.0-cm DBH and
   0.5 m height), and the ground flora layer (woody stems < 0.5-m height
   and all herbaceous species). All plots were sampled before the
   prescribed burn (Sept. 2000) and after the burn in July of 2001 and
   2002. Consistent with the goals of the land managers, all the prescribed
   fires resulted in low-to-moderate intensity and low severity fires.
   However, we found no significant change in overstory, midstory, or
   ground flora species diversity after burning. We found no regeneration
   of P. echinata seedlings after the prescribed fire. Although fire
   reduced basal area of woody species in the midstory, prolific sprouting
   from hardwoods resulted in higher density of fire-sensitive hardwoods
   such as Acer rubrum, Oxydendrum arboretum, and Nyssa sylvatica. Density
   of Pinus strobus, an undesirable species, was reduced by 20 \% and its
   basal area was reduced by 50 \% after the burn. Overstory mortality
   occurred in small size class hardwoods as a result of the fire, but most
   of the mortality occurred in P. echinata and P. virginiana Miller due to
   infestation with pine bark beetles. The prescribed fires were not of
   sufficient intensity to: reduce overstory basal area, prepare a seedbed
   for successful pine germination, affect diversity of any of the
   vegetation layers, or promote A. gyrans and S. scoparium recruitment.
   Thus, additional fire treatments or a combination of fire and thinning
   treatments will be necessary to restore these ecosystems to P.
   echinata/mixed-oak/bluestern grass community types.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of fire in the creation and maintenance of mesic
   grassland communities is well recognized. Improved understanding of how
   grasses - the dominant clade in these important ecosystems - will
   respond to alterations in fire regimes is needed in the face of
   anthropogenically driven climate and land-use change.
   Here, we examined how grass communities shift in response to
   experimentally manipulated fire regimes at multiple levels of community
   diversity - taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional - in C-4-dominanted
   mesic savanna grassland sites with similar structure and physiognomy,
   yet disparate biogeographic histories.
   We found that the grass communities were similar in their phylogenetic
   response and aspects of their functional response to high fire
   frequency. Both sites exhibited phylogenetic clustering of highly
   abundant species in annually burned plots, driven by species of the
   Andropogoneae, and a narrow range of functional strategies associated
   with rapid post-fire regeneration in a high-light, nitrogen-limited
   environment.
   By examining multiple facets of diversity in a comparative context, we
   identified convergent phylogenetic and functional responses to altered
   fire regimes in two mesic savanna grasslands. Our results highlight the
   importance of a common filtering process associated with fire that is
   consistent across grasslands of disparate biogeographic histories and
   taxonomic representation.}},

Abstract = {{Old field secondary succession of tropical dry forests (TDFs) is poorly
   understood, particularly regarding the dynamics of seedlings, saplings,
   and sprouts (regenerative communities). We used chronosequence and
   dynamic approaches to: (1) document successional trajectories of
   regenerative communities during the first dozen years of regeneration in
   abandoned pastures at Chamela, Mexico; (2) test the usefulness of
   chronosequences to predict the dynamics of regenerative communities
   along time; and (3) assess the influence of surrounding forest matrix,
   stand density, and understory light availability (in the rainy season)
   as driving factors of such dynamics. More than 1000 plants and 95
   species of shrubs and trees 10-100 cm tall were monitored between 2004
   and 2007 in nine abandoned pastures (0-12 yr since abandonment) and two
   old-growth forest (OGF) sites; gain and loss rates of plants, species,
   and plant cover were obtained. Chronosequence predicted a rapid and
   asymptotic increase of plant density, species density, and plant cover
   toward the OGF values. Such prediction did not match with dynamic data
   that showed negative or neutral net community rates of change,
   independently of fallow age. Recruitment and species gain rates
   increased with the amount surrounding forest matrix. No other effect of
   the explored factors was detected. Strong rainfall shortenings could be
   responsible for the high loss and low gain rates of plants and species
   recorded in most sites. We highlight the critical role of supra-annual
   rainfall variability on the dynamics of TDF regenerative communities and
   the poor predictive value of chronosequences in forest systems subjected
   to strong environmental temporal variation.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Restoration practices incorporating timber harvest (e.g. to remove
   undesirable species or reduce tree densities) may generate
   unmerchantable wood debris that is piled and burned for fuel reduction.
   Slash pile burns are common in longleaf pine ecosystem restoration that
   involves hardwood removal before reintroduction of frequent prescribed
   fire. In this context, long-lasting effects of slash pile burns may
   complicate restoration outcomes due to unintended alterations to
   vegetation, soils, and the soil seed bank. In this study, our objectives
   were to (1) examine alterations to the soil seed bank, soil physical and
   chemical characteristics, and initial vegetation recolonization
   following burn and (2) determine the rate of return of soil and
   vegetation characteristics to pre-burn conditions. We found that burning
   of slash piles (composed of scores of whole trees) results in elevated
   nutrient levels and significant impacts on vegetation and the soil seed
   bank, which remain evident for at least 6 years following burn. In this
   ecosystem, formerly weakly acidic soils become neutral to basic and
   levels of P remain significantly higher. Following an initial decrease
   after burn, total soil N increases with time since burn. These changes
   suggest that not only does pile burning create a fire scar initially
   devoid of biota, but it also produces an altered soil chemical
   environment, with possible consequences for long-term ecosystem
   restoration efforts in landscapes including numerous fire scars. To
   facilitate restoration trajectories, further adaptive management to
   incorporate native plant propagules or suppress encroaching hardwoods
   within fire scars may be warranted in fire-dependent ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon sequestration in the soil and the main contributing factors,
   elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentration and temperature increase, are
   discussed for forests of the Northern Hemisphere. The role of the
   process of decomposition, particularly in the later stages, in the
   amounts of C accumulating in the soil was emphasised and the decrease of
   C storage was reported for uplands of the UK as a consequence of
   experimental soil warming. Warming of northern wetlands was shown to be
   a major positive feedback in CH(4) emissions from the soil, while it was
   reported that drainage of wetlands reduces CH(4) emissions. Increased
   CO(2) concentration and N deposition are further factors influencing the
   fluxes of CH(4) from/to the soil. Tropical forest soils and fertilised
   agricultural soils were recognised as the main contributors to N(2)O
   emissions, with N fertilisation and deposition increasing N(2)O
   emissions; global warming is expected to induce positive feedback on
   N(2)O emissions. The possibility of a greater involvement of soil fungi
   as a source of N(2)O was discussed. Reduced S-gases are biogenically
   produced and consumed in the soil; there is a gap in the knowledge of
   the mechanisms of production and consumption of S-gases and a large
   uncertainty of the magnitude of the exchange between soil and
   atmosphere, also due to technical difficulties in measuring atmospheric
   sulphur species. It was showed that soil might act as a source and a
   sink for COS. Biomass burning, which contributes ca. 40\% of CO(2)
   global emissions and 38\% of tropospheric O(3), influences the chemical
   composition of the atmosphere also through biogenic post-fire emissions.
   The data currently available on the long term effect of fires are few,
   but it was shown that in Mediterranean environments increased CO(2) and
   N(2)O fluxes from the soil may last up to one year and that soil
   microbial activity increases after fire.}},

Abstract = {{The resilience of closed-crown coniferous stands within the boreal
   forest of North America is highly dependent on successful
   re-establishment of tree species following fire. A shift from
   closed-crown forest to open lichen woodland is possible following poor
   natural regeneration during the initial establishment phase, followed by
   the development of extensive lichen cover, which may hinder ongoing
   recruitment. We examined the development of the crustose lichen
   Trapeliopsis granulosa (Hoffm.) 18 to 21 years following fire within six
   sites in the boreal forest of northwestern Quebec, and explored its
   potential to affect ongoing recruitment during early successional stages
   of stand development. Germination and survivorship trials were conducted
   within the laboratory to determine the establishment rate of Pinus
   banksiana Lamb. (jack pine) on T. granulosa, mineral soil, and burnt
   duff under two separate watering frequencies (observed and drought).
   Survival and establishment rates of jack pine were highest on burnt
   duff, and poor on both T. granulosa and mineral soil. Under the drought
   treatment, no seedlings survived on any substrates. In the field, T.
   granulosa cover had a positive relationship with mineral soil cover, and
   negative relationships with duff cover, ericaceous shrub cover, organic
   layer depth, other lichen cover, and Sphagnum moss cover. No discernable
   relationship was found between T. granulosa and tree density, rock
   cover, dead wood cover or other moss cover. The development of extensive
   T. granulosa cover in fire-initiated stands can impede ongoing
   recruitment of conifer species due to its poor seedbed quality, thereby

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Exploring the human dimensions of forest fires is a crucial, although
   often overlooked, aspect of wildfire research, since wildfires often
   have important socio-economic impacts and humans are nowadays the main
   cause of wildfires in many areas of the world. We carried out a
   telephone survey (N = 345 interviews) in one of the most fire-prone
   areas in Europe (NW Spain) in order to assess citizens' awareness about
   wildfire causes and risks, their perception of the value of the
   vegetation and of administrative measures to fight against fires.
   Perceptions of respondents about fire causes were in general realistic
   although fires caused by pyromaniacs and for profit were overestimated,
   while vegetation management was comparatively underestimated. Citizens
   were broadly aware of the fire risk associated with different vegetation
   types, rightly considering native oak forests and agricultural fields as
   less risky than shrublands and pine and eucalypt plantations.
   Tree-dominated vegetation was more valued than treeless formations, and
   native forests more than tree plantations, which seems related to a
   preference for ecological value over utilitarian considerations. In
   addition, the value of eucalypt plantations was clearly affected by the
   education level of respondents, being less valued as the education level
   increased. Most citizens considered that the administration was not
   doing enough to fight against fires. The law that compels landowners to
   reduce fuels in wildland-urban interfaces was considered effective by
   most respondents (72\%), but 50\% considered it difficult to implement
   by landowners. This may explain the poor degree of compliance of this
   law.}},

Abstract = {{After fossil fuel burning, clearing of forests for agriculture is the
   second most significant factor increasing levels of atmospheric carbon
   dioxide. Replanting trees on previously cleared land around the world
   could reduce the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, forests
   were usually cleared to grow crops or graze animals, so there is no
   possibility of completely restoring forests on most cleared lands. There
   is a need to develop agroforestry systems, which integrate trees with
   agricultural activities.
   One of the key problems in developing successful agroforestry systems is
   identifying which trees can be successfully grown in different areas.
   This problem will become even greater as tree breeding produces a wider
   variety of genotypes available for planting. General methods are
   described to identify where a particular tree (species, provenance or
   clone) with potential for use in agroforestry systems can be grown. The
   methods also help to identify locations where particular trees are
   growing under relatively extreme climatic conditions for that taxa.
   Conditions at these locations should be carefully evaluated as more
   reliable future climatic scenarios are developed. In the meantime they
   could be monitored to provide early warning of the effects of climatic

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to fire suppression policies, timber harvest, and other management
   practices over the last century, many low-to mid-elevation forests in
   semiarid parts of the western United States have accumulated high fuel
   loads and dense, multi-layered canopies that are dominated by
   shade-tolerant and fire-sensitive conifers. To a great extent, the
   future status of western US forests will depend on tree species'
   responses to patterns and trends in fire activity and fire behavior and
   postfire management decisions. This is especially the case in the North
   American Mediterranean-climate zone (NAMCZ), which supports the highest
   precipitation variability in North America and a 4- to 6-month annual
   drought, and has seen greater-than-average increases in air temperature
   and fire activity over the last three decades. We established 1490
   survey plots in 14 burned areas on 10 National Forests across a range of
   elevations, forest types, and fire severities in the central and
   northern NAMCZ to provide insight into factors that promote natural tree
   regeneration after wildfires and the differences in postfire responses
   of the most common conifer species. We measured site characteristics,
   seedling densities, woody shrub, and tree growth. We specified a
   zero-inflated negative binomial mixed model with random effects to
   understand the importance of each measured variable in predicting
   conifer regeneration. Across all fires, 43\% of all plots had no conifer
   regeneration. Ten of the 14 fires had median conifer seedling densities
   that did not meet Forest Service stocking density thresholds for mixed
   conifer forests. When regeneration did occur, it was dominated by
   shade-tolerant but fire-sensitive firs (Abies spp.), Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens).
   Seedling densities of conifer species were lowest in sites that burned
   at high severity, principally due to the biotic consequences of high
   severity fire, for example, increased distances to live seed trees and
   competition with fire-following shrubs. We developed a second model
   specifically for forest managers and restoration practitioners who work
   in yellow pine and mixed conifer forests in the central NAMCZ to assess
   potential natural regeneration in the years immediately following a
   fire, allowing them to prioritize which areas may need active postfire
   forest restoration and supplemental planting.}},

Abstract = {{Salvage logging in burned forests can negatively affect habitat for
   white-headed woodpeckers (Dryobates albolarvatus), a species of
   conservation concern, but also meets socioeconomic demands for timber
   and human safety. Habitat suitability index (HSI) models can inform

   objectives. Informing post-fire forest management, however, involves
   model application at new locations as wildfires occur, requiring
   evaluation of predictive performance across locations. We developed HSI
   models for white-headed woodpeckers using nest sites from two
   burned-forest locations in Oregon, the Toolbox (2002) and Canyon Creek
   (2015) fires. We measured predictive performance by developing one model
   at each of the two locations and quantifying discrimination of nest from
   reference sites at two other wildfire locations where the model had not
   been developed (either Toolbox or Canyon Creek, and the Barry Point Fire
   {[}2011]). We developed and evaluated Maxent models based on remotely
   sensed environmental metrics to support habitat mapping, and weighted
   logistic regression (WLR) models that combined remotely sensed and
   field-collected metrics to inform management prescriptions. Both Maxent
   and WLR models developed either at Canyon Creek or Toolbox performed
   adequately to inform management when applied at the alternate Toolbox or
   Canyon Creek location, respectively (area under the
   receiver-operating-characteristic curve {[}AUC] range = 0.61-0.72) but
   poorly when applied at Barry Point (AUC = 0.53-0.57). The final HSI
   models fitted to Toolbox and Canyon Creek data quantified suitable
   nesting habitat as severely burned or open sites adjacent to lower
   severity and closed canopy sites, where foraging presumably occurs. We
   suggest these models are applicable at locations similar to development
   locations but not at locations resembling Barry Point, which were
   characterized by more (pre-fire) canopy openings, larger diameter trees,
   less ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and more juniper (Juniperus
   occidentalis). Considering our results, we recommend caution when
   applying HSI models developed at individual wildfire locations to inform
   postfire management at new locations without first evaluating predictive
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, the parasitic fungus Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) was
   detected in Australia. Austropuccinia psidii infects immature growth of
   myrtaceous species. Many of Australia's myrtaceous species occur within
   fire-prone vegetation communities and have the capacity to resprout
   after fire. Therefore, it is likely that new post-fire growth may be
   vulnerable to A. psidii infection, causing subsequent flow-on effects to
   species' persistence and community dynamics. The aim of this study was
   to test the impacts of A. psidii on native Australian Myrtaceae species
   after fire. We grew eight native susceptible species in a glasshouse
   experiment before burning them and inoculating the resprouting new
   growth of half the plants with A. psidii. We assessed the effect of A.
   psidii on the architecture, growth and biomass allocation of our study
   species. Although general patterns were observed across species, results
   were found to be species-specific. Austropuccinia psidii significantly
   reduced the height of two of the eight species (Callistemon citrinus and
   Eucalyptus moluccana), but none of the species had increased branching.
   As expected, specific leaf area was lower (9\%) in inoculated plants -
   although only significant for C. citrinus and E. dalrympleana - and leaf
   biomass was greater (15\%), but significant for Angophora costata only.
   Finally, biomass allocation did not significantly differ between
   infection treatments. We can conclude that the effect of A. psidii
   infection on fire-damaged plants has significant impacts on plants at
   the species level, which may have flow-on effects at the community
   level, especially after repeated infections. Furthermore, these impacts
   may be exacerbated in the future under climate change, as the predicted
   increase in frequency and intensity of fires across Australia will
   result in more frequent new growth availability, providing more
   opportunities for A. psidii infection.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impact of wildfire on the climate of
   Southern Africa. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived
   burned area fraction data was implemented in a set of simulations to
   assess primarily the role of wildfire-induced surface changes on monthly
   precipitation. Two post-fire scenarios are examined namely
   non-recovering and recovering vegetation scenarios. In the former,
   burned vegetation fraction remains burned until the end of the
   simulations, whereas in the latter it is allowed to regrow following a
   recovery period. Control simulations revealed that the model can
   dependably capture the monthly precipitation and surface temperature
   averages in Southern Africa thus providing a reasonable basis against
   which to assess the impacts of wildfire. In general, both wildfire
   scenarios have a negative impact on springtime precipitation. September
   and October were the only months with statistically significant
   precipitation changes. During these months, precipitation in the region
   decreases by approximately 13 and 9\% in the non-recovering vegetation
   scenario, and by about 10 and 6\% in the recovering vegetation wildfire
   scenario, respectively. The primary cause of precipitation deficit is
   the decrease in evapotranspiration resulting from a reduction in surface
   net radiation. Areas impacted by the precipitation reduction includes
   the Luanda, Kinshasa, and Brazzaville metropolitan areas, The Angolan
   Highlands, which are the source of the Okavango Rive, and the Okavango
   Delta region. This study suggests that a probable intensification in
   wildfire frequency and extent resulting from projected population
   increase and global warming in Southern Africa could potentially
   exacerbate the impacts of wildfires in the region's seasonal
   precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated effects of fire frequency, seasonal timing, and plant
   community on patchiness and intensity of prescribed fires in subtropical
   savannas in the Long Pine Key region of Everglades National Park,
   Florida (U.S.A.). We measured patchiness and intensity in different
   plant communities along elevation gradients in ``fire blocks.{''} These
   blocks were prescribed burned at varying times during the lightning
   season and at different frequencies between 1995 and 2000. Fire
   frequency, seasonal timing, and plant community all influenced the
   patchiness and intensity of prescribed fires. Fires were less patchy and
   more intense, probably because of drier conditions and pyrogenic fuels,
   in higher elevation plant communities (e.g., high pine savannas) than in
   lower elevation communities (e.g., long-hydroperiod prairies). In all
   plant communities fires became increasingly patchy and less intense as
   the wet season progressed and moisture accumulated in fuels. Frequent
   prescribed fire resulted in increased patchiness but a wider range of
   intensities; higher intensities appeared to result from regrowth of more
   flammable vegetation. Our study suggests that frequent early lightning
   season prescribed fires produce a wider range of post-fire conditions
   than less frequent late lightning season prescribed fires. Our study
   also suggests that natural early lightning season fires readily carried
   through pine savannas and short-hydroperiod prairies, but lower
   elevation long-hydroperiod prairies functioned as firebreaks. Natural
   fires probably crossed these firebreaks only during drier years,
   potentially producing large landscape-level fires. Knowledge of how
   patchily and intensely fires burn across a savanna landscape should be
   useful for developing landscape-level fire management.}},

   at three-month intervals between February 1995 and May 1996. During
   November 1995 a low- intensity experimental fire burned the entire home
   range of most animals. The northern bettong appeared fairly catholic in
   choice of nest site, with a variety of nest locations and nesting
   materials used. Prior to the fire, nests were generally located in areas
   of dense cover, such as the skirts of grass trees (46\%) or grass close
   to a log (29\%). After fire removed most ground cover in the nesting
   areas of most animals, bettongs used remaining shelter such as boulder
   piles (45\%), recently fallen trees (8\%) and patches of unburnt
   vegetation (21\%). Nest areas (10.1 ha) of males were significantly
   larger than those of females (5.4 ha). Home ranges of both sexes were
   large (59 ha) and most ranges lacked distinct core areas, suggesting
   that bettongs used all parts of their home ranges equally. High mean
   rates of nightly movement by the northern bettong indicated that large
   distances were moved within home ranges during nightly foraging. No
   significant fire-related changes were detected in home-range size,

Abstract = {{Aim
   We tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic fires favour the successful
   establishment of alien annual species to the detriment of natives in the
   Chilean coastal matorral.
   Location
   Valparaiso Region, central Chile
   Methods
   We sampled seed rain, seedbank emergence and establishment of species in
   four paired burned and unburned areas and compared (using GLMM) fire
   resistance and propagule arrival of alien and native species. To assess
   the relative importance of seed dispersal and seedbank survival in
   explaining plant establishment after fire, we compared seed rain and
   seedbank structure with post-fire vegetation using ordination analyses.
   Results
   Fire did not change the proportion of alien species in the coastal
   matorral. However, fire increased the number of annual species (natives
   and aliens) of which 87\% were aliens. Fire reduced the alien seedbank
   and not the native seedbank, but alien species remained dominant in
   burned soil samples (66\% of the total species richness). Seed rain was
   higher for alien annuals than for native annuals or perennials, thus
   contributing to their establishment after fire. Nevertheless, seed rain
   was less important than seedbank survival in explaining plant
   establishment in burned areas.
   Main conclusions
   Anthropogenic fires favoured alien and native annuals. Thus, fire did
   not increase the alien/native ratio but increased the richness of alien
   species. The successful establishment of alien annuals was attributable
   to their ability to maintain rich seedbanks in burned areas and to the
   greater propagule arrival compared to native species. The native
   seedbank also survived fire, indicating that the herbaceous community
   has become highly resilient after centuries of human disturbances. Our
   results demonstrate that fire is a relevant factor for the maintenance
   of alien-dominated grasslands in the matorral and highlight the
   importance of considering the interactive effect of seed rain and
   seedbank survival to understand plant invasion patterns in fire-prone
   ecosystems.}},

   the fallout from the damaged nuclear energy plant at Chernobyl (ChNPP)
   was shown within the territory of the 10-km zone.  During the period

   Mortality rate, re-establishment, development of tree canopies,
   reproduction anomalies and stand viability were shown to be dependent on
   absorbed irradiation dose, on the age of the stand and on forest
   composition.  For pine stands in the acutely affected zone, doses of
   more than 60 Gy resulted in a massive mortality and no regeneration of
   pine trees since 1987.  The injured trees had burned or had dried-up. 
   The drying process was accelerated by a massive production of pathogenic
   insects invading the dying trees.  Specifically, irradiation doses of
   10-60 Gy, 1-10 Gy and 0.1-1 Gy caused high, medium and low injury to the
   forest stands, respectively.  Doses of less than 0.1 Gy did not cause
   any visible damage to the trees.  In 1987, repair processes were
   displayed by the tree canopies and practically the entire viability of
   the forest stands had recovered except for trees in the acute and highly
   affected zones.  The young forest was reestablished in the same place as

Abstract = {{The eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) has
   experienced population declines throughout its range and is now a
   candidate for federal protection. However, little is known about
   massasauga habitat selection in Michigan, particularly in actively

   massasaugas in southwestern Michigan select certain vegetation types
   disproportionately to their availability and 2) quantify whether the
   vegetation structure associated with snake locations differed between
   managed (e.g., burning, woody species removal) and unmanaged stands. We
   implanted radio transmitters in 51 snakes from 2004 to 2005 and 2008 to
   2009. We quantified second-order resource selection using compositional
   analysis, and modeled the effect of habitat management efforts on
   vegetation using 4 structural variables. All snakes selected cover types
   disproportionately to their availability (P?=?0.001); a ranking matrix
   ordered the vegetation types, from most to least used, as: early-mid

Abstract = {{In 1975 and 1976, an experimental burning program was conducted in an
   immature stand of boreal jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) growing on
   level, granitic outwash sands in northern Ontario. Nine 0.4-ha plots
   were burned under a range of fire weather conditions and sampling was
   conducted to examine the effect of fire on soil chemical changes and
   revegetation. Results indicated that depth of burn (DOB) affected both
   soil chemical changes and plant succession on these pine sites.
   Vaccinium angustifolium Ait., Oryzopsis spp,. Waldsteinia fragarioides
   (Michx.) Tratt, Salix spp. and Viola adunca Sm. increased in cover at
   two levels of DOE but the increase was greatest at the lower DOE and
   decreased to pre-burn levels after 10 yr. Comptonia peregrina (L.)
   Coult., Epilobium angustifolium L., Polytrichum commune Hedw. and
   Amelanchier sanguinea (Pursh) DC. were not found in the pre-burn surveys
   but appeared after burning. Vegetation cover for these species was
   always higher at the deeper DOE but decreased almost to zero after 10
   yr. Other species such as Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt., Linnaea
   borealis L., Corylus cornuta Marsh., Cladina rangiferina (L.) Nyl, and
   Aralia nudicaulis L. were eliminated from the site and did not recover
   even after 10 yr. Soil pH increased 0.3 to 1.0 pH units in the organic
   and mineral soil layers. The rate of increase in pH was always steeper
   at the higher DOE and pH returned to pre-burn levels in the mineral soil
   layers after 10 yr. Immediately after burning, exchangeable Ca in the
   mineral soil layers doubled but 10 yr later, Ca returned to preburn
   levels. Phosphorus and K increased in the mineral soil, leveled off and
   were still elevated after 10 yr. Total Kjeldahl N was reduced by 50\% in
   the organic soil while N in all mineral soils increased, and was still
   increasing after 10 yr. Except for immediate post-fire increases in pH,
   Ca and N, soil chemical changes were small or they rebounded to pre-burn
   levels 10 yr after burning. Therefore it is unlikely that these changes
   were the cause of the plant cover changes that persisted to 10 yr.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent fires were used as a management tool to maintain prairies,

   the establishment and growth of fire-intolerant species such as eastern
   redcedar (Juniperus virginiana: ERC) beyond their naturally occurring
   habitats. Apart from the reduction in burning, wide soil and climate
   adaptability, and seed dispersal by birds have facilitated the expansion
   of ERC in the southern Great Plains. The encroachment of ERC has caused
   heavy ecological and economic losses to Oklahoma and thus has been a
   major management concern for the past few decades. This study utilized
   count data modeling to analyze USDA Forest Service's (USFS) Forest
   Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to investigate the relationship
   between available ecological and economic factors and the abundance of
   ERC in grassland and forested ecosystems of Oklahoma. The results
   suggested that low site productivity, high basal area, dense canopy, and
   silt loam soil texture significantly increase the abundance of ERC on a
   given site. The results also indicated that the rate of ERC encroachment
   is 3.3\% higher in the softwood and 2.0\% higher in the miscellaneous

   Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or

Abstract = {{A proposal for characterizing habitat of forests, obtained from an

   (Fs: 43-53 years ago), and selective logging and forest fire (Fc: 21-28
   years ago). The site is located in the central part of Quintana Roo,
   Mexico, where three vegetation patches were delineated according to
   remotely sensed multiespectral imagery. Mean differences between
   vegetation structure properties of each vegetation patch were obtained
   through a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (P < 0.001).
   Species richness, stem density per hectare, and the axis-1 scores of the
   non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of specific composition
   were identified as the vegetation attributes more relevant to
   differentiate the vegetation patches by a multinomial logistic model. Fc
   vegetation patch is characterized by the greatest mean values on
   Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and stem density. The Fs has the
   greatest mean values of canopy height, basal area, and biomass at 80
   percentile, and the Ac vegetation patch has the lowest values of all
   mentioned metrics. The species with the greatest relative importance
   value were: Ac: Bursera simaruba and Piscidia piscipula, Fs: Gymnanthes
   lucida and Manilkara zapota, Fc: G. lucida and B. simaruba. The
   uncertainty associated with the metrics assessed by vegetation patch was
   smaller than the uncertainty of the whole area, because of the efficient
   variability aggregation of the field data. We conclude that
   multiespectral information is a reliable tool for distinguishing
   vegetation patches with specific features, as stem density, specific

Abstract = {{Vegetation fires produce biomass combustion residues, with colour
   varying from dark black char to white mineral ash. The colour-lightness
   of char and ash combustion residues is a qualitative parameter
   describing the post-fire condition of burned areas, and has been
   correlated with the completeness of combustion, fire intensity, and fire
   duration. Researchers have suggested that visual comparison of
   combustion residue samples with a standard grey scale would enable
   reliable combustion residue colour-lightness estimation. This paper
   describes an experiment aimed at assessing if colour-lightness can be
   estimated using a standard grey scale. Fifteen combustion residue
   samples with colour-lightness ranging from black char to white mineral
   ash were collected in the Northern Territory, Australia, and visually
   evaluated by three individuals using a grey scale. The grey-scale scores
   (0-19) were compared with the mean visible (390 to 830 nm) wavelength
   combustion residue reflectance (0-1) measured with a portable
   spectroradiometer. A significant linear relationship between the
   grey-scale scores and the mean visible combustion residue reflectance
   was found (R-2 = 0.816 with a linear fit, R-2 = 0.936 with a
   logarithmic-transformed fit). This finding suggests that combustion
   residue colour-lightness can be assessed in the field using inexpensive
   grey scales, and that this technique is a suitable avenue for future
   research on the field assessment of fire characteristics and effects.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Do endogenous (landscape/vegetation) or exogenous (weather)
   factors control fire severity? During severe fire weather, is there
   convergence in fire severity across rain forest, forests and heathlands
   such that all locations burn with similarly high severity? Are there
   long-term effects of fire severity in temperate crown-fire ecosystems?
   Location: Montane rain forests, eucalypt forests and heaths in the
   temperate climate zone of eastern Australia (Washpool/Gibraltar Range
   National Park).
   Methods: The immediate and longer-term effects of fire weather and
   landscape (terrain, previous fire history and vegetation type) factors
   on fire severity and ecosystem response were measured using remote
   sensing and ground measures of microclimate, productivity and plant
   resprouting at 45 sites.
   Results: Fire weather strongly interacted with terrain, antecedent fire
   history and vegetation type, resulting in complex mosaics of mixed fire
   severity rather than convergence to uniform fire severity. Vegetation
   type influenced the effects of time-since-fire and fire frequency on
   fire severity, suggesting differential fire feedbacks. High fire
   severity left a long-term imprint on total reflectance, ground
   temperatures and productivity of the vegetation, but these effects were
   not uniform across vegetation types. The abundance of resprouting
   species was not strongly affected by fire severity.
   Conclusions: There was evidence for strong weather control of fire
   severity but fire history, terrain and vegetation shape the immediate
   effect due to the contrasting pyrogenic vs pyrophobic nature of the
   vegetation mosaic. The short-term dominance of weather as a driver of
   fire severity is only weakly related to the longer-term ecosystem
   response because of the strong resprouting ability of the canopy
   dominants, even in rain forest. The forest complexes of eastern
   Australia appear highly resilient to high fire severity in both
   structure and floristics, which may influence long-term feedbacks.}},

Abstract = {{From a scientific point of view, the Juan Fernandez islands contain one
   of the most interesting floras of the planet. Although protected as a
   National Park and a World Biosphere Reserve, 400 years of human
   interference have left deep traces in the native plant communities.
   Repeated burning, overexploitation of species, and the introduction of
   animal and plant plagues have taken 75\% of the endemic vascular flora
   to the verge of extinction. In 1997, Chile's national forest service
   (Corporacion Nacional Forestal, CONAF) started an ambitious project,
   whose objective is the recovery of this highly complex ecosystem with a
   socio-ecological focus. Juan Fernandez makes an interesting case, as the
   local people (600 persons) practically live within the park, therefore
   impeding the exclusion of the people from any conservation program.
   Secondly, the relatively small size of the archipelago (100 km(2))
   permits the observation of the effects of whatever modification in the
   ecosystem on small scales in time and space. Thirdly, the native and
   introduced biota are interrelated in such a way that human-caused
   changes in one species population may provoke unexpected results amongst
   other, non-target species. The project mainly deals with the eradication
   or control of some animal and plant plagues, the active conservation and
   restoration of the flora and the inclusion of the local people in
   conservation planning. This article presents the park's general
   problems, the strategy proposed to resolve them as well as some
   preliminary results. This project shows the complexity of the
   conservation activities in practice, with diverse and complex
   interrelations and gaps in ecological knowledge. In this respect, the
   project may well serve as a model for similar programs in other places.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout tropical moist climates, Dicranopteris linearis fernlands can
   develop as a result of rain forest clearance followed by frequent
   burning. In Sri Lanka, D. linearis fernlands are capable of suppressing
   the regeneration of rain forest. field experiments were conducted at
   Sinharaja Man and Biosphere Reserve, a rain forest where fernlands
   occupy substantial areas of the reserve boundary. The experiment's
   objective was to identify methods for initiating forest regeneration in
   fernlands dominated by D. linearis. Three disturbance treatments were
   used to initiate seedling regeneration: clean weed, root removal, and
   till. We hypothesized that increasing the severity of the soil
   disturbance would establish vegetation with higher species richness and
   diversity, greater above-ground dry biomass, and higher percentage cover
   and seedling density. Results indicate only partial support for this
   hypothesis. Dry biomass was greatest in till treatments, the most severe
   soil disturbance. By comparison, species richness and diversity,
   seedling density, and percentage cover were greatest in root-removal
   treatments, though in many instances the differences were not
   significant. The study clearly demonstrated that any kind of soil
   disturbance can facilitate the establishment of herbs, shrubs, and trees
   in a fernland dominated by D. linearis. Results showed that herbs,
   sedges, grasses, and pioneer shrubs represented greater proportions of
   seedling recruits than did pioneer trees. Seedlings of primary-forest
   tree species were nearly nonexistent. In general, results showed that
   soil disturbance can play an important role in site preparation for the
   purpose of initiating non-fern vegetation in fernlands dominated by D.
   linearis.}},

Abstract = {{The Amazon basin is experiencing rapid forest loss and fragmentation,

   positive feedbacks among forest loss, fragmentation, fire, and regional

   increasing the vulnerability of forests to fire. Forest fragments are
   especially vulnerable because they have dry, fire-prone edges, are
   logged frequently, and often are adjoined by cattle pastures, which are
   burned regularly. The net result is that there may be a critical
   ``deforestation threshold{''} above which Amazonian rainforests can no

Abstract = {{Urban sprawl in southern California perpetually threatens native
   shrublands and grasslands, which intrinsically provide both biophysical
   and socioeconomic benefits to society. However, these vegetation types
   are simultaneously prone to high-intensity wildfires that lead to
   enormous damage to human interests. After the southern California
   firestorms of October 2003, new regulations were adopted that increased
   the mandatory vegetation clearance around structures in order to reduce
   fire risk, which may significantly impact the positive benefits that
   grasslands and shrublands provide. To address this apparent conflict, we
   investigated the tradeoffs between societal benefits derived from major
   shrubland, grassland, and woodland vegetation types in southern
   California versus the potential fire behavior associated with each
   vegetation type.
   Two state-of-the-art, geographic information system-based software
   packages were utilized in the analysis, which focused on San Diego
   County, California. For each of the most common grassland, shrubland,
   and woodland vegetation communities in the area, FARSITE was utilized to
   assess potential fire behavior under average and extreme weather
   conditions. The most extreme fire behavior was found in nonnative
   grasslands and scrub oak chaparral communities and least extreme in
   coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) communities. Under Santa Ana wind
   conditions, simulated fires in almost all vegetation types burned over 3
   km into a developed area in < 1 h. CITYgreen was used to quantify air
   pollution removal, carbon sequestration, and stormwater retention for
   each of the vegetation types, but was found to be largely ineffective
   because it calculated no measurable benefits for any non-tree vegetation
   types. To ensure sustainable neighborhoods in the wildland-urban
   interface, diverse stakeholders must create collaborative management
   plans that simultaneously reduce fire risk and maximize societal
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Exclusion of natural surface fires in warm/dry mixed-conifer forests of
   the western U.S. has increased potential for stand-replacing crown fires
   and reduced resilience of these systems to other disturbances, such as
   drought and insect attack. Tree thinning and the application of
   prescribed fire are commonly used to restore more resilient ecological
   conditions, but currently, there is a lack of long-term data with which
   to evaluate restoration treatment effectiveness in forest types where
   resprouting shrubs dominate understory communities. At a mixed-conifer
   site in southwestern Colorado, we compared forest structure and
   understory vegetation responses to three restoration treatments
   (thin/burn, burn, and control) over 10 years in a completely randomized
   and replicated experiment. Forest density, canopy cover, and crown fuel
   loads were consistently lower, and crown base height was higher, in
   thin/burn than burn or controls, but the effects diminished over time.
   Ten years following treatment, >99\% of all plant species within both
   treatments and the control were native in origin. There were no
   differences between treatments in understory richness, diversity, cover,
   or surface fuels, but graminoid cover more than doubled in all
   treatments over the 15-year monitoring period. Similarly, there was more
   than a 250\% increase post-treatment in shrub density, with the greatest
   increases in the thin/burn treatment. In addition, we saw an increase in
   the average shrub height for both treatments and the control, with shrub
   stems >80 cm becoming the dominant size class in the thin/burn
   treatment. Conifer seedling density was significantly lower in thin/burn
   compared with burn and control treatments after 10 years. Taken
   together, these conditions create challenges for managers aiming to
   reestablish natural fire patterns and sustain mixed-conifer forests. To
   limit the dominance of resprouting shrubs and facilitate conifer
   regeneration after overstory thinning and prescribed fire, managers may
   need to consider new or more intensive approaches to forest restoration,
   particularly given current and projected climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The legacy of structural homogenization due to forest management for
   commercial products is a loss of biodiversity. A common policy in many
   European countries is to increase forest diversity by converting managed
   forests to more natural conditions. The aim of this study was to provide
   an early evaluation of the effectiveness of different restoration
   treatments to rehabilitate managed stands in order to increase their
   naturalness. Restoration treatments were imposed on 30-60 years old
   conifer plantations including gap creation with and without added
   deadwood, added deadwood without gaps, gaps plus overburning, and
   controls. We sampled stand structure, understory vegetation and beetles
   before and after treatments on 50 circular permanent plots. Diversity of
   different groups responded differently to treatments with understory
   vegetation diversity increasing the most in gaps with burning, lichens
   in gaps without burning and bryophytes with the addition of dead wood.
   Increased beetle abundance and greater species diversity was a direct
   effect of changed light conditions inside the canopy. Gaps with
   overburning had the greatest recruitment of tree seedlings. Stands that
   were homogeneous pre-treatment increased in heterogeneity in structural
   conditions and microclimatic conditions after treatments and therefore
   richness and abundance of different species groups increased. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Management strategies such as planned burning for fuel reduction can
   help mitigate the effects of wild-fires. The amount of biomass consumed
   is of interest to fire managers as reduction of fuel loads is imperative
   to reducing the risk and extent of a wildfire event. Biomass
   regeneration is also of importance for ecosystem recovery and
   resilience. Pyrogenic carbon (PyC), a product of combustion during both
   planned and unplanned fires, plays a key role in global carbon stores
   and balances. A three-year study of planned burning practices examined
   fires in Lowland temperate Eucalypt forest of south eastern Australia.
   We collected data on overstorey, understorey, coarse woody debris, fine
   litter, PyC and soil across nine sites to determine biomass consumption,
   PyC production and changes in ecosystem carbon during planned burning.
   Lowland forest showed significant recovery of combustible biomass (fine
   litter and understorey) one year after planned fire. Across our sites,
   PyC was produced at a rate of approximately 5\% of the biomass consumed.
   The PyC produced is destined to become part of soil and litter carbon
   and contributes to long-term carbon storage. Planned burning had a
   short-term (<1 year) impact on forest carbon balance, and on reduction
   risk of wildfire and associated losses of biomass carbon, but no
   long-term impact, through deposition of PyC and recovery of biomass. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil water dynamics reflect the integrated effects of climate
   conditions, soil hydrological properties and vegetation at a site.
   Consequently, changes in tree density call have important
   ecohydrological implications. Notably, stand density in many semi-arid
   forests has increased greatly because of fire suppression, such as that
   in the extensive ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests that
   span Much of western USA. Few studies have quantified low soil water
   content varies in low-versus high-density stands both by depth and
   years, or the inter-relationships between water content, stand density,
   and ecohydrological processes. Over a 4-year period, we measured the
   soil water content throughout the soil profiles in both low-density (250
   trees/ha) and high-density (2710 trees/ha) ponderosa pine stands. Our
   results document significantly greater soil water contents in the
   low-density stands over a wide range of conditions (wet, dry, winter,
   summer). We observed substantial differences in water contents at depths
   greater than are typically measured. Our results also show that
   differences in monthly average soil water contents between the low- and
   high-density stands fluctuated between 0.02 and 0.08 m(3) m(-3)
   depending oil the time of year, and reflect a dynamic coupling between
   infiltration and stand evapotranspiration processes. The difference in
   soil water availability between low- and high-density stands is
   substantially amplified when expressed as plant-available water oil a
   per tree, per biomass or per leaf area basis. Our findings highlight
   important ecohydrological couplings and suggest that restoration and
   monitoring plans for semi-arid forests could benefit from adopting a
   more ecohydrological focus that explicitly considers soil water content
   as a determinant of the ecosystem process. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Swidden is an agroforestry system in which woody vegetation is
   regenerated after a period of annual cropping. Associated with most
   forested areas of the tropical world, swidden is often blamed for
   deforestation but it also plays a role in forest conservation. Here, we
   examine the contemporary milpa, a type of swidden agriculture common to
   Latin America and historically used by the Maya people of the lowlands
   of southern Mexico and northern Central America; we focus on one group
   in particular, the Lakandon people of Chiapas. One element of milpa
   agriculture that receives a considerable amount of criticism is the
   burning of cut vegetation after clearing. Fire can have negative effects
   on ecosystems but swidden cultivators are often sophisticated managers
   of fire. Among the benefits of fire use in this setting is its
   contribution to nutrient flow and to long-term soil fertility in the
   form of biochar, charcoal produced by low-temperature pyrolysis in
   agriculture. When properly managed, the milpa cycle can result in
   long-term carbon sequestration and an increasingly fertile anthrosol

   not significantly different among sites (48-89 species), richness
   differed significantly by year. Shannon's index of diversity increased
   by approximately 10\% from the dry year to the wet year on all sites.
   Community composition and plant cover at NOBURN differed significantly
   from the two burned sites in both years in non-metric multidimensional
   scaling ordinations. Increasing duff depth was related to decreased
   plant cover. Two of the three dominant species were different at the
   fire-excluded site compared to the burned sites. We conclude that
   although plant community structure was related to fire history,
   environmental stress and within-stand variability were also important
   drivers. We suggest selecting reference sites in close proximity to the
   site to be restored and using a multi-scale, multi-year, multi-site
   approach to measure reference conditions in ponderosa pine.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plant expansion and infilling into nonwooded rangeland ecosystems
   have been observed worldwide. Such expansion may lead to declines in
   herbaceous understory plant communities and increased fuel loads in
   rangelands. Under the US National Fire Plan, fuel-reduction treatments
   have been implemented over vast expanses of western forest types to
   reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire and restore historical
   ecosystem structure, function, and diversity. The benefits of
   fuel-reduction may, however, also carry inherent ecological risk such as
   promoting non-native species colonization. Here, we compare understory
   plant community responses to three commonly used fuel-reduction
   treatments with seeding applications in an upland pinon (Pinus edulis
   Engelm.)juniper (Juniperus osteosperma {[}Torr.] Little) woodland on the
   Colorado Plateau: 1) mechanical mastication, 2) lop and slash piled then
   burned (pile burn), and 3) lop and scatter followed by a broadcast burn
   (broadcast burn). Data were collected pretreatment (2009) and one
   (2010), two (2011), and six (2015) growing seasons post treatment. We
   found while understory perennial herbaceous plant cover remained low1
   and 2 yr post treatment, it increased by >700\% in all fuel-reduction
   treatment plots six growing seasons post treatment. Furthermore, while
   we observed minor increases in invasive annual grass, Bromus tectorum L.
   (cheatgrass), colonization in 2010 and 2011, there were substantial
   increases in B. tectorum cover by 2015. B. tectorum cover varied among
   treatments with the greatest cover in the unseeded mastication plot at
   nearly 30\%. Seeding applications did not increase overall seed mix
   species cover but enhanced seed mix species richness and, thus, may have
   increased resistance to B. tectorum invasion in seeded treatment plots.
   Our findings offer valuable insights to the ecological consequences of
   fuel-reduction activities in pinon-juniper woodlands through comparison
   of common fuel-reduction treatments and seeding applications and
   highlight differences in understory plant community responses to
   treatments across short to longer time scales. (C) 2017 The Society for

   latewood width (LWI), and latewood proportion (LWPI) series were
   obtained from unburned and burned stands located at four sites along a
   precipitation gradient in southeastern Spain. The combined effect of
   drought in 1994 and 1995 and wildfire in August 1994, negatively
   impacted seasonal growth in the short term (1994-1999 period) at the
   site with higher water availability. At the driest site, however, no
   significant effects were found. We found fewer negative pointer years at
   the wettest burned stand than at the wettest unburned stand during the
   post-fire 1994-2012 period, and the opposite pattern was found at the
   driest site, i.e. more negative pointer years at the driest burned stand
   than at the driest unburned stand. This result indicates that the drier
   sites were more sensitive to cumulative impact of drought and wildfire
   disturbances in the long term, whereas the wetter sites were more
   sensitive in the short term. Our results demonstrate the seasonal growth
   plasticity of Aleppo pine to combined disturbances depends on site water
   availability. This study will help forest managers to implement climate
   change strategies, such as prescribed fires (controlled low-medium
   severity fires) to prevent wildfire hazards more efficiently in Aleppo

Abstract = {{In boreal forests, fire is an important part of the ecosystem that
   greatly influences soil respiration, which in turn affects the carbon
   balance. Wildfire can have a significant effect on soil respiration and
   it depends on the fire severity and environmental factors (soil
   temperature and snow water equivalent) after fire disturbance. In this
   study, we quantified post-fire soil respiration during the non-growing
   season (from November to April) in a Larix gmelinii forest in Daxing'an
   Mountains of China. Soil respiration was measured in the snow-covered
   and snow-free conditions with varying degrees of natural burn severity
   forests. We found that soil respiration decreases as burn severity
   increases. The estimated annual C efflux also decreased with increased
   burn severity. Soil respiration during the non-growing season
   approximately accounted for 4\%-5\% of the annual C efflux in all site
   types. Soil temperature (at 5 cm depth) was the predominant determinant
   of non-growing season soil respiration change in this area. Soil
   temperature and snow water equivalent could explain 73\%-79\% of the
   soil respiration variability in winter snow-covering period (November to
   March). Mean spring freeze-thaw cycle (FTC) period (April) soil
   respiration contributed 63\% of the non-growing season C efflux. Our
   finding is key for understanding and predicting the potential change in
   the response of boreal forest ecosystems to fire disturbance under

Abstract = {{Cistus ladanifer scrublands are widely distributed in the Mediterranean
   basin and represent an early stage of secondary succession following
   major disturbances (e.g., fire). This vegetation type often establishes
   on disturbed and poor soils, thereby improving soil stability in
   stress-prone environments. Fire prevention treatments in these
   scrublands are often recommended to decrease the risk of wildfires, but
   the effect of these treatments on associated soil fungi is not known. We
   studied the effect of distinct fire prevention treatments on soil fungal
   communities associated with C. ladanifer scrublands soils. We used
   Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the ITS1 region on soil samples taken after
   distinct fire prevention treatments that were performed in 27 plots
   belonging to a long-term experiment. Recent fire prevention treatments
   did not affect overall fungal community composition nor fungal
   diversity; however, when analyzing the community according to the
   functional guilds, the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal species was
   significantly lower in burned and 100\% cleared plots, compared with
   control and 50\% cleared plots. In contrast, site history affected
   fungal community composition and richness to a greater extent than the
   fire prevention treatments. Our results show a higher susceptibility of
   ectomycorrhizal species to recent high-intensity fire prevention
   treatments, whereas fire prevention treatments of medium intensity may
   reduce the risk of wildfire and maintain the soil fungal community.}},

Abstract = {{Much research has focused on effects of plant parasites on host-plant

   mistletoe Arcelithobilan vaginatum subsp. cryptopodum (Viscaceae) and

   years and used forest thinning (i.e., competitive release) to manipulate
   host physiological condition. We removed dwarf mistletoe shoots in
   April, before the onset of the growing season, and measured the amount
   of regrowth in the first season after forest thinning (Study I: n=38
   trees; Study II: eta=35 trees). Thinning increased tree uptake of water
   and carbon in both studies, but had no effect on leaf N concentration or
   delta C-13. Mistletoe shoot growth was greater on trees with high uptake
   of water and carbon in thinned stands than trees with low uptake in
   unthinned stands. These findings show that increased resource uptake by

Abstract = {{Post-fire storage of carbon (C) in organic-soil horizons was measured in
   one Canadian and three Alaskan chronosequences in black spruce forests,
   together spanning stand ages of nearly 200 yrs. We used a simple mass
   balance model to derive estimates of inputs, losses, and accumulation
   rates of C on timescales of years to centuries. The model performed well
   for the surface and total organic soil layers and presented questions
   for resolving the dynamics of deeper organic soils. C accumulation in
   all study areas is on the order of 20-40 gC/m(2)/yr for stand ages up to
   similar to 200 yrs. Much larger fluxes, both positive and negative, are
   detected using incremental changes in soil C stocks and by other studies
   using eddy covariance methods for CO2. This difference suggests that
   over the course of stand replacement, about 80\% of all net primary
   production (NPP) is returned to the atmosphere within a fire cycle,
   while about 20\% of NPP enters the organic soil layers and becomes
   available for stabilization or loss via decomposition, leaching, or
   combustion. Shifts toward more frequent and more severe burning and
   degradation of deep organic horizons would likely result in an
   acceleration of the carbon cycle, with greater CO2 emissions from these

Abstract = {{Five years after ecological restoration treatments in a ponderosa
   pine-Gambel oak forest, we re-measured permanent plots to assess changes
   in forest structure and understory vegetation. The treatments were (1)
   thinning to emulate pre-fire-exclusion conditions + prescribed burning
   (FULL restoration), (2) minimal thinning around old trees + burning
   (MIN), (3) burning alone (BURN), and (4) CONTROL. We expected tree
   growth and understory abundance to be greatest in the least dense (FULL)
   treatment. Probably due to drought as well as treatment effects, basal
   area, tree density, and canopy cover declined 3-20\% over the 2000-2004
   time period. Smaller trees and those with greater crown scorch were most
   likely to die. Tree growth differed significantly by species and
   treatment; ponderosa pine grew faster than oak and the FULL treatment
   had the highest pine basal area increment and quadratic mean diameter.
   Understory plant cover and richness differed only slightly by treatment,
   generally varying more with pre-existing conditions and climate. Exotic
   species were present but exotic cover and richness were less than that
   reported after comparable treatments or wildfires in the region.
   Compared to historical reference conditions at the time of the last
   surface fire, 1887, the FULL was less dense and all treatments were
   relatively low in basal area, due to 20th century harvesting of most of
   the large pines. At current growth rates and without additional
   mortality, the FULL treatment may be similar to historical forest
   structures in similar to 20 years. Tree densities in other treatments
   are expected to remain above historical levels. The dynamics of stands
   following alternative restoration treatments are of high interest for
   management because large areas have been proposed for treatment but
   there is limited data on effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Improvement of fallow vegetation can have a positive impact on the

   fertilization can increase biomass and nutrient stocks in the fallow

   strategies: (1) natural fallow (regrowth vegetation) - NF; (2) NF
   vegetation improved with leguminous trees (Sclerolobium paniculatum
   Vogel and Inga edulis Mart.) - IF; and (3) NF vegetation improved with
   leguminous trees plus phosphorus fertilization - IF+P. We quantified
   above-and belowground biomass and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg stocks after 23
   months of fallow. The IF+P increased aboveground (leaf + branch + stem +
   liana) biomass and N, P, Ca, and Mg stocks, compared to NF. Similarly,
   total (aboveground + belowground) biomass and N and P stocks were higher
   for IF+P than for NF. The differences in aboveground biomass between NF
   and improved fallow managements were attributed exclusively to the
   contribution of the tree species enriching fallow vegetation. Phosphorus
   application increased the aboveground biomass accumulation of the
   species for fallow improvement. Improving the fallow vegetation with

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Indo-Malaysian tropical peat swamp forests (PSF) sequester enormous
   stores of carbon in the form of phenolic compounds, particularly lignin
   as well as tannins. These phenolic compounds are crucial for ecosystem
   functioning in PSF through their inter-related roles in peat formation
   and plant defenses. Disturbance of PSF causes destruction of the peat
   substrate, but the specific impact of disturbance on phenolic compounds
   in peat and its associated vegetation has not previously been examined.
   A scale was developed to score peatland degradation based on the three
   major human impacts that affect tropical PSF-logging, drainage, and
   fire. The objectives of this study were to compare the amount of
   phenolic compounds in Macaranga pruinosa, a common PSF tree, and in the
   peat substrate along a gradient of peatland degradation from pristine
   peat swamp forest to cleared, drained, and burnt peatlands. We examined
   phenolic compounds in M. pruinosa and in peat and found that levels of
   total phenolic compounds and total tannins decrease in the leaves of
   M.pruinosa and also in the surface peat layers with an increase in
   peatland degradation. We conclude that waterlogged conditions preserve
   the concentration of phenolic compounds in peat, and that even PSF that
   has been previously logged but which has recovered a full canopy cover
   will have high levels of total phenolic content (TPC) in peat. High
   levels of TPC in peat and in the flora are vital for the inhibition of
   decomposition of organic matter and this is crucial for the accretion of
   peat and the sequestration of carbon. Thus regional PSF flourish despite
   the phenolic rich, toxic, waterlogged, nutrient poor, conditions, and
   reversal of such conditions is a sign of degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience to fire of small mammal communities after large-scale fires
   is through succession, which includes three different main stages. In
   December 1999 a mixed pine forest on Mount Carmel, Israel, was set on
   fire. The burned area was about 15\% of a larger fire occurred in 1989,
   and was monitored for several years. As the two areas were very close (1
   km away) with similar environmental conditions, it was possible to study
   the effects of fire size and location by comparing the results with
   those obtained from the 1989 fire, using similar methods. A total of
   four plots, of 5000 m(2) each, two in the post fire habitat, and two
   unburned control plots were monitored during the years 2000 and 2001.
   In the burned plots relatively fewer small mammals were captured,
   compared with the control plots. While the only monitored species in the
   control plots were the two wood-mice of the genus Apodemus, A.
   mystacinus (75\%) and A. flavicollis (25\%), the species in the burned
   plots were A. flavicollis (66.6\%) and the common spiny mouse Acomys
   cahirinus (33.3\%). These results suggest that after fires of small size
   not all stages of succession appear. ``Islands{''} of forest saved

Abstract = {{Studies of forest change in western North America often focus on
   increased densities of small-diameter trees rather than on changes in
   the large tree component. Large trees generally have lower rates of
   mortality than small trees and are more resilient to climate change, but
   these assumptions have rarely been examined in long-term studies. We
   combined data from 655 historical (1932-1936) and 210 modern (1988-1999)
   vegetation plots to examine changes in density of large-diameter trees
   in Yosemite National Park (3027 km(2)). We tested the assumption of
   stability for large-diameter trees, as both individual species and
   communities of large-diameter trees. Between the 1930s and 1990s,
   large-diameter tree density in Yosemite declined 24\%. Although the
   decrease was apparent in all forest types, declines were greatest in
   subalpine and upper montane forests (57.0\% of park area), and least in
   lower montane forests (15.3\% of park area). Large-diameter tree
   densities of 11 species declined while only 3 species increased. Four
   general patterns emerged: (1) Pinus albicaulis, Quercus chrysolepis, and
   Quercus kelloggii had increases in density of large-diameter trees occur

Abstract = {{Seed predation can cause substantial seed losses and influence plant
   population dynamics, but the impact depends on the extent to which
   populations are limited by seed availability or favorable microsites for
   recruitment. Harvester ants are the dominant post-dispersal seed
   predators in Australia's tropical savannas, and their abundance and
   foraging efficiency, as well as the availability of seed and microsites,
   are affected by fire history. We undertook a predator-exclusion
   experiment to examine the interactive effects of fire history (no fire
   compared with annual burning over 5 years) and seed predation by ants on
   seedling establishment of the dominant savanna tree, Eucalyptus miniata,
   in northern Australia. Despite its large seed size, the rate of removal
   (similar to 20-60\%) was similar or higher than typically reported for
   eucalypts, although it was lower than that recorded for the smaller
   seeds of the co-occurring E. tetrodonta. Seed predation rates were twice
   as high in annually burnt compared to unburnt sites, but there was no
   significant difference in the proportion of seedlings that emerged from
   the initial seed available. Seedling emergence in both regimes was low,
   representing < 7\% of seed available after harvesting. About one-third
   of emergent seedlings were still alive during the middle of the
   following dry season. Our results indicate that seedling recruitment in
   E. miniata is limited by both seed supply and microsite availability.
   However, seed predation by ants reduces the likelihood of seedling
   establishment from low to virtually zero, which suggests that it plays a
   potentially important role in the population dynamics of savanna
   eucalypts.}},

Abstract = {{Rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns in boreal
   ecosystems are changing the fire occurrence regimes (intervals,
   severity, intensity, etc.). The main impacts of fires are reported to be
   changes in soil physical and chemical characteristics, vegetation
   stress, degradation of permafrost, and increased depth of the active
   layer. Changes in these characteristics influence the dynamics of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes. We have studied the changes in
   CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the soil in boreal forest areas in central
   Siberia underlain by continuous permafrost and the possible impacts of
   the aforementioned environmental factors on the emissions of these
   greenhouse gases. We have used a fire chronosequence of areas, with the
   last fire occurring 1, 23, 56, and more than 100 years ago. The soils in
   our study acted as a source of CO2. Emissions of CO2 were lowest at the
   most recently burned area and increased with forest age throughout the
   fire chronosequence. The CO2 flux was influenced by the pH of the top 5
   cm of the soil, the biomass of the birch (Betula) and alder (Duschelcia)
   trees, and by the biomass of vascular plants in the ground vegetation.
   Soils were found to be a CH4 sink in all our study areas. The uptake of
   CH4 was highest in the most recently burned area (forest fire one year
   ago) and the lowest in the area burned 56 years ago, but the difference
   between fire chronosequence areas was not significant. According to the
   linear mixed effect model, none of the tested factors explained the CH4
   flux. The results confirm that the impact of a forest fire on CO2 flux
   is long-lasting in Siberian boreal forests, continuing for more than 50
   years, but the impact of forest fire on CH4 flux is minimal.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes in the abundance of trees and a common shrub, Cornus
   drummondii, were quantified for 15 y (1981-1996) in seven tallgrass
   prairie watersheds in Northeast Kansas. Woody plant responses to
   different fire frequencies and grazing were assessed with a data set
   that included >9000 individuals. Although 15 tree species were included
   in this data set, only four (Juniperus virginiana, Celtis occidentalis,
   Gleditsia triacanthos and Ulmus americana) were sufficiently abundant
   for detailed analysis. Over the 15 y studs tree density increased by
   two- to 10-fold, except in watersheds burned annually where woody,
   plants remained almost completely absent throughout the study. Although
   increased woody plant abundance was expected in watersheds protected
   from fire, tree and shrub density also increased substantially in
   watersheds burned only once in 4 y. An intermediate fire frequency
   (burned every 3-5 y) actually increased the abundance of C. drummondii
   relative to a low fire frequency (burned only once in 15 y). Moreover, a
   severe wildfire in 1991, which affected all watersheds, did not markedly
   reverse this pattern of increase in abundance in most tree species. Four
   years after the addition of native herbivores (Bos bison) to three of
   the long-term experimental watersheds (infrequently and annually burned)
   woody plant abundance increased by four- and 40-fold, respectively,
   compared to corresponding ungrazed watersheds. Thus, the presence of
   large ungulate grazers in tallgrass prairie resulted in a significant
   increase in woody plant abundance. The most parsimonious explanation for
   this phenomenon is that fire intensity and extent was reduced in grazed
   grasslands allowing greater success of woody species.}},

Abstract = {{Decisions regarding forest typology, management and protection are often
   based on the structures of present-day forests, ignoring their
   successional history. Forests growing on kames, eskers and various
   moraine hillocks common in regions with Holocene glaciation are good
   examples of this approach. In Estonia, these forests locally persist as
   fragments of continuous primary forest, but usually they are situated on
   former slash-and-burn areas (bushlands) or reforested agricultural land.
   Our aim was to elucidate the strength of the effect of long-term
   land-use history on the present-day vegetation compositions of mature
   hillock forests and their soil chemistry. It appeared that even the
   mature secondary hillock forests are still distinct from historically
   continuous stands in terms of species composition. We discovered
   connections between stand history and species content in hillock forests
   as well as transformed soil properties. The carbon and nitrogen contents
   in the humus horizons of secondary forests are lower while their
   carbon-nitrogen ratios are higher than in continuous forests. The
   relationship between vegetation and stand history is demonstrated by the
   higher proportions of anthropophytic and apophytic species in the herb
   layer of the secondary forests. The presence of species that are
   tolerant of anthropogenic impact on the secondary hillock forests floor
   can also be partly explained by the effect of different species in the
   tree and shrub layers, gaps in the tree canopy, and the boundary effect
   caused by the small areas of forest patches, neighboring grasslands or
   fields. The extinction debt in secondary communities should also be
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Some warm/dry mixed-conifer forests are at increasing risk of
   uncharacteristically large, high-severity fires. As a result, managers
   have begun ecological restoration efforts using treatments such as
   mechanical thinning and prescribed fire. Empirical information on the
   long-term impacts of these treatments is limited, especially in light of
   potential climate change. We assessed changes in forest structure and
   composition five-years following three alternative restoration
   treatments in a warm/dry mixed-conifer forest: (1) thin/burn, (2)
   prescribe burn, and (3) control. We used the Climate-Forest Vegetation
   Simulator (Climate-FVS) model to quantify potential forest trajectories
   under alternative climate scenarios. Five years following treatments,
   changes in forest structure were similar to initial post-treatment
   conditions, with thin/burn being the only treatment to shift and
   maintain forest structure and composition within historical reference
   conditions. By 2013, the thin/burn had reduced basal area (11.3 m(2)
   ha(-1)) and tree density (117.2 tree ha(-1)) by 56\% and 79\%
   respectively, compared to pre-treatment values. In the burn, basal area
   (20.5 m(2) ha(-1)) and tree density (316.6 tree ha(-1)) was reduced by
   20\% and 35\% respectively, from 2002 to 2013. Mortality of large
   ponderosa pine trees (the most fire-resistant species) throughout the
   duration of the experiment, averaged 6\% in the burn compared to 16\% in
   the thin/burn treatment. Changes five years following treatments were
   largely due to increases in sprouting species. Shrub and sapling
   densities were approximately two to three times higher (respectively) in
   the thin/burn compared to burn and control and dominated by sprouting
   oak and aspen. Under climate simulations, the thin/burn was more
   resilient in maintaining forest conditions compared to burn and control
   which approached meager forest conditions (3-4 m(2) ha(-1)). These
   results indicate that restoration treatment that include both thinning
   and burning can maintain forest integrity over the next few decades. (C)

Abstract = {{Large tracts of land across the western United States have been managed
   over the last century in an effort to increase forage production, reduce
   the risk of wildland fires, and/or restore ecosystem structure and
   function. Yet documentation of this land-treatment history is lacking.
   With the use of data collected from Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
   field offices across the Colorado Plateau, we quantified the number,
   spatial extent, and implementation cost of tree-reduction and seeding
   treatments done in pinon (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus osteosperma,
   Juniperus monophylla, Juniperus scopulorum) woodlands between 1950 and
   2003. Over 247000 hectares of land were treated, corresponding to 6.6\%
   of the pinon-juniper vegetation type within BLM-owned lands.
   Tree-reduction treatments involving chaining, bulldozing, or cabling
   were most prevalent between the 1950s and 1970s, with over 163000 ha of
   land treated with these methods. Prescribed burning became increasingly
   prevalent in the 1980s, with over 43000 ha burned. In more recent years,
   hydroaxe treatments have become common (4 400 ha treated), but to a much
   lesser extent than prescribed burns. Over 60\% of these tree-reduction
   treatments were done in conjunction with revegetation or seeding
   treatments. Implementation costs of these tree-reduction treatments were
   over \$26.7 million, with the hydroaxe treatment having nearly three
   times the cost of implementation than all other tree-reduction
   treatments. The spatial extent of these tree-reduction treatments and
   associated implementation costs highlight the importance of research
   examining the efficacy of these treatments and the potential legacy
   effects. The land-use history reported in this study and the
   accompanying freely accessible on-line database is a useful tool to
   guide research and management objectives and methodology.}},

   The September 1989 fire in Mt. Carmel covered an area of 4 km(2) in the

   Six experimental plots, covering an area of 300-500 m(2) each, were
   established in order to determine the effect of forestry management
   practice on soil erosion after the fire; runoff and sediments were
   collected during and after each rainstorm. Rainfall was measured by two
   recorders and several rain gauges at the study site.
   During the first year following the fire, sediment yield was 100-500
   times higher than on vegetated slopes. Sediment movement was increased
   mainly by the lack of vegetation. Results show that there is a clear
   trend of decrease in sediment yield between the first year and the next
   five. After this period the burnt areas recovered to similar rates of
   erosion as in the unburnt areas. The clearings of burnt logs by machine
   and cable sliding increased the sediment yield in the experimental

   areas of a chopped secondary forest cultivated with cowpea. This work
   was conducted in a rural farming area in the municipality of Ze Doca, MA
   in the agricultural years 2006/2007 and 2007/2008. The preparation of
   the area was carried out with a wheel tractor using the implement ahwi
   FM600. The area was originally planted with maize followed by BRS
   Guariba cowpea for two years. Weed evaluation was carried out 30 and 60
   days after sowing with a rectangle (0.5 x 0.3 m), launched 30 times.
   Evaluation was performed every time, with the aerial parts of the weeds
   being harvested for counting, identification, and drying, to obtain the
   phytosociological indices (frequency, density, dominance index, and
   importance value). The families with the most weed species were
   Cyperaceae (7), Fabaceae (7), Poaceae (6), Malvaceae (5) and Rubiaceae
   (4). In the agricultural years 2006/2007, the species with the highest
   IVI were: Cyperus diffusus, Fimbristylis dichotoma, Spermacoce
   verticillata and Cyperus sp. In the agricultural years 2007/2008, the
   main species were: Digitaria horizontalis, followed by C. diffusus,
   Pavonia cancellata and F. dichotoma. The secondary forest plants
   originated from sprouting presented the highest IVIs in the agricultural
   year 2006/2007 and suffered a drastic reduction in 2007/2008. Thus, it
   can be concluded that progressive cultivation reduces secondary forest
   plant sprouting and increases the herbaceous extract.}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to expectations, some human-modified landscapes are considered
   to sustain both human activities and biodiversity over the long-term.
   Agroforestry systems are among these landscapes where crops are planted
   under native shade trees. In this context, ancient agroforestry systems
   can provide insight into how farmers managed the landscape over time.
   Such insight can help to quantify the extent to which tropical forests
   (especially habitat-specialist trees) are responding to local and
   landscape-level management. Here, we extracted fossil pollen (indicator
   of past vegetation changes) and macroscopic charcoal (indicator of
   biomass burning) from four forest hollows' sedimentary sequences in an
   ancient agroforestry system in Western Ghats, India. We used a
   mixed-modelling approach and a principal components analysis (PCA) to
   determine past trajectories of forest change and species composition
   dynamics for the last 900 years. In addition, we reconstructed the
   long-term forest canopy dynamics and examined the persistence of
   habitat-specialist trees over time. Our results show that the four sites
   diverged to a surprising degree in both taxa composition and dynamics.
   However, despite these differences, forest has persisted over 900 years
   under agricultural activities within agroforestry systems. This
   long-term analysis highlights the importance of different land-use
   legacies as a framework to increase the effectiveness of management
   across tropical agricultural lands.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{Climate projections for the southwestern US suggest a warmer, drier
   future and have the potential to impact forest carbon (C) sequestration
   and post-fire C recovery. Restoring forest structure and surface fire
   regimes initially decreases total ecosystem carbon (TEC), but can
   stabilize the remaining C by moderating wildfire behavior. Previous
   research has demonstrated that fire maintained forests can store more C
   over time than fire suppressed forests in the presence of wildfire.
   However, because the climate future is uncertain, I sought to determine
   the efficacy of forest management to moderate fire behavior and its
   effect on forest C dynamics under current and projected climate. I used
   the LANDIS-II model to simulate carbon dynamics under early (2010-2019),
   mid (2050-2059), and late (2090-2099) century climate projections for a
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) dominated landscape in northern
   Arizona. I ran 100-year simulations with two different treatments
   (control, thin and burn) and a 1 in 50 chance of wildfire occurring. I
   found that control TEC had a consistent decline throughout the
   simulation period, regardless of climate. Thin and burn TEC increased
   following treatment implementation and showed more differentiation than
   the control in response to climate, with late-century climate having the
   lowest TEC. Treatment efficacy, as measured by mean fire severity, was
   not impacted by climate. Fire effects were evident in the cumulative net
   ecosystem exchange (NEE) for the different treatments. Over the
   simulation period, 32.8-48.9\% of the control landscape was either C
   neutral or a C source to the atmosphere and greater than 90\% of the
   thin and burn landscape was a moderate C sink. These results suggest
   that in southwestern ponderosa pine, restoring forest structure and
   surface fire regimes provides a reasonable hedge against the uncertainty
   of future climate change for maintaining the forest C sink.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plant increase in grassy biomes has been widely reported over the
   last century. Increases have been attributed to local drivers associated
   with land use change, such as heavy grazing or fire suppression, or,
   controversially, to global drivers such as increased atmospheric carbon
   dioxide (CO(2)). Here, we report a comparison of woody increase since
   the 1930s in three neighbouring areas with highly contrasting land use
   systems to help distinguish between local and global causes of woody
   increase. Aerial photography was used to measure changes in tree cover
   for three time intervals (1937, 1960, 2004) for three adjacent 25 km2
   sites which remained under radically different tenure (conservation,
   commercial farms, and communal rangeland) over the study period. From
   previous studies on drivers affecting savanna dynamics, we predicted a
   decrease in tree cover for the conservation and communal sites and an
   increase in tree cover at the commercial site. The analyses showed
   highly significant increases in tree cover at all sites. Total tree
   cover increased from 14\% in 1937 to 58\% in 2004 at the conservation
   site, 3-50\% in the commercial ranching area and 6-25\% in the communal
   farming area. Reconstruction of past land use practices showed large
   differences in stocking rates, herbivore species, burning practices,
   human population densities and natural resource harvesting between the
   three sites. These land use differences are reflected in differences in
   woody cover among the three sites in 2004. However, despite major
   differences in land use, tree cover also increased significantly in all
   three areas. This suggests global drivers favouring woody plant increase
   in grassy vegetation regardless of land use practises. In our study area
   the most likely candidates are increased CO(2) and/or atmospheric
   nitrogen deposition.}},

Abstract = {{We tested alternative hypotheses concerning factors affecting early
   forest succession and community composition in deforested and abandoned
   areas invaded by an exotic grass, Saccharum spontaneum, in Panama. We
   hypothesized three barriers to natural regeneration: (1) Saccharum
   competition, (2) seed dispersal limitations, and (3) fire. We measured
   natural free and shrub regeneration in a factorial experiment combining
   distances from adjacent forest. mowing treatments of the Saccharum, and
   a prescribed burn. To determine the applicability of the general model
   of neotropical succession and the nucleation model Of succession to
   species composition of forest regeneration in these anthropogenic
   grasslands in Panama the effect of time since fire and distance to
   remnant vegetation (isolated trees, shrubs, and large monocots) was
   measured.
   Fire significantly affected species composition and decreased species
   richness because most species had either their resprouting ability or
   seed germination inhibited by fire: the few species that had
   regeneration enhanced by fire dominated early successional communities.
   Sites differed in time since fire, ranging from 1 to 4 yr; the
   interaction of site and distance from the forest significantly affected
   community composition and the prevalence of species with different
   dispersal mechanisms and shade tolerance. At recently burned sites.
   light-dependent wind-dispersed species predominated; most were found
   near the forest edge. As time since fire increased, significantly more
   shade-tolerant, larger-animal-dispersed species were recorded, and the
   proximity to and species identity of remnant vegetation became more
   important in affecting species composition of the natural regeneration;
   no significant effect of distance from the forest was found at sites
   that were unburned for three or more years. Our results support both
   successional models; the temporal sequence of species composition
   corresponded to later stages of the general model, while the spatial
   distribution of species followed the nucleation model. Our results
   highlight the importance of effective seed dispersal in structuring
   successional species composition and distribution and in regaining, lost
   diversity resulting from frequent fires ill the Saccharum.}},

Abstract = {{An important goal of restoring fire to upland oak-dominated communities
   that have experienced fire exclusion is restoring groundcover plant
   species diversity and composition indicative of fire-maintained
   habitats. Several studies have shown that fire alone, however, may not
   be sufficient to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, treatment-driven
   declines in rare forest specialists could negate the benefits of
   ecological restoration in these ecosystems. I present the results of an
   experiment examining effects of tornado-generated canopy openings and
   biennial spring burning on groundcover vegetation at an oak-pine forest
   in north Mississippi, USA. Results from four years of monitoring showed
   that species richness and abundance of species indicative of
   fire-maintained open habitats were greater at sites with canopy damage
   than at sites with undamaged canopies, especially in years without
   drought. Annual ruderals increased initially following canopy damage but
   then decreased. Few forest indicator species changed in abundance, and
   the few that did increased. Canopy openings appeared to have a greater
   effect than fire on groundcover vegetation, although some legumes and
   panicgrasses appeared to benefit directly from fire. Results suggest
   that fire restoration treatments must include both canopy openings and
   fire to effectively increase the diversity and distinctiveness of
   groundcover vegetation in mixed oak-pine forests. Prescribed burning
   after years of fire exclusion, by itself, does not constitute effective
   restoration of fire (at least in the short term), but it also does not

Abstract = {{Conservation management under human-induced changes to disturbance
   requires tools that can balance the needs of multiple species with
   different life histories and habitat requirements. Despite this urgent
   conservation need, landscape management typically focuses on single
   species and rarely includes the influence of disturbance-dependent
   vegetation transitions on multiple target species. In this paper, we
   describe a simulation model that achieves these goals, ranking possible
   fire management strategies from the viewpoint of protecting endangered
   coastal Southern Californian wildlife. The model involves the direct and
   indirect effects of fire on four animal species of conservation concern
   (coastal cactus wren, California gnatcatcher, Stephens' kangaroo rat,
   and Pacific pocket mouse) and five vegetation types (grass, coastal sage
   scrub, obligate seeding and resprouting chaparral, resprouting-only
   chaparral, and woodlands). Using historical fire records for the region,
   we predicted spatially-explicit fire frequencies and ignition
   probabilities. For these predictions, we simulated the location and
   extent of fires. Combining fire history and vegetation transition data
   from 1933 to 2003, we specified vegetation change probabilities under
   simulated fire regimes. Fire occurrence in a location altered habitat
   suitability, directly for each of the animal species and indirectly by
   changing the vegetative community. For some open-habitat species, such
   as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and Pacific pocket mouse, fairly frequent
   fire is required to reduce the density of invasive grasses and herbs.
   For other species, such as the coastal cactus wren and California
   gnatcatcher, frequent fire destroys the mature coastal sage scrub on
   which these species depend. The model includes a management component,
   allowing us to rank fire management actions. Over a 50-year time
   horizon, we find that populations of California gnatcatchers and Pacific
   pocket mouse are highly variable, and the pocket mouse is particularly
   prone to decline, despite prescribed burns designed to boost population
   viability. California gnatcatchers were also likely to be extirpated in
   the model, with relatively small extirpation risks for the cactus wren
   and Stephens' kangaroo rat. Despite conflicting requirements with
   respect to fire and differing life history traits among the four
   animals, we identified a beneficial strategy for our four target
   species, namely, controlling fire in coastal sage scrub. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Effects of incursion of water and nutrients from agricultural land on
   adjoining native Banksia woodland were examined near Moora, Western
   Australia, by using a 100-m-wide belt transect from the paddock edge
   into virgin bush. Transect zones 0 20, 20 50 and 100 300 m inwards were
   designated as `hedge', `transition' and `inner bush', respectively.
   Numbers of species of native woody taxa increased from 28 to 42 and
   plant densities increased from 2200 to 14 900 plants per hectare from
   hedge through transition to inner bush, while collective total standing
   biomass (above and below ground) of woody species decreased from 157 to
   32 t dry matter per hectare. Data for nutrient contents of this total
   biomass indicated that total nutrient loads in respect of calcium,
   potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, copper and sodium were
   closely related to relative amounts of biomass in the three zones, but
   hedge vegetation was appreciably enriched in nitrogen but depleted in
   manganese and chlorine compared to inner bush. Diversity indices
   indicated differential responses of species to agricultural influence.
   The dominant tree species, Banksia prionotes, represented 91, 87 and
   58\% of the total biomass of woody taxa in hedge, transition and inner
   bush, respectively. Growth ring analyses of basal trunk xylem indicated
   that this seeder species had recruited after a hot burn in 1963
   coincident with land clearing. Since then, annual trunk-area increments
   in hedge trees have been consistently much greater than in transition
   and bush. Net annual productivities, dry matter allocation profiles and
   current leaf areas of B. prionotes showed that the average hedge tree
   weighed 167 kg total dry matter and was currently increasing at 11.9 kg

Title = {{Limitations to recovery following wildfire in dry forests of southern
   Colorado and northern New Mexico, USA}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming is contributing to increases in wildfire activity
   throughout the western United States, leading to potentially
   long-lasting shifts in vegetation. The response of forest ecosystems to
   wildfire is thus a crucial indicator of future vegetation trajectories,
   and these responses are contingent upon factors such as seed
   availability, interannual climate variability, average climate, and
   other components of the physical environment. To better understand
   variation in resilience to wildfire across vulnerable dry forests, we
   surveyed conifer seedling densities in 15 recent (1988-2010) wildfires
   and characterized temporal variation in seed cone production and
   seedling establishment. We then predicted postfire seedling densities at
   a 30-m resolution within each fire perimeter using downscaled climate
   data, monthly water balance models, and maps of surviving forest cover.
   Widespread ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) seed cone production
   occurred at least twice following each fire surveyed, and pulses of
   conifer seedling establishment coincided with years of above-average
   moisture availability. Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii) seedling densities were higher on more mesic sites and
   adjacent to surviving trees, though there were also important
   interspecific differences, likely attributable to drought and shade
   tolerance. We estimated that postfire seedling densities in 42\% (for
   ponderosa pine) and 69\% (for Douglas-fir) of the total burned area were
   below the lowest reported historical tree densities in these forests.
   Spatial models demonstrated that an absence of mature conifers
   (particularly in the interior of large, high-severity patches) limited
   seedling densities in many areas, but 30-yr average actual
   evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit limited densities on
   marginal sites. A better understanding of the limitations to postfire
   forest recovery will refine models of vegetation dynamics and will help
   to improve strategies of adaptation to a warming climate and shifting
   fire activity.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning and mechanical thinning are used to manage fuels
   within many western North American forest ecosystems, but few studies

   of burning and thinning on the microhabitat associations of flying
   squirrels. Across pretreatment stands, the probability of flying
   squirrel capture increased with decreasing distance to a perennial creek
   and increasing litter depth. The probability of flying squirrel capture
   also was greater with increased canopy cover in thinned stands and
   increased litter depth in burned stands. Greater canopy cover may
   provide protection from predators, thicker litter layers may harbor a
   greater abundance of truffles, a primary food of northern flying
   squirrels, and creeks may provide squirrels with food sources, drinking
   water and nest trees. Results from this study underscore the need for

Abstract = {{Invasive non-native grasses can greatly alter habitat structure. Land
   managers use fire to reduce invasive grass infestations, a strategy
   which is intended, at least in part, to reduce the impact of wildfires
   on fauna. The response of fauna to fire in invasive grass environments
   may be complex. To examine the responses of fauna to fire and invasive
   grass we compared mammal richness and abundance in a group of 24
   replicated sites in north Queensland, Australia. Our sites were
   characterised by native kangaroo grass, native black spear grass, or
   invasive, non-native grader grass, and we surveyed them at three times
   in relation to fire. First, when they had remained unburnt for 2 years
   (pre-burnt), just after burning (post-burnt), and up to 15 months after
   burning (revegetated, i.e., the grass had naturally regrown). Therein,
   we monitored vegetation structure and mammal richness, abundance and
   assemblage composition. The lowest overall mammal abundances occurred in
   sites revegetated after fire (40-55 \% lower abundances in revegetated
   compared to pre-burnt sites), but rufous bettongs (Aepyprymnus
   rufescens) and tropical short-tailed mice (Leggadina lakedownensis)
   increased in abundance following fire. Abundance of eastern chestnut
   mice (Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) and common planigales (Planigale
   maculata) decreased after fire, but returned with returning grass cover.
   We detected a gradual decline in northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon
   macrourus) over the course of the study, with no recovery. We found no
   evidence that mammals showed stronger responses in invasive than native
   grasses after fire. Mammal responses to fire were distinctive, some
   species were more abundant following fire, some less, and some species
   returned to their prior abundances. Thus, in tropical savannahs, a
   naturally fire-prone system, overall mammal abundance, but not richness,
   decreased after fires, in both native and non-native grass, but the
   responses of individual species varied greatly. Decisions to burn
   invasive grasses for biodiversity conservation should include an
   awareness of the likelihood of enhancing certain species while
   discouraging others.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a gain-loss approach to estimating the dynamics of the dead

   only emissions of methane and nitrous oxide were accounted in greenhouse

   fuel accumulation equation. This modification includes the mean
   post-fire residue and accounts for losses from both fire and
   decomposition and for gains from grass production, tree litter fall and
   the death of trees. We apply the approach to a case study in western
   Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia, in which the fire regime has
   been changed and the project has achieved recognised abatement of
   methane and nitrous oxide emissions. The carbon sequestration in the
   dead organic matter is similar to 85 times the annual emissions
   abatement in this project area and when expressed as an annual rate is
   similar to 3.5 times the abatement. We also show that the emissions
   abatement has previously been underestimated owing to an inability to

   the models of dead organic matter to include seasonal dynamics in

Abstract = {{A survey of both urban and rural communities in five Local Government
   Areas (LGA) of Oyo State in Nigeria showed that 76\% of households
   depend on fuelwood for cooking. The total annual wood consumption for
   fuelling by bread bakers, food sellers and in domestic cooking was 5984
   metric tons for the region. The sawmills in the study area also convert
   79 889 metric tons of wood yearly into boards of different grades. Total
   wood consumption outstrips the quantity of wood extracted from the
   forests. The balance of over 60 000 metric tons of wood is sourced from
   neighbouring forest locations. The quantity of wood harvested for
   various purposes did not show a significant difference (p < 0.05) among
   the five LGAs. However, a significant difference at p > 0.05 existed in
   the quantity of wood actually consumed in the various LGAs. Moreover,
   the number of trees cut down outstrips the number of trees planted with
   a significant difference ( p > 0.05) between the mean quantity of wood
   removed from the forests and the mean quantity replaced by
   reforestation. The practice in the study area was that of
   `cut-eight-plant-one' which is at variance to the much publicized

   Ogbomoso in Nigeria have not shown positive disposition to tree
   planting. It therefore suggests scientific tree conservation strategies
   aimed at improved burning of fuel wood and maximized use of timber
   products as complementary efforts to enforced tree planting for

Abstract = {{We present landscape simulation results contrasting effects of changing

   dynamics and forest characteristics under three future climate
   projections representing a range of potential future conditions using
   the FireBGCv2 model. Under the future climate scenarios with moderate
   warming (>2 degrees C) and moderate increases in precipitation (3-5\%),
   model simulations resulted in 1.2-4.2 times more burned area, decreases
   in forest cover (10-44\%), and reductions in basal area (14-60\%). In
   these same scenarios, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) decreased in basal
   area (18-41\%), while Douglasfir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) basal area
   increased (21-58\%). Conversely, mild warming (< 2 degrees C) coupled
   with greater increases in precipitation (12-13\%) suggested an increase
   in forest cover and basal area by mid-century, with spruce and subalpine
   fir increasing in abundance. Overall, we found changes in forest tree
   species compositions were caused by the climate-mediated changes in fire
   regime (56-315\% increase in annual area burned). Simulated changes in
   forest composition and fire regime under warming climates portray a
   landscape that shifts from lodgepole pine to Douglas-fir caused by the

   organic soils, and analyzed total carbon, nitrogen, bases and major
   anions in water extracts. There was a significant correlation between
   water-extracted organic carbon (WEOC) and total carbon (kg m(-2)) in
   area basis, implying that the quantity of total carbon was a major
   factor in WEOC production. WEOC correlated negatively with pH,
   indicating strong control by organic horizons (organic solute leaching)
   on soil acidity and base cation dynamics. The sum of water extractable
   base cations was also correlated significantly to total carbon,
   indicating that cations can be released through organic matter
   decomposition. Organic horizons in troughs in burned plots released
   greater amounts of Ca, Mg and K than those in mounds, probably due to
   greater content of organic matter as a cation source. Anions including
   nitrate and phosphate and WEOC also accumulated in trough depressions,
   due probably to organic matter degradation. The contrasting distribution

Abstract = {{Extreme drought stress and associated bark beetle population growth
   contributed to an extensive tree mortality event in California, USA,
   resulting in more than 129 million trees dying between 2012 and 2016.
   Although drought is an important driver of this mortality event, past
   and ongoing fire suppression and the consequent densification of forests
   may have contributed. In some areas, land management agencies have
   worked to reduce stand density through mechanical treatments and
   prescribed fire to restore forests to less dense, more open conditions
   that are presumably more resilient to disturbance and changing climate.
   Here, we evaluate if stand structural conditions associated with treated
   (e.g., thinned and prescribed burned) forests in the Sierra Nevada of
   California conferred more resistance to the bark beetle epidemic and
   drought event of 2012-2016. We found that, compared to untreated units,
   treated units had lower stand densities, larger average tree diameters,
   and greater dominance of pines (Pinus), the historically dominant trees.
   For all tree species studied, mortality was substantially greater in
   climatically drier areas (i.e., lower elevations and latitudes). Both
   pine species studied (ponderosa pine {[}Pinus ponderosa] and sugar pine
   {[}Pinus lambertiana]) had greater mortality in areas where their
   diameters were larger, suggesting a size preference for their insect
   mortality agents. For ponderosa pine, the tree species experiencing
   greatest mortality, individual-tree mortality probability (for a given
   tree diameter) was significantly lower in treated stands. Ponderosa pine
   mortality was also positively related to density of medium- to
   large-sized conspecific trees, especially in areas with lower
   precipitation, suggesting that abundance of nearby host trees for insect
   mortality agents was an important determinant of pine mortality.
   Mortality of incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) and white fir (Abies
   concolor) was positively associated with basal area, suggesting
   sensitivity to competition during drought, but overall mortality was
   lower, likely because the most prevalent and effective mortality agents
   (the bark beetles Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. ponderosae) are
   associated specifically with pine species within our study region. Our
   findings suggest that forest thinning treatments are effective in
   reducing drought-related tree mortality in forests, and they underscore
   the important interaction between water and forest density in mediating
   bark beetle-caused mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Woodfuels are the most heavily used energy source in sub-Saharan Africa.
   We analyzed the ecological impacts and modes of access of five user
   groups (domestic consumers, gin distillers, brick manufacturers,
   charcoal producers, and tea companies) drawing biomass energy from
   natural forests in western Uganda. While domestic consumers use the most
   species for fuelwood (> 50), their consumption is likely sustainable
   because they generally harvest fast-growing species from fallows on
   their own land or their neighbors'. Charcoal producers prefer old-growth
   hardwood species and are responsible for the greatest loss of natural
   forests. They access forests by finding landholders who, either
   willingly or through coercion, allow trees on their lands to be cleared.
   The impact of charcoal production is exacerbated by a license system
   that undervalues natural forests and rewards rapid harvests across large
   areas. The tea industry consumes mainly eucalyptus wood (Eucalyptus
   spp.) from corporate plantations, but they indirectly create pressure on
   natural forests by hiring immigrants who subsequently settle in and
   clear forest remnants. If such practices continue, forest remnants will
   soon be exhausted, leaving Kibale National Park as the last natural
   forest in the region. Forest remnants are a vital source of water,
   medicinal plants, and energy for local citizens and to protect them from
   over-exploitation, policy makers should target the charcoal and tea
   industry for reform. Support for local land management institutions
   governing access to fallows and successional forests will inevitably
   enhance the policy interventions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Forests are being clearcut over extensive areas of western North

   still largely unknown. Evaluation of resilience is hampered by the short
   history of logging, lack of long-term experiments and methodological

   repeatedly after treatment between 1981 and 2008 in 16 permanent
   research installations in three biogeoclimatic zones: Engelmann
   Spruce-Subalpine Fir, Interior Cedar-Hemlock and Sub-Boreal Spruce. We

   plant functional types representing groups of plants that behave in
   similar ways and/or produce similar ecological outcomes. These plant
   functional types, along with taxonomic analysis of diagnostic and
   indicator species, were then used to evaluate plant community response
   to disturbance. Twenty years post-treatment, species diversity increased
   in all zones and plant abundance was greatest in the Interior
   Cedar-Hemlock. Cover of understory plant functional types associated

   Response patterns varied by zone and with time. Understory species
   diagnostic of mature forests were present in all zones by year 20, but
   we identified indicator species sensitive to slashburning or requiring
   more time for recovery, including white-flowered rhododendron
   (Rhododendron albiflorum) and devil's club (Oplopanax horridus).
   Overall, loss of compositional or functional diversity following harvest
   and site remediation was not detected, suggesting that montane and
   subalpine forests in British Columbia are resilient to this treatment.
   However, because these forests can be slow to recover from disturbance,
   the post-disturbance assessment window of this study may not have been
   long enough to detect diminishment of ecosystem resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Forest mastication is frequently used as a fuel reduction treatment
   aimed at minimising severe wildfires in fire prone areas worldwide. In
   recent years, mastication of non-commercial burned trees has become
   common practice in NW Spain, as a way of providing cover on the burned
   soil and preventing erosion, However, little is known about the possible
   effects on soil conservation and vegetation recovery. In this study, 20
   experimental plots were established in a Pinus sylvesuis L. plantation
   affected by a crown fire that caused moderate-high soil burn severity in
   the summer of 2016. Immediately after the fire, burned trees were
   masticated in half of the plots, while burned trees were left standing
   in the other half of the plots during the first two years after the
   fire. The objectives of the study were to determine how mastication
   affected soil erosion, soil physical properties (soil penetration
   resistance, soil shear strength, soil bulk density) and vegetation
   recovery. The masticated material covered 43\% of the burned soil.
   During the first year after wildfire + mastication, precipitation was
   lower than the annual mean level in the area, and the mean soil loss in
   the untreated burned soils (5.7 Mg ha(-1)) was not significantly
   different from that in the masticated plots (5.0 Mg ha(-1)). Mastication
   did not have any detrimental effects on either the soil physical
   properties analysed or on the regeneration of natural vegetation. The
   results indicated that in addition to mastication of severely burned
   non-commercial trees, extra mulch should be applied to reduce the risk
   of soil erosion. Mastication after wildfire is not detrimental to soil
   conservation. No advantage was obtained by leaving the standing burned
   trees on site, in relation to reducing soil erosion or enhancing
   vegetation recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is widely used as a management strategy in grasslands to maintain

   The impacts of burning on invertebrates in South Africa remain poorly
   understood. A study was initiated in spring 2005 to determine the impact
   of a fast hot burn on ground-dwelling spider assemblages in a grassland
   habitat in the central Free State. Pitfall traps were set out at six
   sites in the reserve, with three sites each in the burnt and unburnt
   areas, to sample spiders over a 12-month period. A total of 5 253
   spiders were collected, representing 33 families and 120 species. Spider
   abundance was significantly lower in the burnt (n = 1 956) than unburnt
   sites (n = 3 297), and burnt sites had, on average, considerably fewer
   species than unburnt sites. The dominant families in the burnt sites
   were Lycosidae (29.5\%), Gnaphosidae (16.9\%), Ammoxenidae (9.6\%) and
   Zodariidae (5.7\%), whereas Ammoxenidae (22.7\%), Lycosidae (20.6\%),
   Gnaphosidae (15.3\%) and Amaurobiidae (10.2\%) dominated the unburnt
   sites. Of the nine most abundant families collected, only Caponiidae
   were more abundant in the burnt than unburnt sites. Our data suggest
   that fast-burning hot spring fires cause a considerable initial
   post-fire decline in spider abundance, and have a negative influence on
   the abundance as well as the resistance of assemblages to disturbances
   other than fire (e.g. rain). However, most of the dominant families had
   abundances comparable to unburnt areas within a year post-burn.}},

Abstract = {{Herbicides are used in savanna to control tree and shrub density,

   However, the concomitant effects on biodiversity and landscape

   monitored tree and shrub dynamics and eventual landscape functionality
   in response to tree-killing over 7-8 years at two open eucalypt woodland
   sites in central Queensland. Paddocks denuded of trees using herbicide
   or not so treated were subject to three differing grazing pressures by
   cattle. Similarly treated but ungrazed sets of plots were subjected to
   either regular spring burns or were rarely burnt.
   Tree and shrub growth and seedling recruitment were slightly affected by
   grazing pressure but regular spring burns minimised recruitment of minor
   woodland species and reduced the population of original saplings and
   seedlings that survived the herbicide. Few eucalypt seedlings emerged
   from soil surface samples taken each spring in any treatment, despite
   the presence of flowering trees in half the treatments. Capture and
   retention of resources, particularly rainfall and nutrients, were
   slightly improved by killing the trees, and worsened by grazing. We
   conclude that killing trees with herbicide at these sites did not

   to assess physical and chemical properties of soils, disturbance,

   analysis of soil data revealed a soil moisture and soil chemistry
   gradient. Trees and saplings were sparse (mean of 37 and 81 per ha) and
   most common in dry and dry-mesic sites, while regeneration was abundant
   (mean of 110,100 stems per ha) and well-distributed across the soil

   reflect physiological tolerances of soil moisture extremes plus
   variation in fire regime caused by differences in soil moisture. Forest

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nearly a century of fire suppression has changed fundamental aspects of
   the structure and functioning of fire-adapted forests throughout the
   western U. S. Prescribed fire is increasingly used to restore forest
   structure and reduce surface fuels with limited consideration of its
   consequences for biological diversity. In this study, we used more than
   two decades of data from permanent plots in mixed-conifer forests of
   Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, to explore changes
   in plant diversity and abundance following reintroduction and repeated
   use of fire. Data on stand structure, fuel loading, fire severity and
   heterogeneity, and the richness and abundance of major growth forms were
   collected on 51 plots representing one of three treatments: control,
   first-entry burn, and second-entry burn. Understories showed distinct
   compositional changes over time in first-and second-entry burns. Burned
   plots supported more than twice as many species as controls 10 yr after
   treatment; first-entry plots showed a nearly threefold increase in
   richness by year 20. Burned plots supported four to five times as many
   shrub species as controls 5-10 yr after burning. Total plant cover
   (dominated by perennial forbs and shrubs) increased in first-entry
   plots, but did not differ from controls until 20 yr after treatment.
   Following second-entry, cover did not change through final sampling
   (year 10). Nonnative species were rare, occurring in only three plots at
   low abundance. Higher severity fires led to greater numbers of species
   and to greater plant cover. Species richness was not correlated with
   burn heterogeneity. Long-term observations suggest that reintroduction
   of fire in previously unmanaged forests can gradually enhance the
   diversity and abundance of understory species. Repeated
   burning-necessary to achieve structural and fuel-reduction
   objectives-does not appear to have a detrimental effect on plant
   diversity and may enhance the distributions of species that are
   adversely affected by fire exclusion. If fire is to play an important
   role in restoration, however, it will need to be maintained as a
   frequent and spatially dynamic process on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the effect of prescribed fire on

   interspace) and 2 tree cover types (intermediate and high) in August
   2001., before a spring prescribed burn conducted in May 2002, and then
   following the prescribed burn in August 2002. Infiltration experiments
   were used to calculate saturated hydraulic conductivity (K{[}theta(s)])
   rates, and water drop penetration times were determined to evaluate the
   development of water-repellent soils. Infiltration rates before the burn
   were greater at the low elevation than at the mid and high-elevation
   study sites because of differences in measured soil texture. Before
   burning, the infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (K{[}theta(s)]) rates measured on interspace and shrub canopy microsites
   were less than on tree canopy microsites at the midelevation study site
   (2 225 m). Following burning, the intermediate tree cover tree canopy
   microsites had greater infiltration rates than interspace microsites;
   all other microsites were similar to each other. No significant
   differences in K(Os) rates existed among the microsites after burning.
   However, on the higher elevation study site before the burn, the
   interspace microsites had final infiltration rates less than the tree
   canopy microsites, and burning caused no deviation from this trend.
   Saturated hydraulic conductivity rates at the high elevation did not
   differ by microsite before the burn, but after burning interspace
   microsites had K(theta(s)) rates less than tree canopy microsites.

Abstract = {{Wildfires play a key role in shaping the boreal forest landscape, yet
   the response of wildlife to the patchy mosaics they create is poorly

   (9600 ha) in the boreal mixedwood forest of north-eastern Alberta. In
   the spring of 1995 and 1996 we estimated abundance of songbirds in four
   areas, each with four replicate sites: unburned patches within the fire
   (Isolates); burned patches (Burns); patches that had been clear-cut
   prior to burning by wildfire (Cut-Burns); and the unburned, continuous
   forest adjacent to the burn (Peripherals). We also sampled shrub-based
   arthropods with sweep-nets at each site. To investigate the role of
   Isolates, we compared them to Peripherals and to Burns. We compared
   Cut-Burns to Burns to examine the effect of logging prior to burning. In
   general, Isolates supported higher numbers of species and individuals
   than Peripherals, mainly due to higher numbers of aerial-foraging birds.
   Isolates and Burns had similar species richness and abundance, but Burns
   supported more aerial foragers while Isolates had more foliage gleaners.
   Cut-Burns generally supported fewer individuals than Burns, in
   particular fewer shrub-nesters, aerial foragers, and neotropical
   migrants. More bird species reached their highest densities in Burns
   than in any other area. Songbird species richness and abundance were
   positively related to dry arthropod biomass, with Burns and Isolates
   having the highest arthropod biomass. These patterns indicated that, 5-6
   years post-burn, the patchy mosaic created by this wildfire supported
   more species than the mature forest surrounding the fire. Clear-cut
   logging prior to burning resulted in a diminished songbird community

Abstract = {{Classic regeneration cuttings retaining trees at harvest (shelterwood

   long-term effects of retention harvests on stand development, with a
   focus on both regeneration and retention tree responses. The postharvest
   understory treatments (understory removed and broadcast burned) effects
   were also evaluated. Results indicate that overstory retention results
   in relatively long-term regeneration growth reduction. Compared with the
   overstory-free condition (clearcut), the shelterwood with reserves and
   group selection overstories both reduced the regenerated cohort's basal
   area, 63 and 44\%, respectively. Postharvest burning increased
   regeneration stem density and also decreased mean regenerated tree size;
   consequently, these treatment effects were somewhat offsetting, as they
   produced a zero net difference in regenerated cohort basal area.
   Considerable regeneration growth reduction associated with retained
   overstory trees in the shelterwood with reserves was partially mitigated
   by understory vegetation protection measures that conserved advance
   regeneration. We conclude that both retention treatments somewhat
   suppressed regenerated cohort development, but that these impacts were
   lessened when overstory trees were aggregated and cuttings were in
   groups, rather than regularly dispersed through the cutting unit.}},

Abstract = {{Desert grasslands, which are very sensitive to external drivers like
   climate change, are areas affected by rapid land degradation processes.
   In many regions of the world the common form of land degradation
   involves the rapid encroachment of woody plants into desert grasslands.
   This process, thought to be irreversible and sustained by biophysical
   feedbacks of global desertification, results in the heterogeneous
   distribution of vegetation and soil resources. Most of these shrub-grass
   transition systems at the desert margins are prone to disturbances such
   as fires, which affect the interactions between ecological,
   hydrological, and land surface processes. Here we investigate the effect
   of prescribed fires on the landscape heterogeneity associated with shrub
   encroachment. Replicated field manipulation experiments were conducted
   at a shrub-grass transition zone in the northern Chihuahuan desert (New
   Mexico, USA) using a combination of erosion monitoring techniques,
   microtopography measurements, infiltration experiments, and isotopic
   studies. The results indicate that soil erosion is more intense in
   burned shrub patches compared to burned grass patches and bare
   interspaces. This enhancement of erosion processes, mainly aeolian, is
   attributed to the soil-water repellency induced by the burning shrubs,
   which alters the physical and chemical properties of the soil surface.
   Further, we show that by enhancing soil erodibility fires allow erosion
   processes to redistribute resources accumulated by the shrub clumps,
   thereby leading to a more homogeneous distribution of soil resources.
   Thus fires counteract or diminish the heterogeneity-forming dynamics of
   land degradation associated with shrub encroachment by enhancing
   local-scale soil erodibility.}},

   sites suggest that clumping increases only slightly after fire. The
   degree of clumping in the A. laubenfelsii sites, suggested that fire

   disturbances are infrequent but may result in blow-down of large
   individuals within both maquis and forest. All of the individuals
   blown-down during the study had been previously fire-scarred. Around
   tree blow-downs, seedling and sapling densities can be high. This likely
   reflects both the low dispersability of Araucaria seeds and enhanced
   moisture from the shading of the adult, when it was alive. Disturbance
   by fire and wind play an important role in the regeneration dynamics and
   spatial pattern of these species in maquis in New Caledonia.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple disturbance regimes are increasingly common as novel
   anthropogenic disturbances are added to existing natural disturbances.
   However, it is generally unknown whether simultaneous or sequential
   effects of different forms of disturbance are predictable from the
   independent effects of each disturbance. This study examines the
   short-term effects of sequential disturbance by mineral sand-mining
   followed by fire in a forest community in south-eastern Australia. Four
   combinations of disturbance were sampled: unburned mined, burned mined,
   unburned forest (unmined) and burned forest (unmined, with between-fire
   interval matching the disturbance interval between mining and fire of
   the burned mined treatment). All combinations were sampled approximately
   12 months following fire on the burned sites. The impact of fire after
   mining depended on disturbance interval. Sites burned 0.5-2.4 years
   since mining had fewer native vascular plant species than unburned mined
   sites of the same mined age, whereas sites with 10-16 years or 20-26
   years between mining and fire had greater native species richness than
   unburned mined sites of the same age. Burning 20-26 years after mining
   brought native species richness within the range of burned forest. For
   both unmined and mined sites native seedling densities increased with
   burning, and with longer disturbance intervals. Weed species richness
   and weed seedling densities were greater on mined sites than in forest,
   and burning mined sites elevated weed seedling densities further,
   particularly for short intervals. Both disturbance interval and fire
   intensity are likely to have contributed to these results, as intensity
   on mined areas increased with interval, and at 20-26 years post-mining
   was equivalent to unmined forest. These results suggest that fire could
   be used to promote rehabilitation of these mined areas after at least 10
   years, but should be excluded from earlier stages of post-mining
   regeneration. However, other sources of spatial and temporal variability
   should be considered in addition to interval and intensity, as variation
   among mined areas was correlated with post-fire weather conditions and
   available weed sources. Finally, the combined effects of mining and fire
   could not be predicted from knowledge of the disturbances operating
   separately, indicating that effects of multiple disturbance may be
   synergistic rather than additive.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
   have been increasing and greatly affecting global climate and
   socio-economic systems. Actively growing forests are generally
   considered to be a major carbon sink, but forest wildfires lead to large
   releases of biomass carbon into the atmosphere. Aboveground forest
   biomass carbon (AFBC), an important ecological indicator, and
   fire-induced carbon emissions at regional scales are highly relevant to
   forest sustainable management and climate change. It is challenging to
   accurately estimate the spatial distribution of AFBC across large areas
   because of the spatial heterogeneity of forest cover types and canopy
   structure. In this study, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data,
   Landsat, and Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools
   Project (LANDFIRE) data were integrated in a regression tree model for
   estimating AFBC at a 30-m resolution in the Utah High Plateaus. AFBC
   were calculated from 225 FIA field plots and used as the dependent
   variable in the model. Of these plots, 10\% were held out for model
   evaluation with stratified random sampling, and the other 90\% were used
   as training data to develop the regression tree model. Independent
   variable layers included Landsat imagery and the derived spectral
   indicators, digital elevation model (DEM) data and derivatives,
   biophysical gradient data, existing vegetation cover type and vegetation
   structure. The cross-validation correlation coefficient (r value) was
   0.81 for the training model. Independent validation using withheld plot
   data was similar with r value of 0.82. This validated regression tree
   model was applied to map AFBC in the Utah High Plateaus and then
   combined with burn severity information to estimate loss of AFBC in the
   Longston fire of Zion National Park in 2001. The final dataset
   represented 24 forest cover types for a 4 million ha forested area. We
   estimated a total of 353 Tg AFBC with an average of 87 MgC/ha in the
   Utah High Plateaus. We also estimated that 8054 Mg AFBC were released
   from 2.24 km(2) burned forest area in the Longston fire. These results
   demonstrate that an AFBC spatial map and estimated biomass carbon
   consumption can readily be generated using existing database. The
   methodology provides a consistent, practical, and inexpensive way for
   estimating AFBC at 30-m resolution over large areas throughout the
   United States. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural landscapes characterized by heavy disturbance regimes were
   displaced in Europe by managed cultural landscapes over the past
   centuries. The associated loss of biological legacies, such as dead or
   dying trees, has exposed numerous saproxylic species to high risks of
   extinction. In contrast, extensive wilderness forests in Northern
   Mongolia have been sustained owing to significant cultural differences.
   Here we used saproxylic beetle abundance data gathered during two
   sampling campaigns in the Mongolian taiga to address whether (1) the
   saproxylic beetle fauna of the Mongolian taiga is comparable to that of
   European boreal forests, (2) fires are a natural disturbance regime,
   indicated by the occurrence of many pyrophilous species, and (3) species
   rare in Europe are also rare in the Northern Mongolian wilderness. Of
   191 saproxylic beetle species identified, 150 (79 \%) were also found in
   Europe. The high number of pyrophilous beetle species (20) indicated
   that natural species communities are well adapted to this disturbance
   regime. The species rarity in Germany was significantly positively
   correlated with the species rarity in Finland, but the species rarity in
   these two countries was negatively correlated with that in the Mongolian
   wilderness. Our results indicated that wilderness areas with natural
   disturbances provide biological legacies important for rare species.
   Therefore, exploitation of the unique, remaining natural landscapes of
   the Palaearctic wilderness areas should be stopped. Moreover, we urge
   conservationists to expand controlled burning for restoration at relict

Abstract = {{Animal species diversity is often associated with time since
   disturbance, but the effects of disturbances such as fire on functional
   diversity are unknown. Functional diversity measures the range,
   abundance, and distribution of trait values in a community, and links
   changes in species composition with the consequences for ecosystem
   function. Improved understanding of the relationship between time since
   fire (TSF) and functional diversity is critical given that the frequency
   of both prescribed fire and wildfire is expected to increase. To address
   this knowledge gap, we examined responses of avian functional diversity
   to TSF and two direct measures of environmental heterogeneity, plant
   diversity, and structural heterogeneity. We surveyed birds across a
   70-year chronosequence spanning four vegetation types in southeast
   Australia. Six bird functional traits were used to derive four
   functional diversity indices (richness, evenness, divergence, and
   dispersion) and the effects of TSF, plant diversity and structural
   heterogeneity on species richness and the functional diversity indices
   were examined using mixed models. We used a regression tree method to
   identify traits associated with species more common in young vegetation.
   Functional richness and dispersion were negatively associated with TSF
   in all vegetation types, suggesting that recent prescribed fire
   generates heterogeneous vegetation and provides greater opportunities
   for resource partitioning. Species richness was not significantly
   associated with TSF, and is probably an unreliable surrogate for
   functional diversity in fire-prone systems. A positive relationship
   between functional evenness and structural heterogeneity was common to
   all vegetation types, suggesting that fine-scale (tens of meters)
   structural variation can enhance ecosystem function. Species more common
   in young vegetation were primarily linked by their specialist diets,
   indicating that ecosystem services such as seed dispersal and insect
   control are enhanced in more recently burnt vegetation. We suggest that
   patchy prescribed fire sustains functional diversity, and that
   controlled use of patchy fire to break up large expanses of mature
   vegetation will enhance ecosystem function.}},

   carbon stocks: A knowledge synthesis}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{466}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Almost half of the total organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is
   stored in forest soils. By altering rates of input or release of C from
   soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in
   forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the
   influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C
   stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C
   stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are
   unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of
   primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks,
   particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior
   to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting,
   generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the
   forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting
   whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil
   disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly
   in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may
   outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an
   overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest
   ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C
   occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and
   accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species,
   with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and
   broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There
   is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively
   affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree
   species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a
   stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management
   of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C
   stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores,
   reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of
   plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil
   C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce
   soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For
   each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest
   research to address the gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Pinon-juniper woodlands (Pinus edulis, Juniperus osteosperma, and J.
   scopulorum) and petran chaparral communities (Quercus gambelii,
   Amelanchier utahensis, Cercocarpus montanus, and other tall shrub
   species) cover much of the Colorado Plateau in the southwestern United
   States. Long-term fire history and successional dynamics are poorly
   understood in these vegetation types. Therefore, we lack a suitable
   historical context for interpreting the ecological significance of large
   fires and dramatic vegetative changes that have occurred recently in
   these ecosystems. For example, in Mesa Verde National Park, located in
   southwestern Colorado, four large intense fires in the last 50 years
   have threatened significant cultural and natural resources and have
   caused debate over whether Mesa Verde's fire regime has been
   significantly altered by human activities in the last century.
   In this study, we dated prehistoric fires in shrublands dominated by
   Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) by aging stems that resprouted after fire.
   We mapped the spatial extent of all fires >10 ha that occurred during
   the last 150 years within a 6600-ha, shrub-dominated portion of Mesa
   Verde National Park. The turnover time (years required to burn an area
   equal to the entire shrubland zone) was similar to 100 years under the
   ``natural{''} fire regime of the mid- to late 19th century. Fire
   occurrence was reduced substantially during the first half of the 20th
   century, but the current fire regime (since about 1950) appears to be
   similar to that of the 19th century-despite a continuing policy of total
   fire suppression.
   The ``natural{''} fire turnover time in pinon-juniper woodlands of Mesa
   Verde is about 400 years. A sharp boundary exists between pinon-juniper
   woodlands at slightly lower elevations in the southern portion of the
   park and petran chaparral at slightly higher elevations in the north.
   This pattern is explained, in part, by more extensive fires in the
   northern area, which favor resprouting shrubs and eliminate the
   fire-sensitive pinon and juniper. The less frequent occurrence of large
   fires, and resulting persistence of woodland in the southern portion of
   the park, may be due in part to natural barriers to fire spread (cliffs
   and sparsely vegetated slopes) to the south and west of the
   pinon-juniper woodlands.
   Our findings demonstrate that fire frequency and extent in Mesa Verde
   during the last 50 years have not been greatly different from the
   ``natural{''} fire regime of the late 1800s. Therefore, the recent large
   fires in the park, and the vegetative responses to those fires, appear
   to be within the historic range of variation for this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis slip.
   occideiffalis Hook.) in the northern Great Basin has resulted in the
   wide-scale conversion of sagebrush-steppe communities to juniper
   woodlaods. Prescribed fire and mechanical cutting are the 2 main methods
   used to remove juniper and restore sagebrush steppe. Mechanical
   treatments commonly leave cut juniper on site. Disadvantages of leaving
   cut juniper are the increased fuel hazard potential for increased
   establishment and growth of invasive species. This study evaluated the
   response of herbaceous plants to winter burning of cut western juniper.
   Vegetation response was compared among 2 burning treatments (burning
   trees the first whiter after cutting and burning the second winter after
   cutting), a control (cut-unburned juniper), and the interspace between
   cot trees. To minimize fire impacts to herbaceous perennials, cut trees
   were burned in the winter when soils and ground litter were frozen
   and/or soils were at field capacity Only felled trees were burned, as
   fire did not carry into interspaces or litter mats around western
   juniper stumps. We hypothesized that winter season burning would
   increase herbaceous perennials and would reduce cheatgrass establishment
   when compared to the cut-unburned control. After 10 years, total
   herbaceous and perennial grass cover-was 1.5- to 2-fold greater,
   respectively, in burned treatments compared to cut-unburned controls.
   Perennial grass density was 60\% greater in the burned treatments than
   in the cut-unburned treatment and the interspace. Cheatgrass cover was
   twice as great in the control than in the 2 burn treatments and the

Abstract = {{Wildfires burned 24,254ha of critical habitat designated for the
   recovery of the threatened Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii)
   in southern Nevada during 2005. The proliferation of non-native annual
   grasses has increased wildfire frequency and extent in recent decades
   and continues to accelerate the conversion of tortoise habitat across
   the Mojave Desert. Immediate changes to vegetation are expected to
   reduce quality of critical habitat, yet whether tortoises will use
   burned and recovering habitat differently from intact unburned habitat
   is unknown. We compared movement patterns, home-range size, behavior,
   microhabitat use, reproduction, and survival for adult desert tortoises
   located in, and adjacent to, burned habitat to understand how tortoises
   respond to recovering burned habitat. Approximately 45\% of home ranges
   in the post-fire environment contained burned habitat, and numerous
   observations (n=12,223) corroborated tortoise use of both habitat types
   (52\% unburned, 48\% burned). Tortoises moved progressively deeper into
   burned habitat during the first 5 years following the fire, frequently
   foraging in burned habitats that had abundant annual plants, and
   returning to adjacent unburned habitat for cover provided by intact
   perennial vegetation. However, by years 6 and 7, the live cover of the
   short-lived herbaceous perennial desert globemallow (Sphaeralcea
   ambigua) that typically re-colonizes burned areas declined, resulting in
   a contraction of tortoise movements from the burned areas. Health and
   egg production were similar between burned and unburned areas indicating
   that tortoises were able to acquire necessary resources using both
   areas. This study documents that adult Mojave desert tortoises continue
   to use habitat burned once by wildfire. Thus, continued management of
   this burned habitat may contribute toward the recovery of the species in
   the face of many sources of habitat loss. Published 2015. This article

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Upland hardwood forest managers are increasingly burning during the
   growing-season in hopes of improving wildlife habitat and attaining or
   accelerating other restoration goals, highlighting the need for research
   addressing how season of burning affects wildlife, including breeding
   birds. We used 1-ha strip transects in nine units before (2011) and
   after (2013-2016) treatments to experimentally assess how breeding birds
   respond to early growing-season (26 April 2013; GSB) and dormant-season
   (5 March 2014; DSB) burns, and controls (C). Burn effects on forest
   structure were minor and transitory, regardless of burn season. Burns
   did not affect overstory or midstory tree basal area or density; shrub
   cover did not significantly differ among treatments, but within GSB and
   DSB it decreased for 1-2 years post-burn. A trend of reduced leaf litter
   depth immediately following both burn treatments was apparent, and
   recovery was rapid. Percent canopy cover decreased slightly in GSB
   within four years post-burn. Total bird species richness and density did
   not differ among treatments or years, and no treatment x year
   interaction effects were detected. A treatment effect was detected for
   one of the 10 species tested; Red-bellied woodpecker density was greater
   in GSB than C in 2013 and 2015. No treatment x year interaction effect
   was detected for any tested species. Density of birds within the tree-,
   cavity-, and shrub and midstory-nesting guilds were not detectably
   affected by either burn treatment, but ground-nester density was lower
   in GSB and DSB than C in 2014. Our results indicate that single,
   low-intensity burns, regardless of burn season, are not an effective
   tool in creating suitable forest structure for disturbance-dependent
   breeding bird species, or changing breeding bird community composition.
   In the short-term, substantial forest overstory reduction by timber
   harvests or high-severity burns will likely be required to improve
   forest conditions for disturbance-dependent species, and to increase
   species richness and abundance of breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{Austrostipa compressa, a native ephemeral of southwest Western Australia
   was stimulated to germinate under a range of temperatures, in the
   presence of light, and exposure to smoke-water. This combination of
   environmental cues results in winter-maximum germination in immediate
   postfire and disturbed-soil environments of this Mediterranean-type
   climate. In contrast, Ehrharta calycina, an introduced perennial grass
   from southern Africa that has invaded Banksia woodlands, germinated
   under a wide range of temperature and light conditions, but showed no
   promotive response to smoke-water. Although A. compressa seeds tolerated
   heat shock better than E. calycina, the self-burial mechanism of A.
   compressa seeds ensures protection from fire. High-intensity fire could
   have a greater impact on E. calycina, as the seeds of this species tend
   to accumulate in the top of the soil profile where they are more
   susceptible to high temperatures. Although seeds off. calycina are more
   susceptible to high temperatures, survival of mature individuals by
   postfire resprouting ensures continued survival in native woodlands.
   Estimates of soil seed bank densities showed extreme variability, but
   some recently burnt areas of the Yule Brook Botany Reserve contained up
   to 8000 seed m(-2) of A. compressa and nearly 75 000 seeds m(-2) off.
   calycina. Viable soil seed bank densities of A. compressa are reduced
   with time-since-last fire, but areas of greater than 45 years since the
   last fire, still contained up to 119 seeds m(-2). In both species, only
   about half their soil seed bank germinates following fire, thus ensuring
   the potential for later recruitment. Massive soil seed populations of E.
   calycina in native Banksia woodlands pose a major problem to management
   of this plant community type.}},

Abstract = {{Forest management fire and herbivores are the major factors affecting
   regeneration of deciduous trees in boreal forests. In a large-scale
   experiment we manipulated the use of prescribed burning the level of
   green-tree retention and the presence of moose (Alces alces L.) and hare
   (Lepus timidus L. and Lepus europaeus Pallas) to study their effects on
   early regeneration of three native pioneer tree species i.e. rowan
   (Sorbus aucuparia L.) aspen (Populus tremula L.) and silver birch
   (Betula pendula Roth). Green-tree retention enhanced survival of all
   tested tree species. Prescribed burning enhanced the survival rate of
   birch and rowan but aspen survival was only enhanced by burning on
   clearcuts and areas with 50 m(3)/ha of retention trees. Excluding moose
   enhanced rowan growth and birch survival. Aspen growth and survival was
   enhanced when both moose and hare were excluded. Seedlings were most
   frequently browsed on clearcuts and most seedling mortality was caused
   by voles or hare. At low densities the effect of moose on pioneer trees
   may be smaller than that of other herbivores or the fire-management
   regime. Considering the large number of species depending on pioneer
   trees the results support the use of tree retention and fire as useful
   management alternatives not only to promote biodiversity but also to
   enhance regeneration of deciduous trees and reduce herbivore damage.}},

Abstract = {{Depending on the severity of the fire, forest fires may modify
   infiltration and soil erosion processes. Rainfall simulations were used
   to determine the hydrological effects of fire on Andisols in a pine
   forest burned by a wildfire in 2007. Six burned zones with different
   fire severities were compared with unburned zones. Infiltration, runoff
   and soil loss were analysed on slopes of 10\% and 30\%. Forest floor and
   soil properties were evaluated. Unburned zones exhibited relatively low
   infiltration (23 and 16 mm h(-1) on 10\% and 30\% slope angles,
   respectively) and high average runoff/rainfall ratios (43\% and 50\% on
   10\% and 30\% slope angles, respectively), which were associated with
   the extreme water repellency of the forest floor. Nonetheless, this
   layer seems to provide protection against raindrop impact and soil
   losses were found to be low (8 and 16 g m(-2) h(-1) for 10\% and 30\%
   slope angles, respectively). Soil cover, soil structure and water
   repellency were the main properties affected by the fire. The fire
   reduced forest floor and soil repellency, allowing rapid infiltration.
   Moreover, a significant decrease was noted in soil aggregate stabilities
   in the burned zones, which limited the infiltration rates. Consequently,
   no significant differences in infiltration and runoff were found between
   the burned and the unburned zones. The decrease in post-fire soil cover
   and soil stability resulted in order-of-magnitude increases in erosion.
   Sediment rates were 15 and 31 g m(-2) h(-1) on the 10\% and 30\% slope
   angles, respectively, in zones affected by light fire severity. In the
   moderate fire severity zones, these values reached 65 and 260 g m(-2)

   enhances nitrogen availability in an Illinois oak-dominated forest}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{411}},
Pages = {{82-89}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Controlled burning is a common management technique used to control
   invasive understory plants and promote oak regeneration throughout the
   prairie-forest ecotone and across eastern deciduous forests. However,
   prescribed burning effects on oak forest and woodland soils remain
   largely unknown. As fire has significant and often disproportionate
   impacts on soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), evaluating
   the impacts of repeated, low-intensity prescribed burning on oak forest
   soil is fundamental for understanding and predicting burning effects on
   vegetation dynamics and ecosystem functions. The goal of this study was
   to evaluate relative changes in soil C and nutrient dynamics in response
   to three decades of annual, low-intensity controlled burning in an
   oak-dominated forest in northern Illinois. We found that annual burning
   increased soil organic and inorganic N availability and microbial
   biomass N. Burning also increased N cycling rates and N-degrading enzyme
   activity in the 5-15 cm soil layer. Surprisingly, annual burning had
   little effect on soil P pools and fluxes, likely due to intrinsically
   high soil P availability. Similarly, though total soil C increased,
   burning did not alter available C concentrations, microbial biomass C,
   C-degrading enzyme activities, or C mineralization rates. As such,
   annual burning created a positive feedback on inorganic N production,
   altering relationships among C, N, and P. In contrast with management
   goals, controlled burning often fails to enhance oak proliferation or
   decrease the abundance of invasive plants. As Eastern forests were
   historically N-limited, our study suggests a potential mechanism behind
   these restoration outcomes: frequent, low-intensity burning may produce
   soil environments that are incompatible with restoration goals.}},

   burn, and control treatments were applied to 10 ha units; each treatment
   was replicated three times. Dwarf mistletoe was found in ponderosa pine
   and/or Douglas-fir in all units prior to treatment. Stand infection
   severity was low to moderate, and severely infected trees were the
   largest in the overstory. Thinning produced the greatest reductions in
   tree stocking and mistletoe severity. Burning reduced stocking somewhat
   less because spring bums were relatively cool with spotty fuel
   consumption and mortality. Burning effects on vegetation were enhanced
   when combined with thinning; thin + burn treatments also reduced
   mistletoe severity in all size classes. Stand growth simulations using
   the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) showed a trend of reduced

   similar to infected basal area; however, treatment effects diminished

Abstract = {{There is limited information on how velvet leaf blueberry (Vaccinium
   myrtilloides Michx.) responds to fires and existing small forest gaps
   associated with narrow linear disturbances. We measured the effects of
   narrow forest linear gaps from seismic lines used for oil and gas
   exploration versus adjacent (control) forests across a fire severity (\%
   tree mortality) gradient on the presence, abundance (cover), vigor
   (height), and berry production of Vaccinium myrtilloides in recently
   (five-year) burned jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forests near Fort
   McMurray, Alberta. Presence was greatest in forests that experienced low
   to moderately-high fire severities with declines at high fire severity.
   Abundance did not differ among seismic lines or adjacent forest, nor did
   it differ along a fire severity gradient. In contrast, vigor and berry
   production were greater on seismic lines compared to adjacent forests
   with fire severity positively affecting berry production, but not plant
   vigor. After controlling for changes in plant cover and vigor, berry
   production still increased with fire severity and within seismic lines
   compared with adjacent forests. Our findings suggest that narrow gaps
   from linear disturbances and fire severity interact to affect the
   fecundity (berry production) and growth (height) of Vaccinium

Abstract = {{This study proposes a reconstruction of the past development of a forest
   stand submitted to long-term variations of snow levels. As of the 19th
   century, a gradient in tree-growth forms developed in a post-fire
   shoreline stand. This expansion was marked by three stages. (1) Prior to
   1845, the effects of fire (between 1806 and 1826) increased the exposure
   stress on surviving trees, which started to develop irregular growth
   forms in response to niveo-eolian erosion. Post-fire regeneration
   expanded progressively toward the inner part of the island. (2)
   Afterwards (1845-1880), severe winter and summer conditions were marked
   by numerous unsuccessful snow-air interface breakthroughs, as shown by
   frequent loss of apical dominance. (3) Since 1880, the densification of
   above-snow tree structures contributed to the overaccumulation of snow
   that caused many injuries to trees (branch tearing, stem bending). The
   frequent damage (since the 1900s) and the raised level of above-snow
   erosional features (loss of apical dominance) indicate that increasing
   forest density merely exacerbated the rising trend of snowfalls in the
   forest studied. This trend, demonstrated earlier in the northern areas
   of the forest-tundra, was not yet documented at the limit of the
   southern boreal forest.}},

Abstract = {{Summer wildfires and autumn torrential rainfall are the background to
   the development of one of the most important environmental problems in
   the western Mediterranean area: erosion, degradation of soil structure
   and desertification. These processes especially affect plant communities
   located in old abandoned fields where woody sprouters are practically
   absent. Under these conditions, post-fire vegetation cover is dependent
   on obligate seeders and, in the short term, especially on resprouting
   perennial grasses. Brachypodium retusum is a rhizomatous perennial grass
   that plays a particularly important role in the resilience of these
   fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystems. In Mediterranean gorse shrublands,
   during the first few years after a fire, this species represents 90\% of
   plant cover and biomass. The recurrence or severity of fire does not
   seem to affect the regeneration capacity of this species. After two
   years, even under high fire frequency (12 years) and high fire severity
   (>400degreesC), it recovers both cover and biomass. Nevertheless, this
   species, a key factor in the control of soil erosion, is extremely
   affected by erosion processes. A single extreme rainfall event reduces
   the rate of regeneration of B. retusum by about 50\%. The reduction in
   the protective cover of this species may result in degradation and
   eventual self-induced degrading process in the ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Novel fire regimes are expected in many boreal regions, and it is
   unclear how biogeochemical cycles will respond. We leverage fire and
   vegetation records from a highly flammable ecoregion in Alaska and
   present new lake-sediment analyses to examine biogeochemical responses
   to fire over the past 5300 years. No significant difference exists in
   delta C-13, \% C, \% N, C : N, or magnetic susceptibility between
   pre-fire, post-fire, and fire samples. However, delta N-15 is related to
   the timing relative to fire (chi(2) = 19.73, p < 0.0001), with higher
   values for fire-decade samples (3.2 +/- 0.3\%) than pre-fire (2.4 +/-
   0.2\%) and post-fire (2.2 +/- 0.1\%) samples. Sediment delta N-15
   increased gradually from 1.8 +/- 0.6 to 3.2 +/- 0.2\% over the late
   Holocene, probably as a result of terrestrial-ecosystem development.
   Elevated delta N-15 in fire decades likely reflects enhanced terrestrial
   nitrification and/or deeper permafrost thaw depths immediately following
   fire. Similar delta N-15 values before and after fire decades suggest
   that N cycling in this lowland-boreal watershed was resilient to fire
   disturbance. However, this resilience may diminish as boreal ecosystems
   approach climate-driven thresholds of vegetation structure, permafrost
   thaw and fire.}},

Title = {{Effects of drought and fire on resprouting capacity of 52 temperate
   Australian perennial native grasses}},
Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},

Volume = {{221}},

Pages = {{1424-1433}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{It remains uncertain how perennial grasses with different photosynthetic
   pathways respond to fire, and how this response varies with stress at
   the time of burning. Resprouting after fire was examined in relation to
   experimentally manipulated pre-fire watering frequencies. We asked the
   following questions: are there response differences to fire between C-3
   and C-4 grasses? And, how does post-fire resprouting vary with pre-fire
   drought stress?
   Fifty-two perennial Australian grasses (37 genera, 13 tribes) were
   studied. Three watering frequencies were applied to simulate increasing
   drought. Pre-fire tiller number, tiller density, specific leaf area and
   leaf dry matter content were measured as explanatory variables to assess
   response.
   Most species (90\%) and individuals (79\%) resprouted following
   experimental burning. C-4 grasses had higher probabilities of surviving
   fire relative to C-3 grasses. Responses were not related to phylogeny or
   tribe. High leaf dry matter content reduced the probability of dying,
   but also reduced the re-emergence of tillers.
   Post-fire tiller number increased with increasing drought, regardless of
   photosynthetic type, suggesting that drought plays a role in the ability
   of grasses to recover after fire. This has implications for
   understanding the persistence of species in landscapes where fire
   management is practiced.}},

Title = {{Post-fire epicormic branching in Sierra Nevada Abies concolor (white
   fir)}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-35}},
Abstract = {{In California's mixed-conifer forest, which historically had a regime of
   frequent fires, two conifers, Sequoiadendron giganteum and Pseudotsuga
   menziesii, were previously known to produce epicormic sprouts from
   branches. We found epicormic branching in a third mixed-conifer species,
   Abies concolor, 3 and 4 years after a wildfire in the central Sierra
   Nevada Mountains of California. Sprouting occurred only from the boles.
   We investigated (1) whether the degree of crown loss and the extent of
   epicormic branching were independent; and (2) whether epicormic
   branching differed by tree size. The vertical extent of epicormic
   foliage increased with increasing severity of crown loss. There was a
   significantly greater proportion of large diameter-class (> 50 cm
   diameter at breast height {[}dbh]) trees with epicormic branching than
   small/medium diameter-class (25-50 cm dbh) trees. These results suggest
   large diameter Abies concolor may survive high levels of crown loss,
   aided by crown replacement through epicormic branching, but that
   reiterative green foliage may not appear for up to 3 years after fire
   damage. If this response is widespread, it would suggest some `dying'
   trees logged under current salvage guidelines could survive, and that
   higher-intensity fire may substantially reduce the density of small
   post-fire suppression white fir, while retaining many larger overstory
   trees.}},
