Abstract = {{Wildfires are prevalent in grasslands and shrublands. The objective of
   this study is to provide land managers with a general overview, by
   assessing the main impacts of wildfire, including those on plant
   communities (e.g., secondary succession and species invasion), soil
   characteristics (e.g., water repellency (hydrophobicity), aggregation
   and structure stability, and contents of organic carbon and nutrients),
   and surface processes (e.g., ash deposition, ground surface clogging,
   water runoff, soil erosion, hillslope debris flow, and dry ravel).
   Additionally, the study discusses the effects of livestock grazing on
   the functioning of post-fire grasslands and shrublands. Although mesic
   regions are mentioned, this review focuses on drylands. The
   comparatively low-to-moderate fuel loads that characterize grasslands
   and shrublands generate wildfires of relatively moderate intensity,
   resulting in moderate burn severity. Yet, it seems that because of
   decreased soil aggregate stability following burning, the hoof action of
   livestock that access burnt lands shortly after the fire increases the
   shearing and detachment of mineral material from the ground surface;
   this increases soil erodibility, with the possible risk of accelerated
   land degradation. The review ends with an assessment of general
   implications for environmental sustainability and health, and provides
   recommendations on wildfire control in rangelands, and on restoration of
   burnt lands.}},

Abstract = {{Fire frequency and burn severity may increase in pine forests in the
   Mediterranean Basin under the warmer and drier climate projected for
   this region. Our study aims to evaluate the role of fire frequency and
   burn severity in the post-fire recruitment and development of
   Mediterranean serotinous pines under different environmental conditions.
   Two pine forests representing contrasting climatic conditions and soil
   types that support serotinous pines in the Iberian Peninsula and
   affected by large wildfires in summer 2012, were selected. In these two
   study sites, we determined the number of wildfires between 1978 and 2012
   and the burn severity of the last fire (2012 at both sites) through the
   dNBR spectral index. Three and four years after the wildfires, we
   sampled the density, cover and height of pine seedlings and the cover of
   woody understory species in 1296 1 m(2) ( )plots. The results indicated
   that the density and cover of pine seedlings was low after two fires
   combined with high severities, as well as after three fires, regardless
   of burn severity. Seedling recruitment after three fires was
   particularly threatened in the most arid study site (0.01 seedlings
   m(-2)), resulting in low seedling cover (0.01\%). Seedling height
   decreased with fire frequency in both study sites, and with burn
   severity owing to fire-induced shifts in soil fertility and
   microclimatic conditions. There was a significant negative effect of the
   cover of woody understory species on the recruitment and cover of pine
   seedlings. Our results suggest that the effects of increasing fire
   frequency and severity on pine regeneration may be aggravated under arid
   conditions. Additionally, this study encourages forest managers to avoid
   the occurrence of frequent crown fires in order to prevent the loss of
   serotinous pine forest, and provides useful information to predict the
   scenarios in which post-fire restoration actions would be helpful.}},

Abstract = {{In many fire-prone ecosystems, seed germination is triggered by heat
   shock, smoke, ash and charred wood. However, few studies concerning the
   effect of these fire products on the germination of tropical and
   subtropical species exist. We assessed the effect of fire products and
   their interactions on seed germination in 12 species that frequently
   grow in burned areas of pine-oak and mixed forest in a mountainous
   subtropical area. Each species was exposed to a predetermined treatment
   of heat shock, which was optimised in accordance with a previous study.
   For smoke treatments, seeds were immersed in smoke water, whereas for
   ash treatments, 1.5 g of ash was added to the incubation medium.
   Germination increased in 92\% of the species in response to the products
   of fire. Both the smoke water and the ash treatments promoted
   germination in four species that had permeable seed covers and
   physiological dormancy. Six species with physical dormancy required both
   heat shock and smoke water or ash to break dormancy. Our results
   indicate that seed germination response to fire products depends on the
   species and/or dormancy type. The germination response to the fire
   products varied between species; therefore, fire products may influence
   the species composition in post-fire regeneration. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Over short and long timescales, wildfires can be an important cause of
   hydrological and geomorphological change. Mediterranean rivers are part
   of a fire-prone and high-energy environment in which the timing of major
   storms in relation to fire influences the impact on fluvial systems;
   accordingly, the identification of major sources, stores and fluxes of
   sediments is essential for providing more effective post-fire management
   strategies. In this study, caesium-137 and excess lead-210 were used as
   tracers to quantify the proportional contributions of fine sediment from
   hillslope surface and channel bank sources to suspended sediment and
   channel bed deposits before the impact of a forest wildfire in Na
   Borges, a Mediterranean groundwater-dominated river. It also compared
   burnt and unburnt spatial sources of sediment within a single catchment
   and the extent to which burnt material was transported downstream. The
   study focused on two small and steep sub-catchments, where just one of
   the catchments was partially affected by a wildfire. The pre-fire
   dynamics indicated that surface soils were the main sediment source in
   these ephemeral creeks. Post-fire sediment dynamics were characterised
   by a single flood event with a short recurrence interval (i.e. return
   period ca. <1 year). Sediment generated from the burnt area contributed
   12\% on average to bed-stored sediments within the burnt catchment,
   which reduced downstream to 5\% along the main channel of the Na Borges
   River. The findings demonstrate the potential for using fallout
   radionuclide tracers to understand the wider impacts of wildfires on
   fluvial environments located outside of the burn area. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Climate, vegetation and humans act on biomass burning at different
   spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we used a dense network of
   sedimentary charcoal records from eastern Canada to reconstruct regional
   biomass burning history over the last 7000 years at the scale of four
   potential vegetation types: open coniferous forest/tundra, boreal
   coniferous forest, boreal mixedwood forest and temperate forest. The
   biomass burning trajectories were compared with regional climate trends
   reconstructed from general circulation models, tree biomass
   reconstructed from pollen series, and human population densities. We
   found that non-uniform climate, vegetation and human drivers acted on
   regional biomass burning history. In the open coniferous forest/tundra
   and dense coniferous forest, the regional biomass burning was primarily
   shaped by gradual establishment of less climate-conducive burning
   conditions over 5000 years. In the mixed boreal forest an increasing
   relative proportion of flammable conifers in landscapes since 2000 BP
   contributed to maintaining biomass burning constant despite climatic
   conditions less favourable to fires. In the temperate forest, biomass
   burning was uncoupled with climatic conditions and the main driver was
   seemingly vegetation until European colonization, i.e. 300 BP. Tree
   biomass and thus fuel accumulation modulated fire activity, an
   indication that biomass burning is fuel-dependent and notably upon
   long-term co-dominance shifts between conifers and broadleaf trees.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain pine beetle (MPB) has become an invasive forest pest of mature
   pine in western North America as it spreads beyond its former endemic
   range. Management actions such as timber harvest can reduce the spread
   of MPB but may affect species of conservation concern like woodland
   caribou. Our goal was to inform MPB management within caribou ranges by
   exploring the impacts of MPB on caribou habitat-focusing on terrestrial
   lichens, an important winter food for caribou. We evaluated differences
   in lichen cover among four MPB management actions: timber harvest,
   wildfires, leaving MPB killed trees as-is, and single-tree cut-and-burn
   control. We found little evidence that leaving MPB killed trees as-is or
   controlling MPB using single-tree cut-and-burn impacted lichen cover.
   However, we found that lichen cover was lower in timber harvested and
   burned areas compared to intact undisturbed forest but only 10 to 20
   years post-disturbance, respectively. Our results suggest that despite
   short-term reductions in lichen cover, using timber harvesting and
   prescribed burns to control MPB may balance management needs for MPB
   while maintaining lichen cover over time. However, using timber
   harvesting and prescribed burns to manage MPB is likely to have
   detrimental population-level effects on caribou by increasing the
   proportion of disturbed habitat and thus predators within caribou
   ranges. Among the four management actions that we evaluated, the
   cut-and-burn control program balances the need to limit the spread of
   MPB while also limiting negative impacts on caribou food. Our work
   addresses some of the challenges of managing competing forest and
   ecosystem values by evaluating the consequence of forest pest management
   actions on an important food resource for a species-at-risk.}},

Abstract = {{Wildland fires are one of the major causes of ecosystem degradation,
   especially in semiarid climates, where the erosion hazard is high. The
   identification of potential erosion zones is typically difficult as it

   methodology based on remote sensing and GIS techniques, which permits
   speedy identification of erosional areas in a semi-automatic way, tested
   in a large burn scar in south-eastern Spain. Inputs were slope, aspect,
   and fire severity. In order to obtain the latter a new method has been
   proposed, based on the difference in NDVI between two images (acquired

   Forest Intervention Priority map (FIP) is produced, which identifies
   areas of high erosion potential. Field work was conducted to assess the
   method. Results indicate that the applied methodology reliably predicted
   the extent of very severe fire and, further, was generally useful for
   identifying sites of significant erosion. Additional work is required to

Abstract = {{Many physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological soil properties
   can be affected by wildfires. The effects are chiefly a result of fire
   severity and environmental factors; therefore, the consequences are
   diverse. Severe fires generally have several negative effects on soils,
   including significant removal of organic matter, deterioration of both
   structure and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients, and increased
   runoff and erosion. The effects of fire on most soil processes have been
   clearly demonstrated at the plot scale, yet it has been difficult to
   quantify their importance on larger scales. Considering fire severity
   and the threshold temperature at which the different soil properties
   change, wildfires may affect chemical characteristics and reactions
   within the soil. The rate of recovery may last a couple of decades,
   during which time many nutrients are mineralized and exposed to
   increased erosion. Nutrients from the ash enhance microbial growth and
   boost fungal activity, affecting other soil physical properties. In
   summary, the magnitude, rate, and type of most fire-affected processes
   are determined by the complex interactions between the physical,
   chemical, and biological properties of the soil as well as the
   characteristics of the fire itself. This paper provides an integrative
   overview of fire effects on soil properties and dynamics.}},

   lower diversity and abundance of seedlings, which contrasts with the
   increase in species diversity observed in response to frequent fire in
   standing vegetation. Individual taxa that declined in the seed bank in
   response to frequent fire were all taxa for which germination is

Abstract = {{Fire is a dominant disturbance within many forested ecosystems
   worldwide. Understanding the complex feedbacks among vegetation as a
   fuel for fire, the effects of fuels on fire behavior, and the impact of
   fire behavior on future vegetation are critical for sustaining
   biodiversity, in fire-dependent forests. Nonetheless, understanding in
   fire ecology has been limited in part by the difficulties in
   establishing the connections between fire behavior and vegetation
   response. To address this issue, we present the concept of the ecology
   of fuels, which emphasizes the critical role that fuels play in
   conceptually linking feedbacks between fire and vegetation. This article
   explores the ecology of the fuels concept for longleaf pine woodlands
   and illustrates its utility by evaluating the principles of ecological
   forestry (incorporating legacies of disturbances, understanding
   intermediate stand development processes, and allowing for recovery
   periods) in this chronically disturbed ecosystem. We review the research
   behind our understanding of these feedbacks in longleaf pine ecosystems
   of the southeastern United States and review the applications of these
   principles through the Stoddard-Neel method of ecological forestry.
   Understanding these feedbacks is critical for integrating fire ecology

Abstract = {{Context. Wildfire is a major driver of the structure and function of
   mallee eucalypt-and spinifex-dominated landscapes. Understanding how
   fire influences the distribution of biota in these fire-prone
   environments is essential for effective ecological and
   conservation-based management.
   Aims. We aimed to (1) determine the effects of an extensive wildfire
   (118 000 ha) on a small mammal community in the mallee shrublands of
   semiarid Australia and (2) assess the hypothesis that the fire-response
   patterns of small mammals can be predicted by their life-history
   characteristics.
   Methods. Small-mammal surveys were undertaken concurrently at 26 sites:
   once before the fire and on four occasions following the fire (including
   14 sites that remained unburnt). We documented changes in small-mammal
   occurrence before and after the fire, and compared burnt and unburnt
   sites. In addition, key components of vegetation structure were assessed
   at each site.
   Key results. Wildfire had a strong influence on vegetation structure and
   on the occurrence of small mammals. The mallee ningaui, Ningaui
   yvonneae, a dasyurid marsupial, showed a marked decline in the immediate
   post-fire environment, corresponding with a reduction in hummock-grass
   cover in recently burnt vegetation. Species richness of native small
   mammals was positively associated with unburnt vegetation, although some
   species showed no clear response to wildfire.
   Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the contention that mammal
   responses to fire are associated with their known life-history traits.
   The species most strongly affected by wildfire, N. yvonneae, has the
   most specific habitat requirements and restricted life history of the
   small mammals in the study area. The only species positively associated
   with recently burnt vegetation, the introduced house mouse, Mus
   domesticus, has a flexible life history and non-specialised resource
   requirements.
   Implications. Maintaining sources for recolonisation after large-scale
   wildfires will be vital to the conservation of native small mammals in
   mallee ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionHuman-altered disturbance regimes and agricultural land uses are
   broadly associated with reduced plant species diversity in terrestrial
   ecosystems. In this study, we seek to understand how fire frequency and
   agricultural land-use history influence savanna understorey plant
   diversity through complex relationships (i.e. indirect effects) among
   multiple biophysical variables.
   LocationFort Bragg, NC, US, Savannah River Site, SC, US and Fort
   Stewart, GA, US.
   MethodsWe use structural equation modelling (SEM) to evaluate the
   relationships among six groups of predictor variables and their
   influence on local-scale species richness in pine savannas at 256 sites
   from three locations in the southeastern USA. In the model, fire
   frequency and agricultural history are hypothesized to control richness
   through a combination of direct effects, and indirect effects mediated
   by resource availability, tree abundance, understorey plant abundance
   and the O horizon (litter and duff depth).
   ResultsFrequent fires promote richness by limiting tree abundance, which
   increases understorey abundance and reduces the O horizon. Frequent
   fires also limit the O horizon independent of tree abundance. Of the
   total positive effect of fire on richness, 70\% is attributable to
   reductions in the O horizon and 30\% to reduced tree abundance.
   Agricultural history has a negative effect on richness through a
   positive correlation with tree abundance, which decreases understorey
   abundance and increases the O horizon. Agricultural history has a modest
   negative effect on richness by reducing resource availability as well as
   a strong direct negative effect (38\% of the total effect) that is
   unrelated to other modelled variables.
   ConclusionsThrough a multivariate framework and large-scale data set,
   this study unites and tests our understanding of the factors that
   control plant species diversity in a fire-dependent ecosystem. We show
   that the effects of fire frequency and agricultural history on richness
   are largely mediated through other ecosystem attributes, including
   vegetation structure (i.e. tree and understorey abundance), resource
   availability and the O horizon. Persistent, negative effects of
   agricultural history demonstrate the slow rates of savanna plant
   community recovery on post-agricultural land and highlight the
   conservation value of frequently burned savanna remnants.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{400}},
Pages = {{555-567}},

Abstract = {{Research has been undertaken on the hydrological and erosional impact of
   forest fires, but remarkably little work has been conducted on salvage
   logging operations that often follow them. We assessed the effects of
   mechanical salvage logging following wildfire on soil physical
   properties, ground cover, and runoff and erosion response on a eucalypt
   stand in Portugal. We compared two levels of mechanical disturbance,
   skid trails by a wheeled forwarder tractor ({''}skid\_low{''}) and skid
   trails by the same tractor followed by a tracked feller-buncher
   ({''}skid\_high{''}) with control conditions (no mechanical
   disturbance). Three plots (16 m(2)) by level of soil disturbance were
   installed after a moderate intensity fire and subsequent logging
   operations, and monitored during the first post-fire year. In two
   control and two skid\_low plots runoff was also measured.
   Soil bulk density was higher with increasing mechanical disturbance.
   Soil compaction reduced porosity 7-16\%, but as the control porosity was
   70\%, the reduced porosity still was 60-65\%. Soil resistance to
   penetration significantly increased for the most disturbed area, whereas
   soil shear strength was significantly reduced in the intermediate
   disturbance level. Mechanical disturbance did not induce significant
   effects on soil moisture or ground cover. Initial greater coverage by
   bare soil in the disturbed plots compared to the control was compensated
   by a more rapid vegetation recovery in those plots.
   Annual runoff amount was not higher at the skid-low than at control
   plots. Absence of runoff difference was due to high soil porosity of
   65\%, even after tractor trafficking, and a greater surface roughness on
   the skid\_low plots compared to the control. Sediment production
   increased with increasing soil disturbance. The mean sediment rate was
   1.6-3 times greater for the disturbed than the control plots. This
   increase could be explained by the higher soil compaction and reduced
   soil shear strength on the mechanically disturbed plots and initial
   differences in ground cover. Organic matter content of the eroded
   sediments was higher on the control than the disturbed plots, due to
   initial higher ash cover on the control plots.
   Overall, sediment production was significantly related to rainfall
   intensity and reduced by vegetation regrowth. Sediment rates tend to
   decrease with time since the initial fire and logging disturbance,
   highlighting the importance of a rapid implementation of erosion control
   measures. Specific management practices are needed to minimize the
   impacts of logging in burnt soils which are already subject to greater
   erosion risk and soil degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent shifts in global forest area highlight the importance of
   understanding the causes and consequences of forest change. To examine
   the influence of several potential drivers of forest cover change, we
   used supervised dassifications of historical (1938-1940) and
   contemporary (2015) aerial imagery covering a 2932-km(2) study area in
   the northern Front Range (NFR) of Colorado and we linked observed
   changes in forest cover with abiotic factors, land use, and fire
   history. Forest cover in the NFR demonstrated broadscale changes
   1938-2015 and overall cover increased 7.8\%, but there was notable
   spatial variability and many sites also experienced Forest Loss. Recent
   (1978-2015) wildfire was the largest single driver of Forest Loss, with
   fires burning 14.3\% of the total study area. Recently burned areas
   showed net losses of 36.9\% forest cover. Reasons for Forest Gain were
   more complex, with elevation, past mining density, fire history, and
   topographic heat load index being the strongest predictors of increases
   in forest cover. Historical mining activity is one of the dominant
   anthropogenic impacts in ecosystems in the NFR and it had a complex,
   non-linear relationship with 20th-century changes in forest cover.
   Subalpine stands originating after stand-replacing fires circa mid-1800s
   to early 1900s showed some of the greatest gains in forest cover,
   indicative of slow and continuous post-fire recovery through the 20th
   century. We also investigated factors such as land ownership, road
   density, forest management activities, and development intensity, which
   played detectable, but more minor roles in observed change.
   Twentieth-century changes in forest cover throughout the NFR are a
   result of ecological disturbances and anthropogenic influences operating
   at varying time-scales and overlaid upon variability in the abiotic
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire size, frequency, and severity are increasing in the Alaskan
   boreal forest in response to climate warming. One of the potential
   impacts of this changing fire regime is the alteration of successional
   trajectories, from black spruce to mixed stands dominated by aspen, a
   vegetation composition not experienced since the early Holocene. Such
   changes in vegetation composition may consequently alter the intensity
   of fires, influencing fire feedbacks to the ecosystem. Paleorecords
   document past wildfire-vegetation dynamics and as such, are imperative
   for our understanding of how these ecosystems will respond to future
   climate warming. For the first time, we have used reflectance
   measurements of macroscopic charcoal particles (>180 mu m) from an
   Alaskan lake-sediment record to estimate ancient charring temperatures
   (termed pyrolysis intensity). We demonstrate that pyrolysis intensity
   increased markedly from an interval of birch tundra 11 ky ago (mean
   1.52\% Ro; 485 degrees C), to the expansion of trees on the landscape
   similar to 10.5 ky ago, remaining high to the present (mean 3.54\%Ro;
   640 degrees C) irrespective of stand composition. Despite differing
   flammabilities and adaptations to fire, the highest pyrolysis
   intensities derive from two intervals with distinct vegetation
   compositions. 1) the expansion of mixed aspen and spruce woodland at 10
   cal. kyr BP, and 2) the establishment of black spruce, and the modern
   boreal forest at 4 cal. kyr BP. Based on our analysis, we infer that
   predicted expansion of deciduous trees into the boreal forest in the
   future could lead to high intensity, but low severity fires, potentially
   moderating future climate-fire feedbacks.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive nonnative grasses have altered the composition of seasonally
   dry shrublands and woodlands throughout the world. In many areas they
   coexist with native woody species until fire occurs, after which they
   become dominant. Yet it is not clear how long their impacts persist in
   the absence of further fire. We evaluated the long-term impacts of grass
   invasions and subsequent fire in seasonally dry submontane habitats on
   Hawai'i, USA. We recensused transects in invaded unburned woodland and
   woodland that had burned in exotic grass-fueled fires in 1970 and 1987
   and had last been censused in 1991. In the unburned woodlands, we found
   that the dominant understory grass invader, Schizachyrium condensatum,
   had declined by; similar to 40\%, while native understory species were
   abundant and largely unchanged from measurements 17 years ago. In burned
   woodland, exotic grass cover also declined, but overall values remained
   high and recruitment of native species was poor. Sites that had
   converted to exotic grassland after a 1970 fire remained dominated by
   exotic grasses with no increase in native cover despite 37 years without
   fire. Grass-dominated sites that had burned twice also showed limited
   recovery despite 20 years of fire suppression. We found limited evidence
   for ``invasional meltdown{''}: Exotic richness remained low across
   burned sites, and the dominant species in 1991, Melinis minutiflora, is
   still dominant today. Twice-burned sites are, however, being invaded by
   the nitrogen-fixing tree Morella faya, an introduced species with the
   potential to greatly alter the successional trajectory on young volcanic
   soils. In summary, despite decades of fire suppression, native species
   show little recovery in burned Hawaiian woodlands. Thus, burned sites
   appear to be beyond a threshold for ``natural recovery{''} (e.g.,
   passive restoration).}},

Abstract = {{Regenerating forests have become a common land-cover type throughout the
   Brazilian Amazon. However, the potential for these systems to accumulate
   and store C and nutrients, and the fluxes resulting from them when they
   are cut, burned, and converted back to croplands and pastures have not
   been well quantified. In this study, we quantified pre- and post-fire
   pools of biomass, C, and nutrients, as well as the emissions of those
   elements, at a series of second- and third-growth forests located in the
   states of Para and Rondonia, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) of
   second- and third-growth forests averaged 134 and 91 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation were rapid in
   these systems, but were not significantly different between second- and
   third-growth forests, ranging from 9 to 16 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Residual
   pools of biomass originating from primary forest vegetation accounted
   for large portions of TAGB in both forest types and were primarily
   responsible for TAGB differences between the two forest types. In
   second-growth forests this pool (82 Mg ha(-1)) represented 58\% of TAGB,
   and in third-growth forests (40 Mg ha(-1)) it represented 40\% of TAGB.
   Amounts of TAGB consumed by burning of second- and third-growth forests
   averaged 70 and 53 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Aboveground pre-fire pools
   in second- and third-growth forests averaged 67 and 45 Mg C ha(-1), 821
   and 707 kg N ha(-1), 441 and 341 kg P ha(-1), and 46 and 27 kg Ca
   ha(-1), respectively. While pre-fire pools of C, N, S and K were not
   significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, pools
   of both P and Ca were significantly higher in second-growth forests.
   This suggests that increasing land use has a negative impact on these
   elemental pools. Site losses of elements resulting from slashing and
   burning these sites were highly variable: losses of C ranged from 20 to
   47 Mg ha(-1); N losses ranged from 306 to 709 kg ha(-1); Ca losses
   ranged from 10 to 145 kg ha(-1); and P losses ranged from 2 to 20 kg
   ha(-1). Elemental losses were controlled to a large extent by the
   relative distribution of elemental mass within biomass components of
   varying susceptibilities to combustion and the temperatures of
   volatilization of each element. Due to a relatively low temperature of
   volatilization and its concentration in highly combustible biomass
   pools, site losses of N averaged 70\% of total pre-fire pools. In
   contrast, site losses of P and Ca resulting from burning were 33 and
   20\% of total pre-fire pools, respectively, as much of the mass of those
   elements was deposited on site as ash. Pre- and post-fire biomass and
   elemental pools of second- and third-growth forests, as well as the
   emissions from those systems, were intermediate between those of primary
   forests and pastures in the Brazilian Amazon. Overall, regenerating
   forests have the capacity to act as either large terrestrial sinks or
   sources of C and nutrients, depending on the course of land-use patterns
   within the Brazilian Amazon. Combining remote sensing techniques with
   field measures of aboveground C accumulation in regenerating forests and
   C fluxes from those forests when they are cut and burned, we estimate
   that during 1990-1991 roughly 104 Tg of C was accumulated by
   regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon. Further, we estimate
   that approximately 103 Tg of C was lost via the cutting and burning of
   regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon during this same
   period. Since average C accumulations (5.
   5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) in regenerating forests were 19\% of the C lost
   when such forests are cut and burned (29.3 Mg ha(-1)), our results
   suggest that when less than 19\% of the total area accounted for by
   secondary forests is cut and burned in a given year, those forests will
   be net accumulators of C during that year. Conversely, when more than
   19\% of regenerating forests are burned, those forests will be a net
   source of C to the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities have resulted in novel disturbance regimes
   which have unknown impacts on biodiversity. A notable example is the
   establishment of fire regimes in ecosystems that have not historically
   burned. These new disturbance regimes leave behind a complex spatial
   matrix with varying patterns of landscape heterogeneity. Research on
   novel disturbance regimes often ignores remnant vegetation within
   disturbed habitats, even though landscape variation in a disturbed area
   can influence population and community dynamics. Our objective was to
   understand the influence of spatial heterogeneity, characterized by
   varying levels of isolation and remnant vegetation, within a landscape
   disturbed by a novel fire regime in the Mojave Desert where wildfire was
   exceedingly rare to non-existent in this landscape prior to recent
   times. We found that community patterns of both ground-dwelling
   arthropods and small mammals varied based on the amount of remnant
   vegetation and isolation levels within burned habitats. Ground-dwelling
   arthropod abundance and richness measurements were highest in burned
   habitats that had remnant long-lived vegetation present, whereas small
   mammal abundance and richness measurements were highest in continuous
   expanses of unburned habitat. We also found that the negative impacts of
   fire on arthropods and small mammal communities in isolated, burned
   habitats were masked by the presence of long-lived perennial vegetation.
   Our study highlights the importance of incorporating habitat
   heterogeneity into future studies of novel disturbance regimes and
   provides evidence for the utility of restoration plantings in desert

   overview of anthracological results is given for 200 kiln sites with
   special regard to regional and local aspects of the anthropogenic

   vegetation and offering of wood. Qualitative and quantitative
   information is deduced on the tree species combinations of the forests
   exploited and on the natural frequency of the tree species at different
   forest sites and in different forest communities. The anthracological
   results are compared with the current site conditions and the
   present-day forest vegetation.
   All of the tree species to be expected for the natural conditions were
   found in the material analysed. The frequencies of the wood species
   exploited also reflect a natural situation: The tree species of the
   climax vegetation were mainly used and all other species were
   quantitatively unimportant. The anthracological results of the
   individual sites show many differences in the combination and frequency
   of the species as well as regular distribution patterns on a large
   scale. These patterns can be explained by natural differences in the
   site conditions in the vicinity of the sites studied.
   A pronounced dependency of the charcoal production on the local natural
   offering of wood is discernible. Indications for selection of distinct
   tree species and for forest degradation could not be found. The natural
   offering, the complete exploitation of remote forest areas and the
   restricted possibilities of wood transport were important criteria for
   fuel wood exploitation. Moreover, no indications of shortages of wood or
   of import of wood or charcoal into the investigation area could be

Abstract = {{Post-fire conditions are characterized by enhanced light and the

   response. The germination response to light and nitrate was tested for
   53 species representative of the flora of a Mediterranean recently
   burned area in Central-Eastern Spain. Differences in germination among
   species, with and without taking into account their phylogeny, were
   studied by classifying them according to their life-form (chamaephytes,
   hemicryptophytes), regeneration strategy (non-sprouters, sprouters) and
   geographical distribution range (Iberian Peninsula endemics,
   Mediterranean, widely distributed species). The overall germination mean
   was not affected by any of the two treatments. There were statistically

   Species response was related to functional groups. Light response
   (stimulation vs. non-stimulation) was associated to life-form,
   regeneration strategy and distribution range. Hemicryptophytes,
   sprouters and widely distributed species were positively affected by
   light. No evidence of such an association for nitrate was found. No
   statistically significant effects of light and nitrate on the mean
   germination of the various groups (life-form, regeneration strategy,
   distribution range) were found. Moreover, significant interactions
   emerged between light and nitrate for all three groups. In summary, the
   studied set of plants appears to be non-dependent on factors that may
   change with fire, such as increased light and soil nitrate, for
   germination. Nonetheless, some species and groups will be affected by
   such changes. That means that fire will modify the relative balance of
   germination among species and functional groups. Due to the particular
   sensitivity of Iberian Peninsula endemics to light, a factor that
   significantly changes with fire, these species may be at risk under the
   current fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{Native Americans used fire to maintain prairies in western Washington,
   but few prairies remain due to land-use conversion and forest
   encroachment. We describe the process of forest encroachment on former
   western Washington prairies. We used 1853-1871 General Land Office
   Survey data to describe the historical prairie and associated timbered
   area conditions at six Joint Base Lewis-McChord sites (JBLM). We
   described modern stands growing in these same areas with stem density,
   Reineke stand density index (Reineke 1933), and site index. After
   harvesting selected trees we measured decadal tree-ring increments and
   analyzed trauma rings on 242 Douglas-fir stumps to reconstruct stand
   development. We plotted individual tree stem diameter growth curves to
   illustrate patterns of establishment. Douglas-fir density increased in
   waves from 1878-1938 associated with low-intensity fires with fire
   return intervals of 10 to 91 years. Historical tree density, which
   ranged from < 1 to 49 trees ha(-1) has increased to 122 to 207 trees
   ha(-1). Stand development was driven by fires, patterns of
   establishment, and site potential. Longer fire-free intervals resulted
   in few larger establishment waves while frequent shorter intervals
   resulted in multiple smaller cohorts. Woodlands, not prairies, resulted
   from ten or more year fire frequencies; however, mature forests grew in
   < 50 years suggesting fire frequencies appropriate for restoration of
   prairies and woodlands. Modern productive sites produced larger trees
   that experienced inter-tree competition, suggesting faster forest
   succession occurred on those sites. Light to moderately thinned
   Douglas-fir reproduced poorly on our sites. Higher intensity thinning or
   gap creation may be required for successful regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is an important driver of plant community structure in many
   grasslands and woodlands, and alteration of disturbance regimes can have
   large consequences for species richness and composition. However, the
   response of vegetation to disturbance may change with environmental
   context. We resampled a unique, nested permanent vegetation plot data
   set in the longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern USA after 20years
   to determine how environmental context and fire frequency jointly
   influence vegetation change across multiple spatial scales
   (0.01-1000m(2)). The magnitude of vegetation change was quantified using
   two different, yet complementary metrics of beta-diversity (beta
   turnover measured as the proportion of species turning over and
   Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) and by documenting changes in species
   richness. We used null model analysis to explore whether communities
   were more dynamic over time at small spatial scales relative to larger
   scales. Changes in species richness, beta turnover and Bray-Curtis
   dissimilarity were greatest on silty, frequently burned sites, whereas
   sandy, less frequently burned sites remained relatively stable. The
   amount of change detected was scale dependent: species richness
   increased at larger spatial scales over time, but decreased at the two
   smallest spatial scales. Null model analysis revealed that beta turnover
   standardized effect sizes (SES) were negative and significantly
   different from random expectation at all spatial scales except the
   smallest. Thus, the magnitude of compositional change across most scales
   was small, despite substantial changes in species richness across time.
   We attribute this initial contradiction to the turnover of infrequent,
   low-abundance species amidst a matrix of dominant grasses.Synthesis. In
   contrast to previous longleaf pine studies, we found fire frequency to
   be less important than environmental site conditions in predicting
   vegetation change. Thus, future work in this ecosystem and in other
   fire-dependent grasslands and woodlands should consider not only
   disturbance, but also environmental context. Since species richness and
   beta-diversity patterns were scale dependent, we recommend sampling
   vegetation across multiple spatial scales in order to comprehensively
   quantify changes in community structure over time. We believe this study
   lays the groundwork for understanding how fire and environmental
   filtering jointly influence vegetation dynamics across space and time in
   fire-dependent grasslands and woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Helimulching is commonly applied after high-severity wildfires in North
   America because of its effectiveness in reducing post-fire runoff and
   erosion. However, its use in other parts of the world is still very
   limited and information about its effects in different environments is
   scarce. In this study, the effects of helimulching on vegetation
   recovery and species composition were assessed in 70 experimental plots
   (80 m(2) each) established in five shrubland areas in Northwest Spain
   affected by wildfire in summer 2013. The effects on shrub, forb, fern
   and grass cover, and on total vegetation cover, as well as on species
   richness, Shannon diversity index and heterogeneity were studied over
   the 2 years following the fire. The impacts of soil burn severity and
   mulch depth on these variables were also considered. Overall, the
   mulching treatment had little effect on the cover variables. Although it
   had a positive effect on forb cover, these species represented only a
   small portion of the total vegetation cover. Soil burn severity was not
   a significant factor in explaining the variation in the variables under
   study. The treatment had a low impact on species composition. In the
   mulched plots only three non-native species were recorded and these
   displayed a limited capacity to act as invasive species as they were
   absent at the end of the period of study. The results indicate that
   helimulching is a feasible soil stabilization treatment with neutral
   effects on vegetation cover and the composition of shrubland in coastal

Abstract = {{Terrestrial ecosystems of the Atlantic coastal plain have experienced
   considerable change over the past two centuries, largely due to
   agricultural activities and fire suppression and exclusion. Many areas
   that were once dominated by open longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
   woodlands now support closed canopy stands of loblolly pine (Pinus
   taeda) with a dense midstory of broadleaved shrubs and trees. In recent
   years, efforts to restore the herbaceous plant communities typically
   found in fire-maintained longleaf pine woodlands have focused on the use
   of midstory thinning to produce savanna-like conditions and to
   facilitate the restoration of historical fire regimes through prescribed
   burning. Previous efforts to restore longleaf pine stands have focused
   on the potential of fire-suppressed longleaf pine woodlands, which have
   been met with some success. However, it is unclear what the potential is
   for loblolly pine stands to act as a `surrogate' environment for the
   restoration of the often species-rich herbaceous layer of longleaf pine
   woodlands. To assess the effectiveness of longleaf pine restoration
   treatments in existing loblolly pine stands, we analyzed the drivers of
   plant community composition in loblolly pine stands with mechanical
   midstory removal treatments, untreated loblolly pine stands, longleaf
   pine stands, and pond pine dominated high-pocosin systems. We sampled 75
   plots, from which more than 200 individual plant taxa were identified,
   with species richness (number of species per 0.1 ha) ranging from 9 in
   pond pine pocosins to 118 in longleaf pine woodlands. Plant species
   richness and composition varied in response to soil properties, with the
   first NMS ordination axis correlated with soil properties related to
   soil moisture and organic matter content (SUM), and the second NMS
   ordination axis correlated to the concentration of certain soil
   nutrients (P. Ca), the variability of which may be due, in part, to
   historic fertilizer applications. While stand types were largely
   distinct from each other in their vegetation composition, there was
   nevertheless some compositional overlap among some longleaf and loblolly
   pine stands. Areas of compositional overlap appear to have somewhat
   similar soil properties, whereby the soils found in overlapping loblolly
   pine stands were closer to those found in longleaf pine stands (i.e. low
   SUM content). Thus, an assessment of the soil properties of loblolly
   pine stands may allow for an identification of candidate sites for which
   longleaf pine restoration treatments may be most effective. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Fire exclusion has dramatically altered historically fire adapted
   forests across western North America. In response, forest managers
   reduce forest fuels with mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning
   to alter fire behavior, with additional objectives of restoring forest
   composition, structure, and ecosystem processes. There has been
   extensive research on the effects of fuel reduction and restoration
   treatments on trees, fuels, regeneration, and fire behavior; but less is
   known about how these treatments influence understory vegetation, which
   contains the majority of vascular plant diversity in many dry conifer
   forests. Of particular interest is how understory vegetation may respond
   to the season and interval of prescribed burning. The season and
   interval of prescribed burning is often determined by operational
   constraints rather than historical fire regimes, potentially resulting
   in fire conditions and burn intervals to which native plants are poorly
   adapted. In this study, we examined how understory vegetation has
   responded to season and interval of prescribed burning in ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon,
   USA. Using over a decade (2002-2015) of understory vegetation data
   collected in stands with different intervals (5 versus 15 year) and
   seasons (spring versus fall) of prescribed burning, we quantified how
   season and interval of prescribed burning has influenced understory
   vegetation compositional trajectories and indicator species over time.
   Season of prescribed burning resulted in different understory
   communities and distinct trajectories of understory composition over
   time, but interval of burning did not. Indicator species analysis
   suggests fall burning is facilitating early seral species, with native
   annual forbs displaying ephemeral responses to frequent burning, while
   invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) increased in abundance and
   frequency across all treatments over time. These findings indicate that
   understory vegetation in these ecosystems are sensitive to seasonality
   of burning, but the responses are subtle. Our findings suggest season
   and interval of prescribed burning used in this study do not result in
   large changes in understory vegetation community composition, a key
   consideration as land managers increase the pace and scale of prescribed
   fire in these forests.}},

Abstract = {{This work examined the effects of hill fire on the morphology and soil

   Distinct soil horizons were observed, and the thickness of the O (1.5-6
   cm) and A (4.5-21 cm) horizons decreased with successive development of
   the vegetation. Similarly, the immediate effect of fire on soil
   properties was observed, although it is difficult to discriminate
   between the effects of fire and those of vegetation. However, the effect
   on soil chemical properties seemed to dissipate with time after the fire
   and successional development. The fire effect raised pH, mineral
   nitrogen (NH4+ and NO3-), exchangeable Ca2+, and base saturation of the
   soils, but reduced soil organic matter (SOM) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen
   (TKN) and had no effect on total phosphorus, exchangeable K+, Na+, and
   Mg2+. Many of these effects disappeared 1 year after the occurrence of
   fire.
   In the absence of fire, natural succession proceeds in the sequence of

Abstract = {{Following western settlement, fire was suppressed directly and

   reintroduction of fire into sagebrush steppe systems may be desirable,

   used a generalized linear mixed modeling approach to analyze the
   response of native and invasive grass species to fire in an Artemisia
   tridentata subsp. wyomingensis (Wyoming big sagebrush) community in
   north-central Oregon, United States. This study examined responses of
   Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch
   wheatgrass), and Poa secunda (Sandberg bluegrass) along gradients of
   community type and topography through time post fire. Community types
   were identified as either A. tridentata subsp. wyomingensis dominant
   (brush plots) or Juniperus occidentalis (western juniper) dominant
   (woodland plots). Cover of B. tectorum was greatest in brush plots. B.
   tectorum cover increased significantly 5 yr post burn and stabilized. At
   5 yr, postburn cover of B. tectorum was 135\% in brush and 301\% in
   woodland plots of preburn cover. P. spicata was more abundant in
   woodland plots than in brush plots. In woodland plots, P. spicata cover
   decreased by 49\% 1 yr post burn but returned to preburn cover by 5 yr
   post burn. On northern exposures recovery of P. spicata cover occurred
   between 1 and 2 yr post burn, whereas on southern exposures recovery
   occurred between 2 and 5 yr post burn. The cover of P. secunda did not

Abstract = {{Intensive forest management leads to forest homogeneity and compromises
   biodiversity conservation for the sake of a single commodity provision:
   wood biomass. However, forest biodiversity supports multiple ecosystem
   functions, with the regulation of insect pest populations among the less
   understood. We studied how parasitoid functional diversity and
   composition were affected by forest management and the application of
   harvesting practices directed to the promotion of biodiversity through
   the emulation of natural disturbances, i.e. prescribed burning and
   retention forestry. We used a large-scale, replicated ecological
   experiment initiated in Finland in 2000, where forest structure was
   manipulated with several harvesting regimes in combination with
   prescribed fire. We sampled parasitoid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae)
   attacking herbivorous insects, and compared their functional diversity
   and trait composition between distinct habitats shaped by management and
   in association with plant functional composition. At the local scale,
   parasitoid taxonomic and functional diversity were positively related to
   plant functional diversity. Variation in parasitoid functional
   composition was linked to the different habitats created by forest
   management and was associated with plant functional composition.
   Diversity of forest management, involving prescribed fire, variable tree
   retention and the preservation of old-growth forest, increases habitat
   diversity in boreal forests. This management leads to higher forest
   heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, increasing plant structural
   diversity and cascading up to higher trophic levels, resulting in higher
   parasitoid functional diversity. This result gives further support for
   the importance of preserving natural early successional and old-growth
   boreal forests, with potential benefits of improved natural biological

Abstract = {{Positive feedbacks between wildfire emissions and climate are expected
   to increase in strength in the future; however, fires not only release
   carbon (C) from terrestrial to atmospheric pools, they also produce
   pyrogenic C (PyC) which contributes to longer-term C stability. Our
   objective was to quantify wildfire impacts on total C and PyC stocks in
   California mixed-conifer forest, and to investigate patterns in C and
   PyC stocks and changes across gradients of fire severity, using metrics
   derived from remote sensing and field observations. Our unique study
   accessed active wildfires to establish and measure plots within days
   before and after fire, prior to substantial erosion. We measured pre-
   and post-fire aboveground forest structure and woody fuels to calculate
   aboveground biomass, C and PyC, and collected forest floor and 0-5 cm
   mineral soil samples. Immediate tree mortality increased with severity,
   but overstory C loss was minimal and limited primarily to foliage. Fire
   released 85\% of understory and herbaceous C (comprising <1.0\% of total
   ecosystem C). The greatest C losses occurred from downed wood and forest
   floor pools (19.3 +/- 5.1 Mg ha(-1) and 25.9 +/- 3.2 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively). Tree bark and downed wood contributed the greatest PyC
   gains (1.5 +/- 0.3 Mg ha(-1) and 1.9 +/- 0.8 Mg ha(-1) , respectively),
   and PyC in tree bark showed non-significant positive trends with
   increasing severity. Overall PyC losses of 1.9 +/- 0.3 Mg ha(-1) and 0.5
   +/- 0.1 Mg ha(-1) occurred from forest floor and 0-5 cm mineral soil,
   with no clear patterns across severity. Fire resulted in a net ecosystem
   PyC gain (1.0 +/- 1.0 Mg ha(-1)) across aboveground and belowground
   components of these forests, and there were no differences among
   severity levels. Carbon emissions represented only 21.6\% of total
   forest C; however, extensive conversion of C from live to dead pools
   will contribute to large downed wood C pools susceptible to release in a
   subsequent fire, indicating that there may be a delayed relationship
   between fire severity and C emissions. This research advances
   understanding of forest C loss and stabilization as PyC in wildfires;
   however, poor relationships between C and PyC gains or losses and fire
   severity highlight the complexity of fire impacts on forest C.}},

   Common human activities including livestock grazing, fuelwood extraction
   and burning have the potential to impact forest ecosystem structure and

   soil properties were investigated in Bandipur National Park (BNP) in
   southern India. Data were collected from 200 sites in four watersheds
   within the park. Sample sites spanned a degradation gradient measured by
   a field disturbance index (FDI). This paper focusses on the impacts on
   vegetation structure, diversity and composition, and integrates impacts
   on soil. Shrub and tree species were inventoried and evaluated in plots
   10-m in diameter. The tree layer was dominated by
   Anogeissus-Emblica-Tectona species. The understory was dominated by
   invasives Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara, and native gymnosporia
   emarginata. Vegetation plot heights, canopy cover and tree diameters
   were negatively correlated with field disturbance resulting in stunted
   forest stature in degraded sites. Vegetation composition in degraded
   watersheds was dominated by small woody tree species and a greater
   diversity of shrub species. Ordination analysis was used to integrate
   soil data with vegetation and disturbance, revealing that deciduous

   exotic annuals. Multiple successional pathways following fire have been
   observed in these vegetation types. Following the 1996 wildfires in
   west-central Utah, burned and unburned vegetation were compared at four
   sites. Measures of frequency, cover, and density of vascular plant
   species were used to show fire effects and to follow population dynamics
   over a period of 3 years. Woody species characteristic of the unburned
   areas were generally absent from the burned areas. Native herbaceous
   species, particularly annual forbs, were abundant in the burned areas 1
   year after the fires, but many of these declined by the second and third
   year, as exotic species, particularly cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum),
   increased. Cheatgrass became dominant in the interspaces among burned
   trees by the second year following the fires, a period of high
   precipitation. In the subcanopy zones of burned trees, cheatgrass did
   not become dominant until the third year following the fire, and was
   preceded by exotic annual forbs. Community composition and structure
   differed by site as well as by fire history. Cheatgrass cover was lowest
   at a site where perennial grasses and forbs had become established
   through aerial broadcast seeding.}},

Abstract = {{Information on fire probability is of vital importance to environmental
   and ecological studies as well as to fire management. This study aimed
   at comparing two forest fire probability mapping techniques, one based
   primarily on freely distributed EO (Earth observation) data from Landsat
   imagery, and another one based purely on GIS modeling. The Normalized
   Burn Ratio (NBR) computed from Landsat data was used to detect the high
   fire severity and probability area based on the NBR difference between
   pre- and post-fire conditions. The GIS-based modeling was based on a
   multi criterion evaluation technique, into which other attributes like
   anthropogenic and natural sources were also incorporated. The ability of
   both techniques to map forest fire probability was evaluated for a
   region in India, for which suitable ancillary data had been previously
   acquired to support a rigorous validation. Subsequently, a conceptual
   framework for the prediction of high fire probability zones in an area
   based on a newly introduced herein data fusion technique was
   constructed. Overall, the EO-based technique was found to be the most
   suitable option, since it required less computational time and resources
   in comparison to the GIS-based modeling approach. Furthermore, the
   fusion approach offered an appropriate path for developing a forest fire
   probability identification model for long-term pragmatic conservation of
   forests. The potential fusion of these two modeling approaches may
   provide information that can be useful to forest fire mitigation policy
   makers, and assist at conservation and resilience practices.}},

Abstract = {{Predation and fire shape the structure and function of ecosystems
   globally. However, studies exploring interactions between these two
   processes are rare, especially at large spatial scales. This knowledge
   gap is significant not only for ecological theory, but also in an
   applied context, because it limits the ability of landscape managers to
   predict the outcomes of manipulating fire and predators. We examined the
   influence of fire on the occurrence of an introduced and widespread
   mesopredator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), in semi-arid Australia. We
   used two extensive and complimentary datasets collected at two spatial
   scales. At the landscape-scale, we surveyed red foxes using sand-plots
   within 28 study landscapes - which incorporated variation in the
   diversity and proportional extent of fire-age classes - located across a
   104 000 km(2) study area. At the site-scale, we surveyed red foxes using
   camera traps at 108 sites stratified along a century-long post-fire
   chronosequence (0-105 years) within a 6630 km(2) study area. Red foxes
   were widespread both at the landscape and site-scale. Fire did not
   influence fox distribution at either spatial scale, nor did other
   environmental variables that we measured. Our results show that red
   foxes exploit a broad range of environmental conditions within semi-arid
   Australia. The presence of red foxes throughout much of the landscape is
   likely to have significant implications for native fauna, particularly
   in recently burnt habitats where reduced cover may increase prey
   species' predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Five vascular plant surveys have been made between 1873 and 1999 on
   Penikese, one of the Elizabeth Islands (Massachusetts). The five surveys
   have noted a total of 326 species, the most recent survey, 218 species.
   Almost half of the species noted are alien on all five survey lists.
   Four rare (state-listed) native species were found in 1998-1999. The
   most significant change in the island's vegetation over 125 years is the
   great increase in woody vines and shrubs following cessation of the
   farming that stripped the island of its presettlement forest. Fifteen
   woody species, some of them recent introductions, are thought to be
   increasing. Two of the island's ponds-Tubs and South-are brackish,
   supratidal pools without vascular plants. Four ponds-North, Leper, Tern,
   and Typha-are fresh, shallow, and usually dry up annually, at which time
   their bottoms support a dense, diverse flora. Salt marsh species and
   numbers are fewer than formerly. There is evidence that the island as
   plant habitat is drier than in the past, perhaps as a result of the
   increase in woody vegetation. For instance, ferns, once common on
   Penikese, are now almost wholly absent. Certain species common on nearby
   islands are missing; for instance, no blueberries or other ericads are
   found on Penikese. In the absence of further disturbance, it is possible
   that Penikese will again become forested with red cedar (Juniperus
   virginiana) as a presettlement account of 1602 describes it, but
   island-wide burns are suggested for destroying invasive woody plants and
   encouraging native grasses. Such burns might also restore former
   tern-nesting sites to usefulness.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of boreal coniferous forests is used in Northern Europe to
   increase the natural variability of forest structure and to add coarse
   woody debris for red-listed dead-wood dependent species, mainly insects
   and fungi. In four protection areas of eastern Finland, we evaluated how
   three commonly used restoration methods (felling with chainsaw, storm
   simulation, and felling with burning) with two felling levels (20\% and
   40\% of initial living stand volume) affect the vegetation dynamics. The
   aim was to assess whether the type and intensity of restoration lead to
   different stages in the plant succession which would reflect the
   effectiveness of the restoration methods in terms of simulating natural
   disturbances. The restoration treatments were conducted in 2006 on 43
   experimental stands and 15 were set as controls. Understory vegetation
   cover was surveyed from 372 permanent 1 m(2) plots in 2005, 2007 and
   2011. The data were analyzed with mixed effect models and multivariate
   methods. Burning most efficiently initiated natural vegetation
   succession. Despite the initial decline of nearly all plant functional
   types, pioneering species such as Betula spp. and Populus tremula,
   forbs, graminoids and pioneer mosses regenerated quickly and exceeded
   their pre-disturbance covers in 2011. Dwarf shrubs Vaccinium myrtillus,
   V. vitis-idaea and Calluna vulgaris recovered nearly to their initial
   levels, whereas Empetrum nigrum, forest mosses and lichens did not show
   any recovery in five years. Storm simulation increased species richness
   on the stand scale and promoted the regeneration of Pinus sylvestris in
   soil exposed by tree uprooting. Tree felling slightly decreased the
   cover of lichens on the lower felling level treatment. We generated a
   species response table illustrating the responses of dominant species to
   restoration methods in the course of the seven-year study. We conclude
   that the dominant restoration method, tree felling, could increasingly
   be replaced by burning and storm simulation which have faster and
   greater positive impacts on the forest ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Biogeochemical cycling in the boreal forest landscape is driven by
   physical, chemical and biological properties that are regulated by
   permafrost and the fire disturbance regime. We measured stream
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and nitrate (NO3-) in
   watersheds underlain by 3\% permafrost, 18\% permafrost, and 53\%
   permafrost during two storm events in July and September 1999. In the
   intermediate permafrost watershed, we examined the effect of the
   FROSTFIRE prescribed burn that took place in July 1999. The storm
   hydrograph for the September event was separated into old and new water
   components using a two-end member mixing model. Post-fire observations
   for storm events in July and September 1999 show positive relationships
   between DOC and discharge for all basins. The increase in DOC during
   storms was greatest in HIP, moderate in the burn, and smallest in LoP.
   The NO3- response was variable across all basins. There was a negative
   relationship between NO3- and discharge in LoP and a positive
   relationship in HiP. Our results show that DOC and NO3- concentrations
   are influenced by permafrost. Nitrate and DOC increased in Hip despite a
   larger contribution of ``new{''} water (precipitation low in NO3- and
   DOG) to the stormflow peak. Nitrate was leached in the active layer of
   HiP, but diluted by rain water or NO3- depleted soil water in LoP. In
   the burn basin, the immediate fire effect is shown by a non-linear
   response of NO3- to increased flow in the post-fire rain event in Jury.
   This hyteresis indicates that nitrate from burned soils in the
   contributing area for stormflow may have reached the stream. The
   long-term effect of the prescribed fire will be driven by changes in the
   active layer depth due to removal of the insulative moss layer on the
   forest floor. Future stormflow analyses will include isotope tracers to
   identify sources of carbon and nitrogen to stream chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{The early post-fire development of mycobiota following a crown fire in
   mountain pine plantations and a surface fire in Scots pine plantations,
   and in the corresponding unburnt stands in the coastal sand dunes of the
   Curonian Spit in western Lithuania was investigated. Species numbers in
   unburnt Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris stands showed annual
   fluctuation, but in the burnt sites, the numbers of fungi increased
   yearly, especially in the crown fire plots. Both burnt stand types-P.
   mugo and P. sylvestris-showed strongly significant (two-way ANOSIM; R =
   1, p < 0.05) differences in species composition; the differences between
   unburnt sites were clearly expressed but less significant (R = 0.86, p <
   0.05). Fungal species composition of burnt P. mugo and P. sylvestris
   sites was qualitatively different from that of corresponding unburnt
   sites (two-way ANOSIM; R a parts per thousand yen 0.75, p < 0.05). The
   chronosequence of mycobiota in surface fire burns was less clearly
   defined than in crown fire sites, reflecting the greater patchiness of
   impacts of the surface fire. Although both fire types were detrimental
   or at least damaging to all functional groups of fungi (saprobic on soil
   and forest litter, wood-inhabiting, biotrophic, and mycorrhizal and
   lichenized fungi), their recovery and appearance (fructification)
   patterns varied between the groups and among the burn types. The end of
   the early post-fire fungal succession (cessation of sporocarp production
   of pyrophilous fungi) was recorded 3 years after the fire for both crown
   and surface fire types, which is earlier than reported by other authors.
   Rare or threatened fungal species that are dependent on fire regime were
   not recorded during the study.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi are essential components of all ecosystems in roles including
   symbiotic partners, decomposers and nutrient cyclers and as a source of
   food for vertebrates and invertebrates. Fire changes the environment in
   which fungi live by affecting soil structure, nutrient availability,
   organic and inorganic substrates and other biotic components with which
   fungi interact, particularly mycophagous animals. We review the
   literature on fire and fungi in Australia, collating studies that
   include sites with different time since fire or different fire regimes.
   The studies used a variety of methods for survey and identification of
   fungi and focussed on different groups of fungi, with an emphasis on
   fruit-bodies of epigeal macrofungi and a lack of studies on microfungi
   in soil or plant tissues. There was a lack of replication of fire
   treatment effects in some studies. Nevertheless, most studies reported
   some consequence of fire on the fungal community. Studies on fire and
   fungi were concentrated in eucalypt forest in south-west and
   south-eastern Australia, and were lacking for ecosystems such as
   grasslands and tropical savannahs. The effects of fire on fungi are
   highly variable and depend on factors such as soil and vegetation type
   and variation in fire intensity and history, including the length of
   time between fires. There is a post-fire flush of fruit-bodies of
   pyrophilous macrofungi, but there are also fungi that prefer long
   unburnt vegetation. The few studies that tested the effect of fire
   regimes in relation to the intervals between burns did not yield
   consistent results. The functional roles of fungi in ecosystems and the
   interactions of fire with these functions are explained and discussed.
   Responses of fungi to fire are reviewed for each fungal trophic group,
   and also in relation to interactions between fungi and vertebrates and
   invertebrates. Recommendations are made to include monitoring of fungi
   in large-scale fire management research programs and to integrate the
   use of morphological and molecular methods of identification.
   Preliminary results suggest that fire mosaics promote heterogeneity in
   the fungal community. Management of substrates could assist in
   preserving fungal diversity in the absence of specific information on
   fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Postfire regeneration problems compromise the maintenance of

   outbreaks followed by fire may be responsible for this shift. Leaving
   behind unfavourable seedbeds for the germination of black spruce (Picea
   mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) seeds, low-severity fires may also be involved
   in this transformation. The severity of recent fires and their impact on
   black spruce regeneration were evaluated using 13 stands burned in
   spring or summer within the closed-crown forest in Quebec during the
   last 20 years. Two ecological indicators were used to characterize fire
   severity: thickness of residual organic material and recovery of plant
   species. Regardless of the season, the ground of all burned stands was
   covered with a thick layer of residual organic matter. Blackened organic
   matter and ericaceous vegetation, indicating the passage of a
   low-severity fire, were widespread in all sites whereas acrocarpous
   mosses and bare mineral soil, indicating the passage of a severe fire,
   were uncommon. The preponderance of the thick layer of residual organic
   material blackened at the surface can explain the failure of
   regeneration in most studied sites. Low-severity fires are thus among
   factors probably involved in the expansion of lichen woodlands within
   the closed-crown forest.}},

Abstract = {{1. A fire history (1980 to the present) developed for Kakadu National
   Park, derived mostly from manual interpretation of LANDSAT MultiSpectral
   Scanner (MSS) imagery, was used as the temporal basis for undertaking
   rapid assessment of the effects of fire regimes on floristically diverse
   vegetation containing many regionally endemic species, occupying
   sandstone formations of the Arnhem Plateau, monsoonal northern
   Australia.
   2. Three broad vegetation types were identified through TWINSPAN
   classification of floristic composition at 108 sample plots:
   Allosyncarpia-dominated closed forest; open forest/woodland savanna with
   an annual grass understorey; and open shrubby heath interspersed with
   perennial hummock grasses. All sampled vegetation occurred on freely
   draining, oligotrophic substrates derived from sandstone parent
   materials; grazing and browsing of sampled vegetation were not
   significant factors.
   3. The three fire frequency parameters derived from the assembled fire
   history ('years unburnt', `fire frequency', `shortest interfire
   interval') were autocorrelated. Correlative analyses between vegetation
   structure and soil nutrient variables, and `years unburnt', demonstrated
   generally increasing shrub densities, fuel loads and soil fertilities
   with increasing time since last burnt. Identified limitations in
   assembled data included: substantial between-plot structural variation
   for respective vegetation types, reflecting diverse ecological and fire
   histories of individual plots; and inability to describe accurately the
   important fire regime variable `fire intensity' from the imagery used.
   4. Assessment of the reproductive maturity of obligate seeder shrub
   species indicated that, whereas vegetation at some sites could tolerate
   burning after 3-year intervals without loss of floristic diversity, many
   species required fire-free intervals of more than 5 years, particularly
   those occupying harsher, rocky sites. In contrast, fine grass and litter
   fuels were sufficient to support intense fires in all representative
   situations under late dry season climatic conditions within 1-3 years of
   having been burnt previously.
   5. Published fire history data for the period 1980-94 show that 40\% of
   vegetation occupying sandstone-derived landforms in Kakadu National Park
   have been burnt at frequencies of at least 1 in 3 years; such fire
   frequencies evidently cannot be sustained without substantial loss of
   obligate seeder species, comprising 54\% of the sampled shrubby heath
   flora. The data support other observations concerning the catastrophic
   impact of contemporary lire regimes on fire-sensitive vegetation types
   in other sandstone regions of northern and north-western Australia.
   6. Based on these insights, an established programme for strategic fire
   management of the Arnhem Plateau is outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Burn severity is an important parameter in post-fire management. It
   incorporates both the direct fire impact (vegetation depletion) and
   ecosystem responses (vegetation regeneration). From a remote sensing
   perspective, burn severity is traditionally estimated using Landsat's
   differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR). In this case study of the
   large 2007 Peloponnese (Greece) wildfires, Landsat dNBR estimates
   correlated reasonably well with Geo composite burn index (GeoCBI) field
   data of severity (R-2=0.56). The usage of Landsat imagery is, however,
   restricted by cloud cover and image-to-image normalization constraints.
   Therefore a multi-temporal burn severity approach based on coarse
   spatial, high temporal resolution moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery is presented in this study. The
   multi-temporal dNBR (dNBR(MT)) is defined as the 1-year integrated
   difference between burned pixels and their unique control pixels. These
   control pixels were selected based on time series similarity and spatial
   context and reflect how burned pixels would have behaved in the case no
   fire had occurred. Linear regression between downsampled Landsat dNBR
   and dNBR(MT) estimates resulted in a moderate-high coefficient of
   determination R-2=0.54. dNBR(MT) estimates are indicative for the change
   in vegetation productivity due to the fire. This change is considerably
   higher for forests than for more sparsely vegetated areas like shrub
   lands. Although Landsat dNBR is superior for spatial detail,
   MODIS-derived dNBR(MT) estimates present a valuable alternative for burn
   severity mapping at continental to global scale without image
   availability constraints. This is beneficial to compare trends in burn
   severity across regions and time. Moreover, thanks to MODIS's repeated
   temporal sampling, the dNBR(MT) accounts for both first- and

Abstract = {{Intensively managed pine forests in the southeastern U.S. now cover
   approximately 15.8 million ha. Forest managers are increasingly expected
   to consider biodiversity in land management decisions. Habitat
   management, particularly dormant-season prescribed fire with or without
   prior herbicide application may provide an opportunity for achieving
   sustainability goals relative to biodiversity in intensively managed
   pine stands. Therefore, we investigated vegetation structure, coverage,
   and diversity responses to combinations of prescribed fire and herbicide
   (imazapyr) treatments within mid-rotation, thinned, intensively managed
   pine stands within a managed forest matrix in east-central Mississippi,
   USA during 1999-2008. We used a randomized complete block design of 6
   mid-rotation, thinned pine stands (blocks) each with 4 treatments
   {[}control, burn only (dormant-season 3 year fire return interval),
   herbicide only (Arsenal AC (R) at 12 oz./acre), burn + herbicide)
   assigned to 10-ha experimental units. We measured vegetation structure
   (understory, midstory, and overstory components) and understory plant
   coverage using standard techniques from one year pre-treatment (1999;
   our baseline) through 9 years post-treatment (2008). To evaluate
   treatment effects, we used repeated measures mixed models analysis of
   covariance with baseline data as our covariate. We detected 338 plant
   species including 140 forbs, 5 ferns, 35 grasses, 11 herbaceous vines,
   21 legumes, 26 sedges and rushes, 9 semi-woody vines, 76 woody plants,
   and 15 woody vine species. Treatment effects included concomitant
   reductions in upper level visual obstruction (m), increased herbaceous
   understory coverage, and hardwood midstory competition reduction.
   Herbicide was more effective at reducing hardwood midstory basal area,
   but repeated disturbances by prescribed fire maintained favorable
   vegetation structure conditions and improved understory plant species
   diversity throughout the latter years of study. Overstory pine basal
   area demonstrated positive responses to treatments. Prescribed fire and
   herbicide, within thinned, intensively managed pine stands at levels
   investigated here, appears to promote a stand structure consisting of a
   pine overstory and a diverse understory, reflective of historic
   conditions in the southeastern U.S. Implementation of these treatments
   can help forest managers achieve sustainable forestry goals in
   intensively managed pine stands of the southeastern U.S. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{(Post-fire flowering and fruiting in Vellozia sincorana, a caulescent

   \& Ayensu, an endemic of campos rupestres, is an endangered species
   collected by local people to start cooking fires due to the flammability
   of its resinous stems. A massive flowering of V. sincorana following a
   wildfire in October 1999 raised some questions: Does fire affect
   flowering and fruiting of V sincorana? Is the height of individuals
   correlated with flowering and fruit production? A wildfire event on 8
   November 2008 provided an opportunity to explore these questions. Two
   populations of V sincorana in two campos rupestres sites (12 degrees
   31'S - 41 degrees 29W; 12 degrees 36'S - 41 degrees 28'W) on ridgetops
   in the Chapada Diamantina National Park (Brazil) were monitored, one
   burned in the November 2008 fire and the other unburned since the 1999
   fire. In both sites, 25 individuals were randomly labeled and monitored.
   Nine plant samplings were conducted between 2008 and 2010, during which
   the number of flowers and fruits were tallied and the heights measured.
   Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and linear regression were used
   to evaluate the relationship between the height of individuals and
   phenology. Flowering and fruiting occurred only in the recently burnt
   population, about 40 days after the fire, in 24 of the 25 individuals
   monitored (96\%). The quantity of flower and/or fruit was positively and
   significantly correlated with plant height. The abundant flowering after
   fire suggests that fire triggers this phenological phase. Estimates of
   age of the taller individuals and the periods of flowering can be used
   to estimate fire frequency in the V sincorana population sites, which
   contributes to the knowledge of fire ecology and is useful for
   conservation biology and fire management of campos rupestres.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Maps of the number, size, and species of trees in forests across the
   western United States are desirable for many applications such as
   estimating terrestrial carbon resources, predicting tree mortality
   following wildfires, and for forest inventory. However, detailed mapping
   of trees for large areas is not feasible with current technologies, but
   statistical methods for matching the forest plot data with biophysical
   characteristics of the landscape offer a practical means to populate
   landscapes with a limited set of forest plot inventory data. We used a
   modified random forests approach with Landscape Fire and Resource
   Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) vegetation and biophysical
   predictors to impute plot data collected by the US Forest Service's
   Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) to the landscape at 30-m grid
   resolution. This method imputes the plot with the best statistical
   match, according to a ``forest{''} of decision trees, to each pixel of
   gridded landscape data. In this work, we used the LANDFIRE data set for
   gridded input because it is publicly available, offers seamless coverage
   of variables needed for fire models, and is consistent with other data
   sets, including burn probabilities and flame length probabilities
   generated for the continental United States. The main output of this
   project is a map of imputed plot identifiers at 30 x 30 m spatial
   resolution for the western United States that can be linked to the FIA
   databases to produce tree-level maps or to map other plot attributes. In
   addition, we used the imputed inventory data to generate maps of forest
   cover, forest height, and vegetation group at 30 x 30 m resolution for
   all forested pixels in the western United States, as a means of
   assessing the accuracy of our methodology. The results showed good
   correspondence between the target LANDFIRE data and the imputed plot
   data, with an overall within-class agreement of 79\% for forest cover,
   96\% for forest height, and 92\% for vegetation group.}},

   density averaged more than 20 times the historical tree density, and
   basal area was 4 to 6 times higher in contemporary forests than in

   trees to emulate the forest density, tree composition, and spatial
   distribution in 1870, followed by prescribed burning. Following
   restoration treatment, tree density was significantly reduced but
   remained 6 times higher than historical forests. Basal area in restored
   forests was still 2.5 times greater than reconstructed basal area
   values. Ponderosa pine dominance changed little from pretreatment data

Abstract = {{Shifts in moss communities may affect the resilience of boreal
   ecosystems to a changing climate because of the role of moss species in
   regulating soil climate and biogeochemical cycling. Here, we use
   long-term data analysis and literature synthesis to examine the role of
   moss in ecosystem succession, productivity, and decomposition. In
   Alaskan forests, moss abundance showed a unimodal distribution with time
   since fire, peaking 30-70 years post-fire. We found no evidence of
   mosses compensating for low vascular productivity in low-fertility sites
   at large scales, although a trade-off between moss and vascular
   productivity was evident in intermediate-productivity sites. Mosses
   contributed 48\% and 20\% of wetland and upland productivity,
   respectively, but produced tissue that decomposed more slowly than both
   nonwoody and woody vascular tissues. Increasing fire frequency in Alaska
   is likely to favor feather moss proliferation and decrease Sphagnum
   abundance, which will reduce soil moisture retention and decrease peat
   accumulation, likely leading to deeper burning during wildfire and
   accelerated permafrost thaw. The roles of moss traits in regulating key
   aspects of boreal performance (ecosystem N supply, C sequestration,
   permafrost stability, and fire severity) represent critical areas for
   understanding the resilience of Alaska's boreal forest region under

   sites are compositionally distinct from post-fire and mature natural

   natural stands. Communities developing on FFMM are more similar to
   post-fire successional communities than those on PMM, with high species
   richness and diversity on FFMM comparable with post-fire stands. Cover

Abstract = {{Forest and fire management planning activities are carried out mostly
   independently of each other. This paper discusses research aiming at the
   development of methods and tools that can be used for enhanced
   integration of forest and fire management planning activities.
   Specifically, fire damage models were developed for Eucalyptus globulus
   Labill stands in Portugal. Models are based on easily measurable forest
   characteristics so that forest managers may predict post-fire mortality
   based on forest structure. For this purpose, biometric data and
   fire-damage descriptors from 2005/2006 National Forest Inventory plots
   and other sample plots within 2006, 2007 and 2008 fire areas were used.
   A three-step modelling strategy based on logistic regression methods was
   used. In the first step, a model was developed to predict whether
   mortality occurs after a wildfire in a eucalypt stand. In the second
   step the degree of damage caused by wildfires in stands where mortality
   occurs is quantified (i.e. percentage of mortality). In the third step
   this mortality is distributed among trees. Data from over 85 plots and
   1648 trees were used for modeling purposes. The damage models show that
   relative damage increases with stand basal area. Tree level mortality
   models indicate that trees with high diameters, in dominant positions
   and located in regular stands are less prone to die when a wildfire
   occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Podocarpus drouynianus is unusual in the Podocarpaceae and conifers in
   general in being a strongly resprouting species which thrives in a
   fire-prone environment. The species is a dioecious, multi-stemmed shrub
   endemic to the eucalypt forests of the south-west of Western Australia.
   Stems are killed by fire but it is able to regenerate its foliage from a
   lignotuber. The total bud bank seems to be released by burning and death
   of the shoots, while pruning without fire releases only a proportion of
   available buds. Growth rate of resprouts is initially rapid, with stems
   reaching 25\% of their mature length in the first year after fire.
   However, growth of juvenile plants is very slow. Fire promotes cone
   production on the new stems about one year after fire. The large seed is
   recalcitrant but timing of germination coincides with the wettest time
   of the year in the area where the species grows. Pyrogenic coning avoids
   loss of seed due to severe fires and is a form of mast reproduction that
   benefits this species by increasing pollen transfer and producing a mass
   seed crop to attract the primary vertebrate disperser - the emu. The
   strong resprouting ability ensures the species is resilient to frequent
   disturbance and to severe predation of the seed crop. Vertebrate
   dispersal tends to concentrate seed lots, making them vulnerable to
   predation if they are deposited in open areas. However, being dispersed
   by a large vertebrate will ensure long-distance dispersal, often to
   areas beyond that which was subject to fire. These would include
   vegetated areas, where the large seeds could lodge in safe sites and
   produce seedlings that are able to survive under the shade of
   established plants. (c) 2005 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Seed germination in many species from fire-prone ecosystems may be
   triggered by heat shock and/or temperature fluctuation, and how species
   respond to such fire-related cues is important to understand post-fire
   regeneration strategies. Thus, we tested how heat shock and daily
   temperature fluctuations affect the germination of four species from
   fire-prone ecosystems; two from the Cerrado and two from the
   Mediterranean Basin. Seeds of all four species were subjected to four
   treatments: Fire (F), temperature fluctuations (TF), fire+temperature
   fluctuations (F+TF) and control (C). After treatments, seeds were put to
   germinate for 60 days at 25 degrees C (dark). Responses differed
   according to species and native ecosystem. Germination percentage for
   the Cerrado species did not increase with any of the treatments, while
   germination of one Mediterranean species increased with all treatments
   and the other only with treatments that included fire. Although the
   Cerrado species did not respond to the treatments used in this study,
   their seeds survived the exposure to heat shock, which suggests they
   possess tolerance to fire. Fire frequency in the Cerrado is higher than
   that in Mediterranean ecosystems, thus traits related to fire-resistance
   would be more advantageous than traits related to post-fire recruitment,
   which are widespread among Mediterranean species.}},

Abstract = {{Large amounts of logs and coarse woody debris remain in the ecosystem

   the first 10-cm soil layer. Soils were poorly developed and nutrients
   limiting for the vegetation requirements. Charred woody material still
   contained a relatively high concentration of nutrients compared to those
   reported for unburnt pine wood, and in general, this decreased with
   altitude. Partially charred wood represented a considerable pool of
   nutrients, due to both the relatively high concentrations and to the
   great amount of biomass still present after the fire. Potential
   contributions of the charred wood were particularly relevant for N and
   micronutrients Na, Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu, as wood contained 2-9 times more

Abstract = {{Forest disturbances diminish ecosystem services and boost disservices.
   Because post-disturbance management intends to recover the greatest
   possible value, selling timber often prevails over other considerations.
   Ecological research has shown diverse effects of salvage logging, yet
   such research has focused on the biophysical component of
   post-disturbance ecosystems and lacks the link with human well-being.
   Here we bridge that gap under the ecosystem services framework by
   assessing the impact of post-fire management on a non-timber value. By
   employing the replacement cost method, we calculated the value of the
   post-fire natural regeneration of Holm oaks in southern Spain under
   three post-fire management options by considering the cost of planting
   instead. The value of this ecosystem service in nonintervention areas
   doubled that of salvage-logged stands due to the preference for standing
   dead trees by the main seed disperser. Still, most of the value resulted
   from the resprouting capacity of oaks. The value of this and other
   ecosystem services should be added to traditional cost/benefit analyses
   of post-disturbance management. We thus call for a more holistic
   approach to salvage logging research, one that explicitly links
   ecological processes with human well-being through ecosystem services,
   to better inform decision-makers on the outcomes of post-disturbance
   management.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Landscape complexity in the boreal forest is a function of physiographic
   complexity (spatial processes) and post-fire successional (temporal)
   processes operating across scales. In this study we examine the role of
   succession and topographic complexity in determining the landscape
   complexity of Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada. Landscape
   complexity is assessed by using multifractal analysis to quantify
   landscape patterns from Landsat TM imagery. To determine whether
   complexity changes with age, ``young{''} sites (post-fire stand ages =
   11 and 30 years) were matched with adjacent ``old{''} sites (post-fire
   stand ages >95 years). The influence of physiography on landscape
   complexity is examined by comparing sites having ``simple{''} and
   ``complex{''} physiographies (as determined by fractal surface
   analysis). The scaling properties of landscape complexity are determined
   by calculating the multifractal spectrum (D-q) for each site. Landscape
   complexity increases during early succession; multifractal profiles of
   11 year old sites are lower than those of adjacent older stands.
   However, the multifractal profiles of 30 year old and adjacent older
   stands are indistinguishable, suggesting that change in landscape
   complexity occurs within 30 years following fire. Physiographically
   ``complex{''} sites have consistently greater landscape complexity than
   adjacent ``simple{''} sites. We conclude that landscape complexity
   increases over time as succession proceeds, and in space along a
   gradient from ``simple{''} to ``complex{''} physiographies. It follows
   that landscape complexity is lowest in early-successional,
   physiographically ``simple{''} sites and highest in late-successional,
   physiographically ``complex{''} sites.}},

Abstract = {{During the past century, systematic wildfire suppression has decreased
   fire frequency and increased fire severity in the western United States
   of America. While this has resulted in large ecological changes
   aboveground such as altered tree species composition and increased
   forest density, little is known about the long-term, belowground
   implications of altered, ecologically novel, fire regimes, especially on
   soil biological processes. To better understand the long-term
   implications of ecologically novel, high-severity fire, we used a 44-yr
   high-severity fire chronosequence in the Sierra Nevada where forests
   were historically adapted to frequent, low-severity fire, but were fire
   suppressed for at least 70 yr. High-severity fire in the Sierra Nevada
   resulted in a long-term (44 +yr) decrease (>50\%, P < 0.05) in soil
   extracellular enzyme activities, basal microbial respiration (56-72\%, P
   < 0.05), and organic carbon (>50\%, P < 0.05) in the upper 5 cm compared
   to sites that had not been burned for at least 115 yr. However, nitrogen
   (N) processes were only affected in the most recent fire site (4 yr
   post-fire). Net nitrification increased by over 600\% in the most recent
   fire site (P < 0.001), but returned to similar levels as the unburned
   control in the 13-yr site. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find
   a consistent effect of plant cover type on soil biogeochemical processes
   in mid-successional (10-50 yr) forest soils. Rather, the 44-yr reduction
   in soil organic carbon (C) quantity correlated positively with dampened
   C cycling processes. Our results show the drastic and long-term
   implication of ecologically novel, high-severity fire on soil
   biogeochemistry and underscore the need for long-term fire ecological
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{As climate change proceeds, a change in the frequency and intensity of
   fire events is expected to affect soil organic matter (SOM)
   transformations within forestry systems. A likely consequence is the
   development of post-fire litter layers composed of thermally altered
   non-senescent materials that have fallen during a fire event. In this
   study, Pinus radiata needles were thermally altered to determine the
   effect of changes in carbon chemistry on needle decomposition and
   nitrogen cycling. Live needles were collected and dried at 40 degrees C
   before being further heated for 1 h in a muffle furnace at a range of
   temperatures > 40 degrees C (max. = 320 degrees C) to simulate a range
   of canopy temperatures that can occur during a fire, and then coarsely
   ground and screened (0.5-1.0 man fraction retained). These needles were
   characterised for carbon and nitrogen content, and carbon chemistry
   (solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy); they were also used in an
   incubation experiment (14 days) which was performed to assess the impact
   of heating on nitrogen transformations. Soil respiration and extractable
   nitrogen pools (mineral, potentially mineralizable, and microbial
   biomass) were measured throughout the incubation. During the incubation,
   cumulative respiration and nitrogen absorption capacity decreased with
   increasing thermal alteration. The results indicate a step change in the
   response of nitrogen pools to thermal alteration of pine needles, with a
   critical change occurring at or before 200 degrees C. This step change
   in nitrogen response may be due to the thermal degradation of light
   fraction organic matter, simple polysaccharides, or both. From this
   experiment it is clear that a post fire litter layer can have distinctly
   different effects on the soil environment depending on canopy
   temperature conditions during the fire with post fire litters composed
   of low temperature needles absorbing most mineral nitrogen that they
   contact. This will in turn affect post-fire plant recovery and therefore
   ecological succession.}},

Abstract = {{Bark thickness, a key variable determining post-fire tree survival,

   most influential factor determining bark thickness. In this paper, we
   describe the survival rates and variables affecting cork oak survival
   1.5 years after a large wildfire in southern Portugal, with a focus on
   the management of bark exploitation. The status of 1151 cork oaks was
   assessed in 40 plots, and logistic regression used to explore the
   variables affecting survival likelihood, collected at the tree and plot
   levels. Survival rate sampling was 84\%. The most important factors
   affecting survival were those related to the management of cork
   extraction: stripped trees, trees with thinner bark and trees with
   larger diameter, correlated to the number of stripping operations,
   showed lower survival. Survival also decreased with increasing charring
   height. an indicator of fire damage. Stripped trees in unfavourable
   aspects (South to East) also showed lower survival. A survival model was
   built that can be used to identify areas vulnerable to future fires, if

   \% in 2005 to 83 \% in 2009. The increase was derived mostly by the
   vegetative reproduction of shrubs on the unburned surface and by the
   immigration of non-Sphagnum mosses and deciduous trees on the burned
   surface. Deciduous trees, which had not been established before the
   wildfire, colonized only on the burned surface and grew faster than P.

   yet been examined. We used 35 regenerating and old-growth stands of
   Caatinga to examine the recovery of plant assemblages subsequent to
   slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle ranching/pasture in northeastern
   Brazil. Plant assemblages were contrasted in terms of community
   structure (stem density/basal area/species richness/diversity),
   functional (leaf habit/reproductive traits) and taxonomic composition.
   Soil attributes were also examined to infer potential drivers for
   cross-habitat differences. As expected, plant assemblages clearly
   differed across a large set of community-level attributes, including all
   trait categories relative to leaf habit and reproduction (pollination
   syndrome/floral color, size, type). Overall, old-growth forest stands
   supported distinct and more diverse assemblages at the plot and habitat
   level; e.g., long-lived tree species were almost exclusively found in
   old-growth forest stands. For most attributes, plant assemblages
   subsequent to pasture exhibited intermediate values between those
   exhibited by old-growth forest and those of agriculture-related stands.
   Surprisingly, soils exhibited similar fertility-related scores across
   habitats. Our results indicate that: (1) sprouting/resprouting
   represents an important mechanism of forest regeneration; (2)
   assemblage-level attributes suggest recovery at distinct rates; (3)
   forest regeneration implies community-level changes in both vegetative
   and reproductive functional attributes, including directional changes;
   (4) Caatinga is not able to completely recover in a period of 15-yr
   following land abandonment; and (5) historical land use affects recovery
   rates and successional pathways/taxonomic trajectories. Seasonally dry
   tropical forests may intrinsically cover a wide range of patterns
   relative to successional model, recovery rates and successional
   pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments aim to reduce
   runoff-erosion risks following forest fires by counteracting the impact
   of fire on key soil and hillslope properties. Here we evaluate the
   effectiveness of wood shred mulch, long-leaved pine needle mulch, and
   polyacrylamide (PAM) in reducing post-fire runoff and erosion in two
   volcanic soil types of contrasting wettability using rainfall
   simulations (55 mm h(-1) for 30 min) at the microplot (0.25 m(2)) scale.
   The cover provided by the wood shreds and pine needles led to a
   reduction of runoff and erosion in both the wettable-(62\% and 92\%,
   respectively, for wood shreds, and 55\% and 87\%, respectively, for
   needle mulch) and the extremely water-repellent soils (44\% and 61\%,
   respectively, for wood shreds). In contrast to what might be expected,
   PAM did not reduce runoff or erosion when applied to the extremely
   water-repellent soils, suggesting that PAM should not be applied in this
   terrain type. Although more research is needed to determine whether the
   high effectiveness of pine needle mulch and wood shred mulch fully
   translates to coarser scales, the results are encouraging in terms of
   these materials' ability to provide effective and relatively economic
   mitigation treatments for fire-induced runoff-erosion risks in volcanic

   examining the post-fire succession, we analysed the survival of eggs and

   tits occupied more nest boxes and laid more eggs that suffered less
   predation than in earlier successional stages. Although the incubation
   fate improved at each step of succession, the conditions to fully raise
   nestlings seemed to be suitable only in the oldest woods. Our findings
   indicate that the population dynamics of a reputed generalist avian

Abstract = {{Environmental filtering-abiotic and biotic constraints on the
   demographic performance of individual organisms-is a widespread
   mechanism of selection in communities. A given individual is ``filtered
   out{''} (i. e., selectively removed) when environmental conditions or
   disturbances like fires preclude its survival and reproduction. Although
   interactions between these filters and dispersal from the regional
   species pool are thought to determine much about species composition
   locally, there have been relatively few studies of dispersal 9 filtering
   interactions in species-rich communities and fewer still where fire is
   also a primary selective agent. We experimentally manipulated dispersal
   and filtering by fire (pre-fire fuel loads and post-fire ash) in
   species-rich groundcover communities of the longleaf pine ecosystem. We
   tested four predictions: (1) That species richness would increase with
   biologically realistic dispersal (seed addition); (2) that the immediate
   effect of increased fuels in burned communities would be to decrease
   species richness, whereas the longer-term effects of increased fuels
   would be to open recruitment opportunities in the groundcover, increase
   species richness, and increase individual performance (growth) of
   immigrating species; (3) that adding ash would increase species
   richness; and (4) that increased dispersal would generate larger
   increases in species richness in plots with increased fuels compared to
   plots with decreased fuels. We found that dispersal interacted with
   complex fire-generated filtering during and after fires. Dispersal
   increased species richness more in burned communities with increased and
   decreased fuels compared to burned controls. Moreover, individuals of
   immigrating species generally grew to larger sizes in burned communities
   with increased fuels compared to burned controls. In contrast to
   dispersal and fuels, ash had no effect on species richness directly or
   in combination with other treatments. We conclude that filtering occurs
   both during fires and in the post-fire environment and that these
   influences interact with dispersal such that the consequences are only
   fully revealed when all are considered in combination. Our experiment
   highlights the importance of considering the dynamic interplay of
   dispersal and selection in the assembly of species-rich communities.}},

Abstract = {{Grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) are an important structural component of many
   Australian ecosystems and also an important resource for many fauna
   species. Grasstrees have distinctive morphologies, with a crown of long
   thin leaves and skirts, the latter of which are accumulated dead leaves;
   both are incinerated by fire. This study determined the morphological
   features of Xanthorrhoea preissii, which change in response to fire from
   6 months to 21 years post-burn. In addition, using radio-telemetry and
   spool-tracking, we determined that grasstrees are utilised as foraging
   and nesting resources for mardos (Antechinus flavipes leucogaster (Gray,
   1841), Marsupialia: Dasyuridae). Recently burnt grasstrees (6 months
   post-burn) appeared not to be used by mardos at all. We found few mardos
   in these recently burnt sites, and the one individual we managed to
   track for 126 m utilised only a single grasstree: a 2-m-tall
   multiple-crowned grasstree that had escaped the fire was used as a nest
   site. For sites 5 years post-burn, mardos selectively utilised
   grasstrees with larger crown areas and those with a greater number of
   crowns compared with a random sample of available trees. At the 14-year
   post-burn sites, mardos still demonstrated some selection for
   grasstrees, although no specific single feature could be determined as
   most significant. We recorded humidity and temperature buffering effects
   in association with post-burn accumulation of grasstree skirt material
   and found that even dead grasstree `logs' were an important resource for
   nests. We conclude that mardos utilise both live and dead grasstrees for
   foraging and nest sites, possibly owing to the availability of dense
   cover, a buffered microclimate, and potentially also food resources.
   Fire-management policies that promote habitat heterogeneity and retain
   several intact-skirted grasstrees within the landscape are likely to
   benefit mardos.}},

   Twenty nine circular plots (5 m radius) were established based on (1)

   Sapling size, annual growth and stem biomass were higher in thinned

   declined five years after thinning. Cone counts were higher 2-5 years

   Thinning accelerated stand maturity but positive effects were

Abstract = {{Land use, climate change, and their interaction each have great
   potential to affect grazing systems. With anticipated more frequent and
   extensive future drought, a more complete understanding of the
   mechanisms that determine large grazer landscape-level distribution
   under varying climatic conditions is integral to ecosystem management.
   Using an experimental setting with contrasting fire treatments, we
   describe the inter-annual variability of the effect of landscape
   topography and disturbance from prescribed spring fire on large grazer
   space use in years of variable resource availability. Using GPS
   telemetry, we investigated space use of plains bison (Bison bison bison)
   as they moved among watersheds managed with variable experimental burn
   treatments (1-, 2-, 4-, and 20-year burn intervals) during a seven-year
   period spanning years of average-to-above average forage production and
   severe drought. At the landscape scale, bison more strongly favored
   high-elevation and recently burned watersheds with watersheds burned for
   the first time in 2 or 4 yr consistently showing higher use relative to
   annually burned watersheds. In particular, watersheds burned for the
   first time in 4 yr were avoided to lesser extent than other more
   frequently burned watersheds during the dormant season. This management
   type also maintained coupling between bison space use and post-fire
   regrowth across post-drought growing season months, whereas watersheds
   with more frequent fire-return intervals attracted bison in only the
   first month post-fire. Hence, fire frequency played a role in
   maintaining the coupling of grazer and post-fire regrowth, the
   fire-grazer interaction, in response to drought-induced reduction in
   fuel loads. Moreover, bison avoided upland habitat in poor forage
   production years, when forage regrowth is less likely to occur in upland
   than in lowland habitats. Such quantified responses of bison to
   landscape features can aid future conservation management efforts and
   planning to sustain fire-grazer interactions and resulting spatial
   heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{421-430}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Germination studies of species from fire-prone
   habitats are often focused on the role that fire plays in breaking
   dormancy. However, for some plant groups in these habitats, such as the
   genus Leucopogon (Ericaceae), dormancy of fresh seeds is not broken by
   fire cues. In the field, these same species display a flush of seedling
   emergence post-fire. Dormancy and germination mechanisms therefore
   appear complex and mostly unknown. This study aimed to identify these
   mechanisms by establishing dormancy class and testing the effects of a
   set of typical germination cues, including those directly related to
   fire and entirely independent of fire.
   Methods To classify dormancy, we assessed seed permeability and embryo
   morphology, and conducted germination experiments at seasonal
   temperatures in incubators. To test the effects of fire cues on
   germination, factorial combinations of smoke, heat and dark treatments
   were applied. Ageing treatments, using burial and seasonal incubation,
   were also tested. Germination phenology was established.
   Key Results Seeds were dormant at release and had underdeveloped
   embryos. Primary dormancy of the study species was classified as
   morphophysiological. Seasonal temperature changes overcame primary
   dormancy and controlled timing of germination. Fire cues did not break
   primary dormancy, but there was a trend for smoke to enhance germination
   once this dormancy was overcome.
   Conclusions Despite the fact that fire is a predominant disturbance and
   that many species display a flush of emergence post-fire, seasonal
   temperatures broke the primary physiological dormancy of the study
   species. It is important to distinguish between fire being responsible
   for breaking dormancy and solely having a role in enhancing levels of
   post-fire germination for seeds in which dormancy has been overcome by
   other factors. Biogeographical evidence suggests that morphological and
   physiological factors, and therefore seasonal temperatures, are likely
   to be important in controlling the dormancy and patterns of post-fire
   germination of many species in fire-prone regions.}},

Abstract = {{The process of post-fire recovery in mixed Siberian spruce-Scots pine
   forests (Picea obovataLedeb.-Pinus sylvestrisL.), typical for the
   European North-West, was studied in the Kola peninsula (Russia). We used
   the spatial-temporal approach to reveal the size structure (diameter at
   breast height (DBH) distribution) and vital state of Siberian spruce and
   Scots pine stands, tree regeneration and species structure of the dwarf
   shrub-herb and lichen-moss layers at different stages of post-fire
   succession (8-380 years after the fire). It was found that in both
   forest-forming species, the process of stand stratification results in
   the allocation of two size groups of trees. In Siberian spruce, these
   groups persist throughout the succession. In Scots pine, DBH
   distributions become more homogeneous at the middle of succession
   (150-200 years after the fire) due to the extinction of small-size
   individuals. Siberian spruce stands are dominated by moderately and
   strongly weakened trees at all succession stages. The vitality status of
   Scots pine stands is higher compared to Siberian spruce up to 150 years
   after a fire. The dynamics of regeneration activity is similar in both
   species, with a minimum at the middle of the restoration period. The
   results indicate that in Siberian spruce-Scots pine forests, the stand
   structure and regeneration activity differs substantially in the first
   half of succession (up to 200 years after the fire) and become similar
   in the late-succession community. The study of lower layers revealed
   that the cover of moss-lichen and dwarf shrub-herb layers stabilize 150
   years after a fire. Changes in species structure in both layers are
   observed until the late stage of succession. The originality of the
   structure and dynamics of mixed Siberian spruce-Scots pine forests is
   revealed based on a comparison with pure Siberian spruce forests in the

   reducing erosion after a June 2000 wildfire northwest of Loveland,
   Colorado. Site characteristics and sediment yields were measured on 12
   burned and untreated control plots and 22 burned and treated plots from
   2000 to 2003. The size of the hillslope plots ranged from 0.015 to 0.86
   ha.
   Sediment yields varied significantly by treatment and were most closely
   correlated with the amount of ground cover. On the control plots the
   mean sediment yield declined from 6-10 Mg ha(-1) in the first two years
   after burning to 1.2 Mg ha(-1) in 2002 and 0.7 Mg ha(-1) in 2003.
   Natural regrowth caused the amount of ground cover on the control plots
   to increase progressively from 33\% in fall 2000 to 88\% in fall 2003.
   Seeding had no effect on either the amount of ground cover or sediment
   yields. Mulching reduced sediment yields by at least 95\% relative to
   the control plots in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and the lower sediment yields
   are attributed to an immediate increase in the amount of ground cover in
   the mulched plots. The contour-felling treatments varied considerably in
   the quality of installation, and sediment storage capacities ranged from
   7 to 32 m(3) ha(-1). The initial contour-felling treatment did not
   reduce sediment yields when subjected to a very large storm event, but
   sediment yields were significantly reduced by a contour-felling
   treatment installed after this large storm. The results indicate that
   contour felling may be able to store much of the sediment generated in
   an average year, but will not reduce sediment yields from larger storms.

Abstract = {{Fire is both a natural disturbance and a range management tool in the
   savannas of Elionorus muticus (Spreng) O. Kuntze, of the Chaco region of
   Argentina. Our objective was to assess the effect of different dates of
   fire application on the herbaceous diversity of the savanna. Plots were
   burn at random in four successive dates, in two experiments initiated in
   1993 and 1994, respectively. Richness and abundance of grasses and
   broadleaf species were registered in each plot, before the fire and
   after three growing seasons from fire. Data were summarized using the
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'). A variable DeltaH' was defined as
   the difference between the H' observed before and after the fire for
   each plot/year, and used as dependent variable in an ANOVA; fire
   application date, experiment, their interaction and year of observation
   (t) were considered as independent variables, with a repeated measures
   approach. Results indicate that although fire increased herbaceous
   diversity significantly, this general outcome was significantly modified
   by the date of fire application. This result is attributed to the pre
   and post fire environmental conditions as well as the phenological
   status of the species. Fire application at the mid-fire season generates
   higher diversity than any other time, probably due to plant resistance
   and better post fire environmental conditions.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{533-539}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The control of invasive alien plants is one of the major tasks facing
   conservation managers of South African fynbos vegetation. Extensive
   clearance work currently is underway, but the ultimate success of these
   operations depends upon good indigenous vegetation recovery. Fynbos
   species potentially may recruit from persistent seed banks in the soil,
   but surface seed banks may become depleted under dense aliens and deeper
   seed banks may fall to germinate. In this study, the effect on fynbos
   recovery of disturbing the soil mechanically, to a depth of 100-150 mm,
   following alien clearance, was investigated. It was hypothesised that
   soil disturbance would promote germination from persistent, soil-stored
   seed banks. It was further hypothesised that soil disturbance would have
   a greater effect following high compared to low fire intensities. Soil
   disturbance had no effect on total plant recruitment. There was a
   significant negative relationship between fire intensity and plant
   density two years post-fire. Recruitment levels at the study site were
   low compared to those at sites invaded for two to three decades. This
   indicates that fynbos seed persistence may decline rapidly after four
   decades of burial. Soil disturbance resulted in higher indigenous
   species richness and projected canopy cover at the final census, two
   years post-fire, Changes to guild structure following soil disturbance
   included an increase in the cover of shrubs relative to graminoids and
   forbs, and small-seeded species relative to larger-seeded myrmecochorous
   species. Soil disturbance caused similar changes to guild structure in
   both high and low fire intensity plots. Soil disturbance is not
   recommended as a universal treatment following the clearance of dense
   stands of aliens. Used in conjunction with indigenous sowing, it may
   improve restoration at long-invaded, deep-soil sites, following fires of
   unnaturally high intensity. Post-fire soil disturbance should promote
   species richness in seedling recruits, plant growth conditions and the
   development of vegetation cover, while sowing would increase plant
   density and re-introduce guilds not present in relict soil seed banks.}},

   were magnitude, total external pathlength, and altitude of the root
   system. Results clearly evidenced greater plasticity in root system
   topology of P. halepensis than C. monspeliensis saplings. Herringbone
   architecture (i.e., the most ordered pattern possible, with branching
   confined to the main axis) characterised small pine saplings, regardless
   of competition from C. monspeliensis, and changed to random branching
   throughout sapling development. In middle growth stages, however, the

   configuration changes in root branching. In contrast, C. monspeliensis
   invariably adopted randomly branched architecture, regardless of

Title = {{Post-fire morel (Morchella) mushroom abundance, spatial structure, and
   harvest sustainability}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{377}},
Pages = {{16-25}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Morel mushrooms are globally distributed, socially and economically
   important reproductive structures produced by fungi of the genus
   Morchella. Morels are highly prized edible mushrooms and significant
   harvests are collected throughout their range, especially in the first
   year after fire, when some morel species fruit prolifically. Few studies
   have quantified post-fire morel mushroom abundance, despite their
   widespread human use. The purpose of this study is to provide the first
   ever estimate of post-fire morel mushroom abundance in Sierra Nevada
   mixed-conifer forest. Specifically, we estimate the abundance and
   spatial variability of morel mushrooms across an intensively mapped and
   measured forest research site during the first growing season following
   fire.
   We conducted this study in the Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot, a
   long-term forest research installation located in old-growth
   mixed-conifer forest of Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We
   surveyed for morel mushrooms in n = 1119 contiguous circular 3.14 m(2)
   plots arranged along 2240 m of permanently marked, georeferenced
   transects. We characterized the spatial correlation of morel plots using
   k category (multicolor) join count statistics. We analyzed spatial
   correlations at interplot distances up to 9.0 m.
   There were 595 morel mushrooms in the 1119 plots we measured. Mushrooms
   occurred in 17.8\% of plots. We estimated a mean standing crop of 1693
   morels ha(-1) (SE = 155.4 morels ha(-1)). Morel occupied plots were
   strongly and significantly spatially autocorrelated. Most of the spatial
   correlation among morel-occupied plots was apparent at scales up to 7.0
   m, and was strongest at scales <3.0 m.
   This study is one of only four that provide unbiased estimates of
   post-fire morel abundance. Our morel abundance estimates are generally
   consistent with prior work in high-latitude North American conifer
   forests. The strong spatial autocorrelation of morel-occupied microsites
   at scales <7 m indicates that key factors controlling post-fire morel
   productivity are heterogeneous at small spatial scales. We propose a
   simple conceptual model to explain this spatial structure that includes
   spatial variability of pre-fire Morchella colonies; pre-fire vegetation
   community and fuelbed; fire behavior, intensity, and effects; and soil
   moisture and temperature. Relatively liberal harvest limits for
   recreational and subsistence harvesters appear appropriate and
   sustainable, at least for coniferous forests in the first year following
   fire. However, intensive commercial harvest, in jurisdictions where it
   is allowed, may warrant monitoring to assess potential impacts to
   long-term morel productivity, conflict with recreational harvesters, and
   non-target effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei Buchh.) plants of all
   sizes was compared between paired burned and unburned plots in four
   savanna sites on the eastern Edwards Plateau. Smaller plants were less
   likely to survive a fire than larger plants, over the entire range of
   plant sizes. Overall fire survival rates varied from similar to 45\% (0-
   to 50-cm-tall plants) to similar to 92\% (> 2-m-tall plants). The high
   rate of survival of small plants indicates that fires like those
   typically used in this region are not likely to control even the early
   stages of the encroachment of Ashe juniper. If fire is to be used to
   maintain savannas in this region, multiple burns, more intense fires, or
   supplementary mechanical removal will probably be needed. junipers 0 to
   200 cm tall were significantly more likely to be growing under the
   canopy of a tree (defined as a plant > 2 m tall of any species) than in
   the open. Small (0 to 50 cm tall) junipers under a tree canopy were
   significantly more likely to be alive than plants in the same size class
   growing in the open, suggesting facilitation of small Ashe juniper by
   neighboring trees. There was, however, no significant effect of
   neighboring trees on the rate at which small Ashe juniper survived fire,
   contrary to our initial expectation.}},

Abstract = {{Dense midstorey vegetation, developed during fire exclusion, not only
   reduces understorey plant diversity and increases the risk of damaging
   wildfire but also impedes efforts to safely restore prescribed burning
   in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems. Our study examined
   the effects of midstorey reduction on stand structure and plant
   diversity in a forest treated by mulching alone and also when followed
   by prescribed fire during the winter, spring or summer. For trees >= 5
   cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.), mulching reduced stand density
   (1220-258 trees ha(-1)) and basal area (24-17.7 m(2) ha(-1)) and
   increased mean d.b.h. (12.8-29.2 cm), with the largest reductions in
   loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.)
   and oaks (Quercus spp. L.). Removing hardwoods and smaller pines
   resulted in a decline in tree species richness (8.9-4.4). Despite a
   modest increase in evenness (0.72-0.79), tree species diversity (H' =
   1.32-0.84) dynamics were largely driven by changes in richness. While
   the cover of tree seedlings initially declined from 32.4 to 16.9 per
   cent, rapid regrowth of hardwoods led to recovery by end of the second
   growing season. This, along with gains by shrubs, vines, grasses and
   forbs, resulted in a near doubling of understorey plant cover. Although
   tree seedling increases were not related to fire season, peak responses
   occurred for shrubs and vines after winter fire and spring fire, grasses
   following winter fire and forbs after summer fire. An increase in
   species richness (18.7-24.5) and decline in species evenness (0.86-0.70)
   produced only a small increase in understorey species diversity (H' =
   2.31-2.45). The greater number of understorey species following
   treatment were less equitably distributed as a result of differential
   rates of plant growth. While mulching led to a short-term increase in
   woody and herbaceous understorey plants, prescribed fire is needed to
   curtail redevelopment of the woody midstorey and further increase
   grasses and forbs.}},

Abstract = {{The accelerated erosion that occurs after wildfire in forest ecosystems

   Soil erosion prediction models are crucial for estimating fire impacts
   and for planning post-fire soil stabilization measures. We evaluated the
   performance of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the
   Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment (PESERA) models by comparing
   the soil losses predicted by the models and the soil losses measured in
   the first year after wildfires in NW Spain. Two alternative RUSLE
   approaches were also considered: i) the use of reduction coefficients
   for R and C factors and ii) the application of a soil erodibility
   reduction factor to take into account soil surface stone cover. The
   RUSLE model overestimated the observed erosion rates in all cases. The
   PESERA model performed reasonably well in predicting soil losses, but
   needs a better characterization of soil burn severity in the soil inputs
   (crusting and erodibility) because of the high sensitivity of the model
   to these parameters.
   In both cases, there is an urgent need for an appropriate assessment of
   the impact on soil burn severity in the erosional process. This seems
   critical if these models are to be used for post-fire soil stabilization

Abstract = {{Little is known of the effects of fire on lesser prairie-chicken

   of habitat variables were measured at 1 and 2 years post-fire. During
   both periods, canopy coverage of shrubs decreased (P less than or equal

   (P=0.007) with fall and spring burning at 1 year post-fire. Visual
   obstruction in May and January decreased (P less than or equal to0.001)

   spring burning and winter (January) forb frequency increased (P=0.047)
   190\% with burning in all seasons. Prescribed fire appears to be an
   effective tool to increase abundance of growing-season forbs and sedges,
   winter forbs, and grasshoppers associated with quality foraging and
   brooding habitat. Nesting habitat and thermal and escape cover are
   impacted negatively by fire, particularly spring fire, due to a
   reduction in overhead and horizontal cover and reduced abundance of
   important nesting grasses. Our data suggest a 2- to 3-year recovery
   period for nesting habitat following burning. Negative impacts of fire
   on nesting habitat and thermal and escape cover can be reduced by
   burning in seasons other than spring, decreasing burn size, and
   interspersing burned and unburned areas.}},

   decreased. The main reasons for increased tree regeneration were
   attributed to (1) reduction of litter depth, and (2) increase in
   available light from opening of the canopy and reduction in shrub
   competition. It is apparent that the forest is on a path to return to
   its natural state before the fire after 37 years.}},

Abstract = {{In the Rocky Mountain Forest District of British Columbia. a dramatic
   series of fires occurred during 2003, setting the stage for an abundant
   morel crop in the following year. During 2004. the abundance of
   post-fire morels (Morchella spp.) was measured and the plant community
   associated with morel production wits characterized. Morel production
   averaged 6473 +/- 2721 morels.ha(-1) in five burnt forests that were
   surveyed. Production ranged from 1702.ha(-1) at Plumbob Mountain to a
   significantly higher 16827.ha(-1) in the Kootenay National Park, where
   the highest level of duff consumption (71\%) was also observed. Several
   plant species had high importance in morel habitat. and were also
   associated with above-average morel abundance: Chamerion angustifolium
   (L.) Holub, Arnica cordifolia Hook., Erythronium grandiflorum Pursh,
   Spiraea betulifolia Pallas subsp. lucida (Dougl. ex Greene) Taylor and

   Engelm.. Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., and Picea glauca (Moench) Voss
   x engelmannii (Torn. \& Gray ex Hook.) Brayshaw. Compositae and
   Vaccinium spp. were important species when considered as groups. Grass
   species, including Calamagrostis rubescens Buckl., were more proximate

   managers need to balance dead tree removal and habitat requirements for

   methods to develop predictive models of white-headed woodpecker
   (Picoides albolarvatus) nesting habitat in postfire ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated landscapes on the Fremont-Winema National
   Forests in south central Oregon, USA. The 1-km radius (314 ha)
   surrounding 45 nest sites was open-canopied before fire and a mosaic of
   burn severities after wildfire. The 1-ha surrounding nests of
   white-headed woodpeckers had fewer live trees per hectare and more
   decayed and larger diameter snags than at non-nest sites. The leading
   cause of nest failure seemed to be predation. Habitat and abiotic
   features were not associated with nest survival. High daily survival
   rates and little variation within habitat features among nest locations
   suggest white-headed woodpeckers were consistently selecting high
   suitability habitats. Management activities that open the forest canopy
   and create conditions conducive to a mosaic burn pattern will probably
   provide suitable white-headed woodpecker nesting habitat after wildfire.
   When making postfire salvage logging decisions, we suggest that
   retention of larger, more decayed snags will provide nesting habitat in
   recently burned forests.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is the dominant stand-renewing disturbance through much of the
   Canadian boreal forest, with large high-intensity crown fires being
   common. From 1 to 3 million ha have burned on average during the past 80
   years, with 6 years in the past two decades experiencing more than 4
   million ha burned. A large-fire database that maps forest fires greater
   than 200 ha in area in Canada is being developed to catalogue historical
   fires. However, analyses using a regional climate model suggest that a
   changing climate caused by increasing greenhouse gases may alter fire
   weather, contributing to an increased area burned in the future. Direct
   carbon emissions from fire (combustion) are estimated to average 27 Tg
   carbon year(-1) for 1959-1999 in Canada. Post-fire decomposition may be
   of a similar magnitude, and the regenerating forest has a different
   carbon sink strength. Measurements indicate that there is a net carbon
   release (source) by the forest immediately after the fire before
   vegetation is re-established. Daytime downward carbon fluxes over a
   burned forest take 1-3 decades to recover to those of a mature forest,
   but the annual carbon balance has not yet been measured. There is a
   potential positive feedback to global climate change, with anthropogenic
   greenhouse gases stimulating fire activity through weather changes, with
   fire releasing more carbon while the regenerating forest is a smaller
   carbon sink. However, changes in fuel type need to be considered in this
   scenario since fire spreads more slowly through younger deciduous
   forests. Proactive fuel management is evaluated as a potential mechanism
   to reduce area burned. However, it is difficult to envisage that such
   treatments could be employed successfully at the national scale, at
   least over the next few decades, because of the large scale of
   treatments required and ecological issues related to forest
   fragmentation and biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal mixedwoods are an important element and the most productive
   forest type in the Canadian boreal forests. However, they experience
   frequent disturbances. In order to better understand the responses of
   boreal mixedwoods to different combinations of anthropogenic and natural
   disturbances, we investigated the natural regeneration of boreal
   mixedwoods that were previously subjected to three different harvesting
   treatments (clearcut, partial-cut and uncut control) and naturally
   regenerated, but subsequently burnt by a severe natural fire 6 years
   later. The study was conducted 8 years following the fire. Significant
   interactions were found among harvesting method, species and block in
   several regeneration variables. There were a total of 12 woody species
   (trees and shrubs) regenerated, but not all the species were present in
   all the sites. In general, the species richness and species diversity of
   the new stands were lowest on clearcut sites while the differences
   between partial-cut and control varied with blocks. However, the
   combined total density for all species was lowest on uncut control
   sites. Density and regeneration index data show that trembling aspen was
   the predominant tree species in all stands except at one uncut control
   site where jack pine was the dominant species. The density of trembling
   aspen generally declined from clearcut to partial to the uncut control.
   Pincherry, beaked hazel and mountain maple were the dominant shrub
   species in the new stands, but no general patterns were found in terms
   of variations in density with harvesting methods for any of the shrub
   species. jack pine and white birch were the tallest tree species in the
   clearcut treatment while white birch was taller than jack pine in the
   partial-cut and control. The results suggest that active measures are
   necessary to restore the complex structure of the initial mixedwoods.

Abstract = {{Villages in the countryside hinterland of Hong Kong traditionally
   preserve small remnant woodlands for utilitarian and spiritual reasons.
   In the territory, these remnants often furnish the most natural
   ecosystems with rich biodiversity. Some sites have been preserved,
   whereas others have been subject to different uses, and subsequently
   secondary woodland has reestablished. This study evaluates woodland and
   human influences on soil properties, and soil recovery after woodland
   rejuvenation. At nine sites, four classified as less disturbed (LD) and
   five as more disturbed (MD), physical and chemical properties are
   similar to those of impoverished humid-tropical soils. However, the MD
   samples have greater stone content and aggregate stability than the LD.
   MD samples also have higher pH, lower C/N ratios, more exchangeable Ca
   and Mg, and higher base saturation. The MD soil properties are
   attributed to tree felling in the 1940s and short-lived conversion to
   farmland or orchard, followed by secondary woodland succession dominated
   by native broadleaf trees. Two MD sites, one converted to an urban park
   in 1970 and the other burnt by a severe hill fire in 1999, have soil
   imprints of drastic disturbance. The nutrient content of MD soils at
   this early stage of ecosystem succession suggests rapid accumulation of
   nutrients. Five decades of secondary succession at three of the MD sites
   have resulted in natural soil rehabilitation. Conservation of these
   ecologically valuable woodlands should avoid unnecessary silvicultural
   inputs such as planting exotic species and soil disturbance, and
   conversion to unnatural uses such as recreational sites. In addition,
   the soils should be managed for improvement to help ecosystem
   recuperation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Survival of planted seedlings after 5 years was 70\%, with most deaths

   establishment. Survival did not show any relationship with seed
   provenance or microsite characteristics. Height growth averaged 34.6 +/-
   1.2 cm in 5 years. Seedlings produced from seeds collected in a
   well-preserved woodland grew taller and showed a higher tendency for
   development of shrubby habit than those produced from seeds collected in
   a degraded woodland. Seedlings planted in more degraded microsites with
   exposed soil or rock due to past grazing pressure grew less and
   developed a more shrubby habit than those planted in better preserved

Title = {{Seed and seedling ecology of pinon and juniper species in the pygmy
   woodlands of western North America}},
Journal = {{BOTANICAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-38}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the seed and seedling ecology of the pinon and juniper
   woodlands of western North America is essential for understanding both
   the northward migration and expansion of the woodlands during the
   Holocene (<11,500 B.P.), and the accelerated expansion of the woodlands
   since settlement of the West by Anglo-Americans around 200 years ago. We
   follow the fates of seeds and seedlings of the different pinon and
   juniper species within the woodlands from seed development to seedling
   establishment, and discuss the implications of this information for the
   past and present expansion of the woodlands. While seed development
   requires about two and one-half years in pinons, it is species-dependent
   in junipers and can take one, two, or even three years. Substantial seed
   lasses can occur during seed development due to developmental
   constraints, and before or after seed maturation as a result of insects,
   pathogens, or predatory animals. In pinon pines, the primary seed
   dispersers are scatter-hoarding birds (corvids) and rodents that harvest
   seeds from the trees or after seed fall and cache them in the soil. In
   contrast, most junipers appear to be dispersed primarily by frugivorous
   birds and mammals that ingest the seeds and defecate them onto the soil
   surface. We have recently documented that scatter-hoarding rodents also
   disperse juniper seeds. Disperser effectiveness, or the contribution a
   disperser makes to the future reproduction of a plant population, may
   vary among species of pinons and especially junipers. Pinon seeds are
   short-lived and exhibit little dormancy, and they probably only
   germinate the spring following dispersal. Juniper seeds are long-lived
   and seed dispersal can occur over one or more years. Seed germination
   can be delayed for several years due to impermeable seed coats, embryo
   dormancy, or the presence of inhibitors. Seedling establishment of pinon
   pines is facilitated by nurse plants but, while junipers often establish
   beneath nurse plants, they are capable of establishing in open
   environments. In the southwestern United States, higher establishment of
   juniper occurs in open environments due to more favorable precipitation,
   and competition may be more important than facilitation in determining
   establishment.
   When considering the mechanisms involved in the past and present
   expansion of the woodlands, short-distance dispersal, local population
   growth, and long-distance dispersal are all important. Different classes
   of dispersers, some of which appear to have coevolved with the tree
   species, appear to be responsible for local (short-distance) vs.
   long-distance dispersal in pinons and junipers. Because ecotones form
   the interface between the woodlands and adjacent communities, they can
   provide valuable information on both the seed dispersal and seedling
   establishment processes responsible for tree expansion.
   Disturbance regimes and, recently, the effects of humans on those
   regimes have major effects on the expansion and contraction of the
   woodlands. Before Anglo-American settlement, fires occurred as
   frequently as every 50-100 years throughout much of the woodlands.
   During this century, fire frequencies have been reduced due to the
   indirect effects of livestock grazing and the direct effects of removing
   Native Americans from the ecosystem and implementing active
   fire-prevention programs. The result has been an increase in
   tree-dominated successional stages at the expense of grass-dominated
   stages. Various management techniques, including controlled burning and
   chaining, have been implemented to reduce tree dominance, but their
   effects depend largely on the life histories of the tree species and the
   disturbance characteristics. Several areas relating to the seed and
   seedling ecology of the pinon and juniper require additional research if
   we are to truly understand the dynamics of the woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Proper management of naturally forested landscapes requires knowledge of
   key disturbance processes and their effects on species composition and
   structure. Spatially-intensive fire and forest histories provide
   valuable information about how fire and vegetation may vary and interact
   on heterogeneous landscapes. I constructed 800-year fire and tree
   recruitment chronologies for two eastern Great Basin fire-sheds using
   fire-scar and tree establishment evidence from 48 gridded plots (500 m
   spacing) and from fire-scarred trees between plots. Fire-sheds are
   located in the Snake Range of eastern Nevada (BMC) and Wah Wah Range of
   western Utah (LAW) and span a range in elevation and vegetation zones
   typical for the region. Estimates of point mean fire interval varied
   more than 10-fold at both BMC (7.8-125.6 years) and LAW (13.3-138.4
   years). At BMC, a distinct within-fire-shed contrast in fire frequency
   was difficult to explain without invoking the possibility of
   spatially-variable human-caused ignitions. A majority of fires were
   small (<10 ha) but large fires (>= 100 ha) accounted for 78\% (BMC) to
   89\% (LAW) of cumulative area burned. Tree recruitment for
   mid-elevation, mixed-conifer stands was somewhat episodic and
   asynchronous among plots. Recruitment pulses were synchronous with
   multi-decade fire quiescent periods, and often followed large fires. I
   concluded that fire frequency was under strong topographic control and
   that fire severity was mixed and variable through time and space
   resulting in a dynamic mosaic of variable-aged, fire-initiated
   vegetation intermixed with long-lived, fire-resilient trees and open
   shrub-steppe communities (BMC). A major change in fire regime and forest
   composition began in the 1800s causing shifts in composition and
   structure at the stand scale and homogenization at the landscape scale.
   I recommend that management strategies prioritize the use of fire and
   surrogate treatments on mid-elevation forests that have deviated most
   from historic conditions and on associated shrub-steppe communities
   where conifer encroachment has occurred. Planned disturbances should be
   of mixed severity and sized to recreate vegetative mosaics at historic
   spatial scales. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the distribution and abundance of ground-dwelling mammals in
   13 areas involving 42 eucalypt communities within 500 000 ha of eucalypt
   forest in south-eastern New South Wales. Data are presented on the
   relative abundance and distribution of mammals in relation to the
   complexity of the habitat of the vegetation communities, basal area of
   the trees, and indices of nutrients in the foliage of the trees.
   For all ground-dwelling mammals except common wombat, large wallaby and
   red fox there was no positive correlation with foliage nutrients,
   nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, which have been found to be
   important for the arboreal fauna. Abundances of native small mammals
   were positively correlated with foliage magnesium and habitat complexity
   and negatively with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. However, habitat
   complexity was more important than the nutrient status; small mammals
   were present at all nutrient levels, but their abundance fell
   substantially as habitat complexity decreased. Also, the influence of
   nutrients was masked in habitats of high complexity; there was no
   relationship with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and a negative
   relationship with magnesium.
   Sites with a high basal area of trees had a sparse understorey of
   shrubs. Abundances of some herbivorous mammals such as eastern grey
   kangaroo were positively correlated with the basal area of trees and
   negatively with habitat complexity, which indicates their preference for
   forest with an open understorey. The predators, dingo,red fox and cat,
   were found in all categories of the variables, with cat positively
   correlated with basal area and negatively with magnesium and red fox the
   opposite. Dingo was positively correlated with habitat complexity.
   The composition of the ground-dwelling mammal fauna in south-eastern
   forests is determined by the complexity of the understorey. A
   significant reduction in understorey shrubs would result in a decrease
   in the abundance and number of species of small and medium-sized mammals
   and an increase in large grazing mammals. The results are discussed in
   relation to the arboreal fauna and forest management, including the use
   of control burning and grazing by domestic stock.}},

   ecosystems. Fires may affect both the availability and spatial pattern
   of soil nutrients. However, little is known about the effect of fire on
   the spatial pattern of soil resources. We hypothesized that shortly
   after a wildfire, the spatial patterns of soil mineral-N, organic
   labile-N (microbial biomass-N and dissolved organic-N) and extractable-P
   pools would become more clumped because of ash accumulation and
   post-fire deposition of litter around individual adult trees. To test
   this hypothesis, we used plots within a Pinus canariensis forest (with
   both Pinus canariensis and Adenocarpus viscosus present)and sampled them
   one month before and one month after a wildfire. Using geostatistical
   analyses, we examined the spatial patterns of soil mineral-N (NH4-N and
   NO3-N), dissolved organic-N (DON), microbial biomass-N (MB-N) and soil
   extractable-P (PO4-P). Burned plots of P. canariensis and A. viscosus
   both had values that were significantly greater than the unburned plots
   for all variables, except for DON in both cases, and the N:P ratio in
   the case of A. viscosus, which showed significantly lower values. Except
   for DON, we observed an increased spatial dependence and range after a
   fire for all studied variables in the P. canariensis plots (large
   individuals). However, in plots with A. viscosus (smaller individuals),
   we only found differences before and after the fire for the PO4-P and
   DON spatial patterns, Our results confirm the changes in the spatial
   structure of soil variables with fire, and suggest that, on a short-term
   basis, the physical structure of the plant community may determine the
   new spatial structure after fire, with a more clumped distribution
   around large surviving trees and shrubs. The spatial patch size of
   limiting resources has important consequences for the success of
   restoration of forest communities on burned areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Impacts of wildfire on humans are increasing as urban populations
   continue to expand into fire prone landscapes. Effective fire risk
   management can only be achieved if we understand and quantify how
   ecosystems change in response to fire and how these changes affect
   flammability. However, there have been limited studies to this effect
   with the dominant paradigm being the assumption that recently burnt
   vegetation is less flammable than older vegetation. To better quantify
   changes in flammability, we first need to quantify trajectories of
   changes in response to fire within individual vegetation communities.
   Second, we need to examine the extent to which these changes alter
   flammability. Here, we quantify the flammability pathways with
   increasing time since fire for five vegetation communities in
   south-eastern Australia. A total of 116 sites were measured across a
   range of heathland, woodland and forest ecosystems. Flammability was
   measured using an ecological point based mechanistic fire behaviour
   model that estimates three measures of flammability relevant to both
   fire management and research. Predicted changes in flammability varied
   between vegetation types with heathland and wet forests generally
   increasing in flammability with time since fire and tall mixed,
   foothills and forby forests decreasing or showing limited changes with
   time since fire. Variations in flammability pathways suggest fire
   management activities that alter fuel structure, such as prescribed
   burning, may only reduce flammability in a limited set of ecosystems.
   Incorporating these results into a landscape analysis will improve the
   quantification of fire risk.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire effects upon riparian plant community structure, composition,
   and distribution may strongly influence the dynamic relationships
   between riparian vegetation and stream ecosystems. However, few studies
   have examined the influence of fire on these processes. To that end, we
   compared the quantity and composition of allochthonous inputs of plant
   material and terrestrial invertebrates among stream tributaries
   characterized by various degrees of burn severity 5 years post-fire in
   the Frank Church Wilderness of central Idaho, USA. The magnitude of
   inputs of coniferous leaf litter to unburned stream reaches was five
   times that of inputs to severely burned reaches. Deciduous leaf litter
   inputs to unburned reaches were 1.5 times, and inputs of terrestrial
   invertebrates were twice, the magnitude of inputs to severely burned
   reaches. NMS ordination and MRPP analysis indicated that the taxonomic
   composition of terrestrial invertebrate inputs to unburned stream
   reaches was significantly different than the composition of invertebrate
   inputs to either high-severity or low-severity reaches (A = 0.057, p =
   0.040). Unburned and low-severity stream reaches received greater inputs
   of large-bodied invertebrates belonging to the orders Hymenoptera,
   Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, and Diptera. Taken as a whole, our results
   indicate that fire can significantly alter terrestrial-aquatic
   connectivity via alterations in riparian-to-stream inputs of leaf
   material and arthropods. Given these findings, wildfire severity might
   be expected to be a critical factor in shaping stream-riparian food webs

Abstract = {{In April 2000, a large forest fire burned through the largest mountain
   range in the eastern coastal area of the Republic of Korea. Although
   various measures are applied to restore vegetation cover and minimize
   surface soil erosion after forest fires, few studies have quantified
   their effectiveness in the Republic of Korea. The goal of this study was
   to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatments on a slowly
   revegetating hillslope after burning. In 2002, we installed six
   treatments (ground seeding, hydroseeding, tree planting, sodding,
   vegetation sacks, log erosion barriers), examined the vegetation
   coverage and sediment yield in these treated sites, and compared these
   results to those in an untreated site. The results showed that our study
   hillslope, which features a high-severity fire regime, erodible silty
   sands, steep slopes, and frequent high-intensity rainfall, required at
   least 4 years to achieve surface soil stability through the recovery of
   native plant species. However, the rehabilitation treatments achieved
   surface soil stability more quickly. In particular, despite frequent
   high-intensity rainfall, the hydroseeding and vegetation sack treatments
   were highly effective in early recovery because they provided seed
   stability and a high growth rate. The log erosion barrier treatment was
   critically effective in reducing the sediment yield because it provided
   storage spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Attributes of the historical fire regime can influence fauna dynamics by
   moderating vegetation composition and the availability of appropriate

   long-term fire regime are often overlooked. Here we conduct a field
   survey at 27 sites in sub-alpine forests of Namadgi National Park
   (Australia) to determine if one aspect of the historical fire regime,
   inter-fire interval, influences vertebrate fauna and fauna habitat.
   Sites were stratified between three inter-fire interval categories (20,
   65-70 and 83 years between the previous two fires) in areas last burned
   15-years prior to the field survey. All other environmental attributes
   thought to impact vegetation dynamics were controlled for in the study
   design. Fauna activity was monitored for four weeks using trail cameras
   and 15 habitat attributes were assessed using field and remote-sensing
   survey techniques. Most fauna and habitat variables did not differ among
   the inter-fire interval categories. However, mountain brush-tail possum
   detections increased with inter-fire interval length, with 260\% more
   observations within the older treatment when compared with the younger
   treatment. Large tree density, maximum tree height, and tree canopy
   cover were 40\%, 38\% and 12\% higher within the older than younger
   treatment, respectively. Conversely, small tree density was 78\% lower
   within the older treatment. Our results show a limited response of fauna

   forest, however also highlight that species-/habitat-specific responses

Abstract = {{Using coverboard arrays, we monitored woodland salamanders on the Fernow
   Experimental Forest in the central Appalachian Mountains, West Virginia,
   USA prior to and following two prescribed fires in mixed oak (Quercus
   spp.) forest stands. Treatments were burn plots on upper slopes or lower
   slopes fenced to prevent white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
   herbivory or control plots that were unfenced and unburned. Most of the
   7 species we observed were the mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus
   ocropheaus), red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and slimy
   salamander (Plethodon glutinosis). Significant population responses were
   difficult to interpret with numerous treatment and year interactions.
   Results largely were equivocal. We found no change in woodland
   salamander assemblage prior to burning or afterwards. There were few
   differences in adult to juvenile ratios of salamanders among treatments.
   Still, a priori contrasts of mountain dusky salamanders and red-backed
   salamander counts corrected for detection probability were greater under
   coverboards in the 2 years monitored after both prescribed fires had
   occurred than before burning or in unburned controls. This suggests that
   these species responded to the reduced leaf litter on the forest floor
   by utilizing coverboards more. Similarly, the three predominate species
   of salamanders also were more numerous under coverboards in plots
   subjected to deer herbivory with less subsequent forest floor vegetation
   as compared to those burned plots that were fenced. Our observations
   would suggest that woodland salamanders somewhat are tolerant of two
   prescribed fires within close temporal proximity. However, because
   woodland salamanders can be significantly reduced following timber
   harvest, continued research is needed to fully understand impacts of
   fire as a pre-harvest management tool in central Appalachian forests.

Abstract = {{Prescribed fires are a common management practice in the temperate
   forests of Australia, but effects on total forest carbon (C) of
   long-term prescribed fire regimes, involving multiple repeat fires,
   remain under-examined. This study quantified C stocks in multiple pools
   after 27 years of a long-term prescribed fire experiment in a
   mixed-species eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia. The
   experimental design included five replications of each of five
   treatments - a long-unburnt Control, plus a factorial combination of two
   fire frequencies (c. 3-yearly `High', c. 10-yearly `Low'), and two fire
   seasons (Spring, Autumn) encompassing up to 7 low-intensity repeat fires
   over the 27 years.
   Overall, total C stocks (the sum of all pools: Above-ground biomass,
   Dead wood, Litter, and Soil) were significantly greater in Control than
   Fire treatments. Mean total C stock differences (Control minus Fire)
   were 36 Mg ha(-1), and increased with both fire frequency (46 Mg ha(-1),
   Control versus High frequency treatments) and fires in autumn rather
   than spring (42 Mg ha(-1), Control versus Autumn treatments). Mean
   differences had wide 95\% confidence intervals (e.g. 4-67 Mg C ha(-1),
   Control versus Fire), indicating considerable uncertainty about the
   magnitude of effects of prescribed fire regimes on total C in these
   native forests. Weighted averaging of linear multiple regression models
   was used to identify the most important variables for explaining
   proportional C stock differences ((Control-Fire)/Control), and involved
   consideration of 85 explanatory variables including measures of fire
   intensity, fire severity, fuel, pre- and post-fire rainfall, fire
   weather, and topography. The best regression model explained 80\% of
   variation in total C stock differences between Control and Fire
   treatments. Consistently important explanatory variables were those
   representing or associated with fire intensity (flame angle, wind speed,
   Forest Fire Danger Index), and number of prescribed fires. Measures of
   fuel load, pre- and post-fire rainfall, and, in particular, fire
   severity, were less important explanatory variables. The study provides
   indications of management options for minimising C stock decreases
   associated with prescribed fire regimes in temperate eucalypt forests;
   notably, wide fire intervals (closer to 10 than 3 years), and utilising
   strategies to minimise mean fire intensity, including burning in moist

   may be pathogenic to young plants; microbial-feeding nematodes may

   nematodes represent higher trophic levels. The spatial distribution and
   abundance of nematode species in forests reflect soil type, soil
   fertility, climate, canopy and understorey plant species, litter depth,
   forest age, and management. Nematodes may be important in forest
   nurseries; they occur throughout the rooting depth of forest trees;
   hyphal-feeding species may influence mycorrhizae; and insect-vectored
   Bursaphelenchus species are a quarantine risk. Nematode populations
   interact with those of other soil animals (e.g., mites, tardigrades,
   enchytraeids, and protozoa). The diversity and abundance of the nematode
   assemblage make nematodes a useful indicator of soil condition and soil
   processes. Information available from forest systems suggests that, as
   long as physical disturbance is minimized and remaining trees or herb
   layer moderate the microclimate, logging and other forestry operations

   disturbance, such as bulldozing and slash-and-burn management, can

   management that enhances growth of understorey or herb layer can
   stimulate nematode populations. Each of these changes can be related to
   changes in food resource availability and environmental conditions, such

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Sudden and long term changes in the landscape can be attributed to
   periodic wildfires which, is a cyclic occurrence at Kudremukh national
   forest in Western Ghats of India. These land-use changes influence the
   hydrology of landscape, causing disintegration of soil, loss of
   biodiversity, changes in stream and flooding. To understand and account
   for these land-use changes, a new approach was implemented by developing
   fire susceptibility map from topographic, climatic and human-induced
   factors and validating it with MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging
   Spectro-radiometer) fire points for discretising accuracy. The fire
   susceptibility map can be used for studying the long-term (year or more)
   effects of fire on water balance systems. The fire susceptibility map
   generated for the years 2005 and 2017 was overlaid with MODIS LULC (Land
   Use Land Cover) for establishing the post-fire scenario whereas MODIS
   LULC MCD12Q1 (2005 and 2017) was considered as the no-fire scenario to
   analyse the intensity of the fire and its effect on streamflow and
   infiltration. These maps along with historical satellite hydro-climatic
   datasets, were used to assess the effect of forest fire on hydrological
   parameters using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model.
   No-fire and post-fire conditions were established by modifying SCS-CN
   (Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number) based on previous works of
   literature to represent the catchment as unburnt and burnt area. The
   SWAT model was calibrated (2002-2008) and validated (2009-2012) for
   establishing a baseline scenario. The sensitive parameters obtained from
   SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting) algorithm in SWAT-CUP
   (Calibration and Uncertainty Programs) were used to simulate stream
   flows fill 2017 due to lack of observed streamflow data for the year
   2017. It was inferred that the effect of wildfire on flows in recent
   years (2017) had increased radically when compared to the flows before a
   decade (2005), diminishing the rate of infiltration and causing the

Abstract = {{Here, we evaluate the ecosystem functioning and the ecosystems services
   supply of different vegetation types (grasslands, shrublands and
   woodlands) under contrasting management regimes by comparing a protected
   area with the surrounding landscape, which has been subjected to human
   disturbance in the Eastern Hills of Uruguay. We propose, based on
   functional attributes and vegetation physiognomy, a State and Transition
   Model for the dynamics of the grassland-woodland mosaic. We used remote
   sensing techniques to: (i) develop a land-cover map of the study area
   based on supervised Landsat imagery classification, and (ii) compare
   attributes of the ecosystem functioning (productivity and seasonality)
   and service supply derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI) images provided by the moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The land-cover map showed that
   grasslands and shrublands were the most extensive land covers in the
   study area. These vegetation types presented higher productivity,
   seasonality and ecosystem service supply, outside the protected area
   than inside it. On the other hand, woodlands showed higher productivity,
   ecosystem service supply and lower seasonality inside the protected area
   than outside of it. Two axes represented the grassland-woodland mosaic
   dynamic: (i) the mean annual and (ii) the intra-annual coefficient of
   variation of the NDVI. Our results highlight that conservation of
   grasslands, shrublands and woodlands require different management
   strategies based on particular disturbance regimes like moderate grazing
   and controlled burns. Moderate disturbances may help to preserve
   ecosystem services provisioning in grasslands and shrublands. On the
   contrary, woodland conservation requires a more rigorous regime of
   protection against disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the water balance of a forested ombrotrophic peatland and
   adjacent burned peatland in the boreal plain of western Canada over a
   3-year period. Complete combustion of foliage and fine branches
   dramatically increased shortwave radiation inputs to the peat surface
   while halting all tree transpiration at the burned site. End-of-winter
   snowpack was 7-25\% higher at the burned site likely due to decreased
   ablation from the tree canopy at the unburned site. Shrub regrowth at
   the burned site was rapid post-fire, and shading by the shrub canopy in
   the burned site approached that of the unburned site within 3years after
   fire. Site-averaged surface resistance to evaporation was not different
   between sites, though surface resistance in hollows was lower in the
   burned site. Water loss at both burned and unburned sites is largely
   driven by surface evaporative losses. Evaporation at the burned site
   marginally exceeded the sum of pre-fire transpiration and interception
   at the unburned site, suggesting that evapotranspiration during the
   growing season was 20-40mm greater at the burned peatland. Although the
   net change in water storage during the growing season was largely
   unchanged by fire, the lack of low-density surface peat in the burned
   site appears to have decreased specific yield, leading to greater water
   table decline at the burned site despite similar net change in storage.

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Biomass burning produces black carbon (BC), effectively transferring a
   fraction of the biomass C from an actively cycling pool to a passive C
   pool, which may be stored in the soil. Yet the timescales and mechanisms
   for incorporation of BC into the soil profile are not well understood.
   The High Park fire (HPF), which occurred in northwestern Colorado in the
   summer of 2012, provided an opportunity to study the effects of both
   fire severity and geomorphology on properties of carbon (C), nitrogen
   (N) and BC in the Cache La Poudre River drainage. We sampled montane
   ponderosa pine forest floor (litter plus O-horizon) and soils at 0-5 and
   5-15 cm depth 4 months post-fire in order to examine the effects of
   slope and burn severity on \% C, C stocks, \% N and BC. We used the
   benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method for quantifying BC. With
   regard to slope, we found that steeper slopes had higher C: N than
   shallow slopes but that there was no difference in BPCA-C content or
   stocks. BC content was greatest in the forest floor at burned sites (19
   g BPCA-C kg(-1) C), while BC stocks were greatest in the 5-15 cm
   subsurface soils (23 g BPCA-C m(-2)). At the time of sampling, unburned
   and burned soils had equivalent BC content, indicating none of the BC
   deposited on the land surface post-fire had been incorporated into
   either the 0-5 or 5-15 cm soil layers. The ratio of B6CA : total BPCAs,
   an index of the degree of aromatic C condensation, suggested that BC in
   the 5-15 cm soil layer may have been formed at higher temperatures or
   experienced selective degradation relative to the forest floor and 0-5
   cm soils. Total BC soil stocks were relatively low compared to other
   fire-prone grassland and boreal forest systems, indicating most of the
   BC produced in this system is likely lost, either through erosion
   events, degradation or translocation to deeper soils. Future work
   examining mechanisms for BC losses from forest soils will be required
   for understanding the role BC plays in the global carbon cycle.}},

Title = {{Restoration of quaking aspen woodlands invaded by western juniper}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{59}},

Pages = {{88-97}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis spp. occidentalis Hook.)
   woodlands are rapidly replacing lower elevation (< 2100 m) quaking aspen
   (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands throughout the northern Great Basin.
   Aspen restoration is important because these communities provide
   critical habitat for many wildlife species and contain a high diversity
   of understory shrubs and herbaceous species. We studied two juniper
   removal treatments to restore aspen woodlands. Treatments included
   cutting one-third of the juniper trees followed by early fall burning
   (FALL) or early spring burning (SPRING). Selective cutting of juniper
   was performed to increase cured surface (0-2 m) fuel levels to carry
   fire through the woodlands. We tested treatment effectiveness at
   removing juniper from seedlings to mature trees, measured aspen sucker
   recruitment, and evaluated the response to treatment of shrub and
   herbaceous cover and diversity. In the FALL treatment, burning
   eliminated all remaining juniper trees and seedlings, stimulated a
   6-fold increase in aspen suckering (10 000 ha(-1)), but initially
   resulted in a significant reduction in herbaceous cover. Spring burning
   removed 80\% of the mature juniper trees that remained after cutting.
   However, 50\% of juniper juveniles survived the SPRING treatment, which
   will permit juniper to redominate these stands in less than 80 years.
   Aspen suckering in the SPRING increased only 2.5-fold to 5 300 stems
   ha(-1) by the third year after fire. In the SPRING, herbaceous cover
   increased 330\% and the number of species observed doubled by the third
   year after fire. If the management objective is to eliminate western
   juniper with minimal cutting and stimulate greater aspen suckering, we
   recommend that woodlands be burned in the fall. If the objective is to
   maintain shrub and herbaceous cover and moderately increase aspen
   suckering, spring burning is recommended. With spring burning it appears
   follow-up management will be necessary to remove juniper that are missed
   in initial treatments.}},

Title = {{Using Landsat Spectral Indices in Time-Series to Assess Wildfire
   Disturbance and Recovery}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Satellite earth observation is being increasingly used to monitor
   forests across the world. Freely available Landsat data stretching back
   four decades, coupled with advances in computer processing capabilities,
   has enabled new time-series techniques for analyzing forest change.
   Typically, these methods track individual pixel values over time,
   through the use of various spectral indices. This study examines the
   utility of eight spectral indices for characterizing fire disturbance
   and recovery in sclerophyll forests, in order to determine their
   relative merits in the context of Landsat time-series. Although existing
   research into Landsat indices is comprehensive, this study presents a
   new approach, by comparing the distributions of pre and post-fire pixels
   using Glass's delta, for evaluating indices without the need of detailed
   field information. Our results show that in the sclerophyll forests of
   southeast Australia, common indices, such as the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), both
   accurately capture wildfire disturbance in a pixel-based time-series
   approach, especially if images from soon after the disturbance are
   available. However, for tracking forest regrowth and recovery, indices,
   such as NDVI, which typically capture chlorophyll concentration or
   canopy `greenness', are not as reliable, with values returning to
   pre-fire levels in 3-5 years. In comparison, indices that are more
   sensitive to forest moisture and structure, such as NBR, indicate much
   longer (8-10 years) recovery timeframes. This finding is consistent with
   studies that were conducted in other forest types. We also demonstrate
   that additional information regarding forest condition, particularly in
   relation to recovery, can be extracted from less well known indices,
   such as NBR2, as well as textural indices incorporating spatial
   variance. With Landsat time-series gaining in popularity in recent
   years, it is critical to understand the advantages and limitations of
   the various indices that these methods rely on.}},

   grasslands and savannas. Methods: An artificial jaragua grassland and an
   artificial jaragua savanna were studied at the California and Flores
   Magon communities, respectively, in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve. Were
   measured pre and post-fire fuel loads. Six prescribed bums (three
   heading and three backing fires) were conducted in each, grassland and
   savanna, and were measured meteorological as well as fire behavior
   variables. Emissions were estimated multiplying the consumed fuel load
   by an emission constant. Results: In the grassland, were obtained the
   following averages: fuel load, 6.214 t/ha; residual load, 0.107 t/ha,
   and CO2 emission, 10.449 t CO2/ha. For the savanna, were recorded
   14.119. 2.161 and 20.460 t CO2/ha, respectively, without differences for
   the pre and post-fire fuel loads between heading and backing fires. For
   the grassland, the heading fires reached 3.92 m, 1.83 m and 22.3 m/min
   for flame length, flame depth and fire propagation rate, while for
   hacking fires such values were, respectively: 1.07, 0.23 and 0.67 m/min,
   with significant differences. For the savanna, heading fires yielded
   5.89 m (flame length), 1.53 m (flame depth) and 45.5 m/min (propagation
   rate), while for backing fires that values were 2.21, 0.76 and 2.8
   in/min. also with significant differences. Conclusions: Under the
   studied environmental conditions, particularly in the savanna, fire
   behavior is dangerous so a good prescription and more care must be taken
   for conducting controlled or prescribed burns. For forest fires, direct
   firefighting by the head of the fire must be avoided. for is too

Abstract = {{We examined numbers of plant species and individuals relative to land
   use in an agricultural settlement in the Brazilian Amazon. Land uses
   were forest, cropped after forest, fallows, cropped after fallow, and
   pasture. These corresponded roughly to farmers' land-use changes over
   time. Numbers of species and diversity indices were generally highest in
   forest, but we found quite similar values in older fallows as a result
   of both survival/re-establishment of forest species and emergence of
   plants not encountered in forest. The dominant species in fallows,
   however, were different from those in forest. Lands cropped using
   slash-and-burn maintained moderate numbers of species-both forest and
   non-forest. Trends in plant density (individuals per unit ground area)
   on cropped lands were mainly related to invasion of weedy species
   (increasing in time after slash-and-burn) and shifts in crop species
   (replacement of small-sized rice by larger-sized maize and cassava).
   Useful forest plants (e.g. for construction purposes, food and
   medicines) decreased with land conversion, although new species also
   appeared. The fewest species, tree species, and useful plants, and the
   greatest losses of the forest flora, were encountered in pastures.
   Consequently, conversion to pasture rather than slash-and-burn
   agriculture per se led to high biodiversity loss.}},

Abstract = {{In tropical grasslands and savannas, fire is used to reduce woody
   vegetation expansion. Woody vegetation in these biomes is often patchily
   distributed, and micro-climatic conditions can largely vary locally with
   unknown consequences for fire effects. We hypothesised that (1) fire has
   higher temperature and maintains high temperatures for a longer period
   at the windward side than at the leeward side of wooded patches, (2)
   this difference increases with patch size, (3) fire has a larger effect
   on woody vegetation at the windward side than at the leeward side of
   wooded patches and (4) this effect increases with patch size. We planted
   tree seedlings around wooded patches in a grassland and burnt these
   plots. We found that fire had a lower temperature and had an elevated
   temperature for a shorter time period at the leeward side of wooded
   patches than at the windward side. Also, we found smaller effect of fire
   on the seedlings at the leeward side. We conclude that patches of woody
   vegetation can have a large effect on the role of fire in tropical

Abstract = {{The effects that changes in forest structure and composition have on
   wildlife have often been considered independently, such that the
   potential for interactive effects has received relatively little
   attention. We investigated the importance of vegetation structure,
   floristic composition, and their interaction for predicting bird
   distribution in mixed broadleaf-conifer forest. We collected vegetation
   and bird data at 979 stations in a watershed in southern Oregon in the
   spring of 2001. At each station, we described the vegetation using
   measures of structure (total vegetation volume) and of floristic
   composition (broadleaf-conifer composition). We then used logistic
   regression to model the probability of occurrence of bird species as a
   function of these 2 variables, their quadratic terms, and their
   interaction. Using stepwise model selection we identified the best model
   for each species and used area under the curve (AUC) scores to evaluate
   model performance. Of the 44 bird species we investigated, 20 had models
   with AUC scores >= 0.70. Of the best models for these 20 species, 1
   included vegetation composition alone, 12 included just the main effects
   of vegetation composition and structure, and 7 included both the main
   effects and interaction terms. In summer of 2001 a wildfire burned 2,500
   ha of the study area, resulting in substantial changes in the vegetation
   structure and composition. We used 4 yr of postfire bird and vegetation
   surveys to test the predictive performance of the habitat models for 9
   species that occurred at >15\% of the burned stations. Models for 3 of
   these species performed poorly (AUC < 0.7) in all 4 yr. For the other 6
   species, predictive performance was low in the first year after fire and
   improved during subsequent years, suggesting a lagged response to
   changes in vegetation structure and composition. Quantifying the
   interactive effects of vegetation structure and composition improves our
   understanding of how birds respond to forest management and large-scale

Abstract = {{Fire is an important disturbance agent in Chinese boreal forests but the
   long-term effects of wildfires on soil nitrogen (N) net mineralisation
   rates (R-min) in natural versus human-assisted restorations are not well
   understood. In this study, we analysed upper (0-10 cm) and lower layer
   (10-20 cm) soil samples from natural restoration and afforestation plots
   in a Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii) forest in north-eastern China 29
   years after a mega fire disturbance. Our results showed that the soil
   inorganic N (NH4+-N and NO3--N) pool of the upper and lower layers of
   the regenerated plots remained significantly lower than in unburned
   control plots. This suggests that the effects of a high bum severity
   fire on soil N availability were still significant almost 30 years after
   the event. Restoration type (natural restoration versus afforestation)
   also had significant effects on upper layer soil N availability;
   compared with afforestation, natural restoration was more beneficial for
   the accumulation of soil inorganic N and the recovery of R-min after
   fire disturbance. Specifically, the concentration of inorganic N and the
   mean R-min in upper layer soils in the natural restoration plots were
   approximately 41\% greater and 3.6 times greater, respectively, than in
   the afforestation plots. The differences in soil N availability between
   the two restoration types were attributed to differences in soil water
   content (SWC), soil microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and the recovery
   of vegetation after the fire disturbance. Our study demonstrates that
   natural restoration has proved more successful than afforestation in
   countering soil N losses in boreal forests in China resulting from a
   high burn severity fire disturbance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Numerous wildlife species are dependent on the creation and maintenance
   of early successional forests, yet little is known about the effects of
   habitat management on some threatened species. One such species is the
   eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferous), a nocturnal bird of
   conservation concern. We examined the effects of heavy thinning, mowing,
   burning, and herbicide treatments on this species by conducting point
   counts and nest searches on a pitch pine-scrub oak (Pinus rigida-Quercus
   ilicifolia) barren in western Massachusetts, USA, between 2006 and 2013.
   Our point-count data showed that the abundance of calling birds was
   greater in managed shrublands such as scrub oak barrens and heavily
   thinned pitch pine stands, compared to closed-canopy pitch pine and
   deciduous forest. We found a high number of whip-poor-will nests (n=26)
   and roosts (n=59), which we located primarily within managed shrublands.
   We did not search for nests in closed-canopy forests, and we were unable
   to determine the extent of their use of the forest edge for nesting.
   Nevertheless, birds selected nest sites under residual deciduous trees
   within the early successional forests; therefore, canopy cover appears
   to be important for nest placement at the nest-patch spatial scale, but
   not necessarily at a broader scale. Nests were found in both dense and
   sparse understory vegetation; none were found in vegetation patches that
   were <2 years since treatment. Estimated nest survival was 63\% through
   incubation (daily survival rate=0.977, n=21), consistent with other
   published studies of nightjars in the United States and Canada. Creating
   and maintaining open-canopy early successional forests in pitch
   pine-scrub oak barrens, with the retention of some residual deciduous

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Fire severity can vary greatly within and among burns, even in the
   Canadian boreal forest where fire regimes consist mostly of
   stand-replacing fires. We investigated the effects of fire severity on
   the long-term occupancy of burns by (i) saproxylic insects and (ii)
   three wood-foraging birds. Based on observations made 6 to 11 years
   after fire in burned conifer forests that varied in fire severity in
   Quebec, Canada, our results indicate that low-severity portions of the
   burns likely provided snag conditions suitable for the long-term
   presence of deadwood-associated insects and birds. The black-backed
   woodpecker, a post-fire forest specialist, was still abundant 6 and 8
   years after fire. This pattern was likely explained by the persistence
   of several saproxylic insect species that are associated with recently
   dead trees and by the positive effect of lower fire severity on the
   abundance of Arhopalus foveicollis, a cerambycid with a long life cycle
   in dead wood. The American three-toed woodpecker and the brown creeper,
   and their associated prey (Scolytinae beetles), were more abundant in
   burned stands of lower v. higher severity. We conclude that less
   severely burned snags and stands within high-severity burns may favour
   the long-term presence of trophic webs that involve saproxylic insects
   and wood-foraging birds in burned boreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{Chipmunks (Tamias spp.) in western North America are important for their
   numerical abundance, their role in pathogen transmission, and the
   composition and structure of food webs. As such, land management
   agencies (e.g., U.S. Forest Service) often conduct field surveys to
   monitor the diversity and abundance of chipmunk species as a measure of
   forest health. These small mammal communities often include several
   morphologically similar chipmunk species, some of which occasionally
   hybridize, which can make field identification of species difficult.
   However, species-specific differences in both spatial distribution and
   habitat use make it imperative that biotic inventories correctly
   identify chipmunk species. We compared molecular-based and field-based,
   external phenotypic identifications of 4 chipmunk species in the Lake
   Tahoe Basin of the Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada, USA. Across
   all years and sites, we found an error rate of 14\% for field-based
   identifications with significantly lower rates of misidentification in
   relatively undisturbed wildlands in comparison to recently burned
   wildlands or urbanized sites. We also found evidence for sporadic
   hybridization between focal species, including cases of mito-nuclear
   mismatch. Our study highlights the utility of molecular tools in
   corroborating field identifications of chipmunks in changing landscapes.

Abstract = {{Wood-pastures are among the oldest land-use types in Europe and have
   high ecological and cultural importance. They are under rapid decline
   all over Europe because of changes in land use, tree cutting, and lack
   of regeneration. In this study we characterized the structure, condition
   and threats of wood-pastures in a traditional rural region in Romania.
   Forty-two wood-pastures were surveyed, as well as 15 forest sites for
   comparison. All wood-pasture sites were described via four groups of
   variables: condition, management, site, and landscape context. Forest
   sites were dominated by Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and Beech (Fagus
   sylvatica), whereas wood-pastures were dominated by Oak (Quercus sp.)
   and various species of fruit trees. Most wood-pastures contained trees
   classified as `ancient' but no such trees were found in forests. The
   proportion of dead trees was positively related to forest cover within
   300 m around the wood-pasture. Models that included management, site and
   landscape-related variables best explained the prelevance of Oak, Beech,
   Hornbeam and Pear trees in wood-pastures. Large oaks and horn-beams were
   more likely to be dead or affected by uncontrolled pasture burning than
   small oaks and other tree species. Our results show that ancient
   wood-pastures are common in this rural region, and they may be more
   common in Eastern Europe than previously thought. There is an urgent
   need for research, legal recognition and conservation management of
   wood-pastures as distinct landscape elements for their cultural,
   ecological and agricultural importance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Changes in the cover and density of shrubs and trees were assessed from
   aerial photographs (1940, 1974 and 1998) as well as from fixed-point
   photographs taken in 1984 and 1996 in the Kruger National Park, South
   Africa. Woody cover (trees and shrubs combined) increased by 12\% on
   granite substrates but decreased by 64\% on basalt substrates over the
   past 58 years. Both these figures are expressed in terms of the initial
   values, respectively. The density of the large tree component of woody
   vegetation decreased on both substrates. Woody vegetation cover declined
   as fire return periods became shorter, but the relationship was weak.
   The increases in woody plant density and cover on granite are thought to
   be the result of decreased competition from grasses, which in turn is a
   result of overgrazing by wild herbivores whose numbers have been kept
   high through the provision of surface water. These effects were not seen
   on the relatively nutrient-rich basalts, where grasses can recover
   rapidly even after heavy grazing. The decline in overall woody cover on
   basalts is interpreted as a result of regular, short-interval prescribed
   burning over the past 40 years, while the universal decline in large
   trees seems to result from an interaction between regular, frequent
   fires and utilization by elephants. The implications for management are

Abstract = {{1. Recovery of rainforest bird community structure and composition, in

   or jhum was studied in Mizoram, north-east India. Replicate fallow sites
   abandoned after shifting cultivation 1, 5, 10, 25 and approximate to 100
   years ago, were compared with primary evergreen and semi-evergreen
   forest using transect and quadrat sampling.
   2, Vegetation variables such as woody plant species richness, tree
   density and vertical stratification increased with fallow age in a
   rapid. nun-linear, asymptotic manner. Principal components analysis of
   vegetation variables summarized 92.8\% of the variation into two axes:
   PC1 reflecting forest development and woody plant succession (variables
   such as tree density, woody plant species richness), and PC2 depicting
   bamboo density, which increased from 1 to 25 years and declined
   thereafter.
   3, Bird species richness, abundance and diversity, increased rapidly and
   asymptotically during succession paralleling vegetation recovery as
   shown by positive correlations with fallow age and PC1 scores of sites.
   Bamboo density reflected by PC2 had a negative effect on bird species
   richness and abundance.
   4, The bird community similarity (Morisita index) of sites with primary
   forest also increased asymptotically with fallow age indicating
   sequential species turnover during succession. Bird community similarity
   of sites with primary forest (or between sites) was positively
   correlated with both physiognomic and floristic similarities with
   primary forest (or between sites).
   5. The number of bird species in guilds associated with forest
   development and woody plants (canopy insectivores, frugivores: bark
   feeders) was correlated with PCI scores of the sites. Species in other
   guilds (e. g. granivores, understorey insectivores) appeared to dominate
   during early and mid-succession.
   6, The non-linear relationships imply that fallow periods less than a
   threshold of 25 years for birds, and about 50-75 years for woody plants,
   are likely to cause substantial community alteration.

Abstract = {{Background Shifting cultivation (locally known as ``jhum{''}) is a major
   driver of deforestation and loss of ecosystem services in rainforests.
   For developing any effective conservation of biodiversity and carbon
   service program, an in-depth understanding to the recovery of vegetation
   and carbon after abandonment of jhum is essential. We estimated species
   richness, abundance and composition of trees, shrubs and herbs, carbon
   distribution in aboveground and belowground components along a
   chronosequence of jhum fallow in northeast India, and elucidated the
   factors affecting the recovery processes of jhum fallows. Methods
   Species composition and other plant community attributes, carbon storage
   in different pools were studied in 5 jhum fallows (< 5, 5-10, 11-15,
   16-20, 21-25 years old) and an old-growth forest. The data were
   subjected to linear mixed effect modeling using R-package ``nlme{''} for
   identifying the important factors contributing to the recovery of
   vegetation and carbon. Results Species composition varied significantly
   (P < 0.05) between jhum fallows and old-growth forest. Tree density
   varied from 28 stems ha(-1) in 5 years old jhum fallow to 163 stems
   ha(-1) in old-growth forest. Both biomass carbon in all components and
   soil organic carbon were significantly (P = 0.01) lower in jhum fallows
   than in the old-growth forest except living non-woody biomass component.
   The recovery of aboveground biomass carbon was faster during early
   successive years than the mid-successive jhum fallows. Total ecosystem
   carbon and soil organic carbon stock in the oldest jhum fallow was 33\%
   and 62\% of those in the old-growth forest, respectively. The fallow age
   was found to be the most important explanatory factor in the recovery
   process of vegetation and carbon stock in re-growing fallows. Conclusion
   The shifting cultivation fallows gradually recovered both vegetation and
   carbon and are potential repository sites for biodiversity conservation,
   which may take much longer time to reach up to old-growth forest in
   northeast India.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem-based forest management is based on the principle of emulating
   regional natural disturbance regimes with forest management. An
   interesting area for a case study of the potential of ecosystem-based
   forest management is the boreal forest of north-western Qu,bec and
   north-eastern Ontario, where the disturbance regime creates a mosaic of
   stands with both complex and simple structures. Old-growth stands of
   this region have multi-storied, open structures, thick soil organic
   layers, and are unproductive, while young post-fire stands established
   following severe fires that consumed most of the organic soil show dense
   and even-sized/aged structures and are more productive. Current forest
   management emulates the effects of low severity fires, which only
   partially consume the organic layers, and could lead to unproductive
   even-aged stands. The natural disturbance and forest management regimes
   differ in such a way that both young productive and old-growth forests
   could ultimately be under-represented on the landscape under a fully
   regulated forest management regime. Two major challenges for
   ecosystem-based forest management of this region are thus to: (1)
   maintain complex structures associated with old-growth forests, and (2)
   promote the establishment of productive post-harvest stands, while at
   the same time maintaining harvested volume. We discuss different
   silvicultural approaches that offer solutions to these challenges,
   namely the use of (1) partial harvesting to create or maintain complex
   structures typical of old-growth stands, and (2) site preparation
   techniques to emulate severe soil burns and create productive
   post-harvest stands. A similar approach could be applied to any region
   where the natural disturbance regime creates a landscape where both
   even-aged stands established after stand-replacing disturbances and
   irregular old-growth stands created by smaller scale disturbances are
   significant.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the underlying mechanisms that control long-term recovery
   of tundra carbon (C) and nutrients after fire, we employed the Multiple
   Element Limitation (MEL) model to simulate 200-yr post-fire changes in
   the biogeochemistry of three sites along a burn severity gradient in
   response to increases in air temperature, CO2 concentration, nitrogen
   (N) deposition, and phosphorus (P) weathering rates. The simulations
   were conducted for-severely burned, moderately burned, and unburned
   arctic tundra. Our simulations indicated that recovery of C balance
   after fire was mainly determined by the internal redistribution of
   nutrients among ecosystem components (controlled by air temperature),
   rather than the supply of nutrients from external sources (e. g.,
   nitrogen deposition and fixation, phosphorus weathering). Increases in
   air temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration resulted in (1) a net
   transfer of nutrient from soil organic matter to vegetation and (2)
   higher C : nutrient ratios in vegetation and soil organic matter. These
   changes led to gains in vegetation biomass C but net losses in soil
   organic C stocks. Under a warming climate, nutrients lost in wildfire
   were difficult to recover because the warming-induced acceleration in
   nutrient cycles caused further net nutrient loss from the system through
   leaching. In both burned and unburned tundra, the warming-caused
   acceleration in nutrient cycles and increases in ecosystem C stocks were
   eventually constrained by increases in soil C : nutrient ratios, which
   increased microbial retention of plant-available nutrients in the soil.
   Accelerated nutrient turnover, loss of C, and increasing soil
   temperatures will likely result in vegetation changes, which further
   regulate the long-term biogeochemical succession. Our analysis should
   help in the assessment of tundra C budgets and of the recovery of
   biogeochemical function following fire, which is in turn necessary for
   the maintenance of wildlife habitat and tundra vegetation.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In eastern North America, oak (Quercus) regeneration failure has spurred
   management using silvicultural approaches better aligned with the
   autecology of oaks. In particular, shelterwood harvests can create
   favorable intermediate light conditions for oak establishment and
   prescribed fire is predicted (by the oak-fire hypothesis) to favor oak
   regeneration. These approaches substantially modify forest structure and
   may affect crucial trophic interactions including the conditional
   mutualism between oaks and granivorous rodents that scatterhoard acorns,
   which shifts along a continuum from antagonistic to mutualistic
   depending on external factors. We investigated how overwinter survival
   and dispersal of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns were influenced
   by location within or outside of group shelterwood harvests (small
   canopy gaps created throughout an intact forest stand) with and without
   prescribed fire. We conducted two concurrent experiments to test (1)
   dispersal and survival of acorns presented on the forest floor and (2)
   acorn pilferage rates from caches that mimic squirrel scatterhoards in
   shelterwood gap/group interiors, edges, and the uncut forest matrix in
   burned and unburned forest stands. In both experiments, acorn survival
   was generally higher in burned than unburned stands. Acorn survival from
   forest floor presentations was higher in the unharvested forest matrix
   than harvest gap interiors; however, there was no effect of proximity to
   harvest gaps on survival of cached acorns. Survival of cached acorns was
   associated with understory vegetative cover (-), coarse woody debris
   cover (-), and distance to nearest tree (+), but uncorrelated with
   canopy cover above the cache. Our results suggest that reduced
   understory cover following prescribed fire may increase perceived
   habitat riskiness for granivores resulting in higher acorn survival up
   to 2 yr post-fire. These findings unify the oak-fire and oak-granivore
   conditional mutualism hypotheses, and suggest that the environmental
   conditions following prescribed fire and group shelterwood harvests may
   shift the oak-granivore conditional mutualism in a direction beneficial
   for oak regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Fire frequency has been highlighted as an important component of fire
   effects on ecosystems; nevertheless, there is scarce information about
   how fire modulates changes in ecosystem properties, particularly for
   subtropical dry forests. A long-term natural experiment and a multiscale
   approach were used to analyze changes in ecosystem properties in a
   subtropical dry forest subjected to contrasting fire regimes.
   Measurements were taken in two adjacent sites that had contrasting fire
   regimes (low/high fire frequency), and vegetation and soil analyses were
   combined with dendrochronological methods. Ten plots (20 x 20 m) were
   established in each site and soil (depth, chemical, and biological
   properties), and vegetation (species composition and growth of the
   dominant tree, Lithraea molleoides) variables were measured. Fire scars
   in L. molleoides were useful in determining fire history. Shrubs and
   grasses were more abundant in the high fire frequency site, with a high
   cover of the exotic grass Melinis repens, whereas trees and vines were
   more abundant in the low fire frequency site. Soil of the high fire
   frequency site tended to have lower C and nutrient content as well a
   significant lower depth than those of the low fire frequency site.
   Growth of L. molleoides individuals was lower in the high fire frequency
   site. Our results suggest that the long-term effects of high fire
   frequency probably increase both soil loss and fire frequency in the

   top-kill from prescribed fire}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Background Regulation of the dominance of resprouting understory
   hardwoods is a common objective for prescribed fire in open-canopy
   longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) woodland of the southeastern USA.
   Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of individual pines on
   fire and hardwood mortality. We studied growing-season fires in
   stem-mapped stands in southwest Georgia, USA; the stands displayed large
   variation in structure due to cutting treatments applied seven years
   earlier. We measured air temperature and heating duration, and measured
   post-fire sprouting behavior of four guilds of understory hardwoods:
   mesic oaks (Quercus spp. L.), upland oaks, xeric oaks, and
   fleshy-fruited hardwoods. Mean air temperature (i.e., of flames, buoyant
   plume, and smoldering combustion) and heating duration (time over 60
   degrees C) were analyzed with respect to fuel-bed conditions and
   neighboring tree density. Hardwood top-kill was analyzed with respect to
   neighboring tree density and hardwood height. Results The basal area of
   nearby pines strongly affected heating duration (time over 60 degrees
   C), which increased linearly from a mean of 87 s to a mean of 234 s
   across a gradient of pine basal area from 0 to 30 m(2) ha(-1). Mean air
   temperature during prescribed fire was unaffected by pine density but
   increased linearly from a mean of 114 degrees C to a mean of 148 degrees
   C across a gradient of wiregrass (Aristida stricta Michx.) cover from 0
   to 100\%, respectively. Neighborhood models showed that time over 60
   degrees C during the burns was longest at the base of pines and
   decreased by two thirds at 3.3 m distance. Pines affected hardwood
   top-kill probability at a similar scale, the effect at 4.4 m decreasing
   by two thirds compared to at the base of the pine. The four hardwood
   guilds were readily top-killed when <= 1 m tall, but at 2 m height,
   upland and xeric oaks had become more resistant to top-kill than mesic
   oaks or fleshy-fruited hardwoods. Conclusions The influence of
   individual pine trees on heating duration and top-kill power of
   prescribed fire drops by two thirds of maximum within 3 to 4 m of a
   tree, compared to a maximum at the base of the tree. Neighborhood models
   provide a method to estimate tree effects on prescribed fire heating
   duration and top-kill probability, and thus a way of predicting stand
   structures that provide ecological benefits of openings while remaining
   below thresholds that trigger vigorous hardwood response.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a Bayesian Algorithm to Detect Burned Areas in the Canary

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Burned Area (BA) is deemed as a primary variable to understand the
   Earth's climate system. Satellite remote sensing data have allowed for
   the development of various burned area detection algorithms that have
   been globally applied to and assessed in diverse ecosystems, ranging
   from tropical to boreal. In this paper, we present a Bayesian algorithm
   (BY-MODIS) that detects burned areas in a time series of Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2002 to 2012 of
   the Canary Islands' dry woodlands and forests ecoregion (Spain). Based
   on daily image products MODIS, MOD09GQ (250 m), and MOD11A1 (1 km), the
   surface spectral reflectance and the land surface temperature,
   respectively, 10 day composites were built using the maximum temperature
   criterion. Variables used in BY-MODIS were the Global Environment
   Monitoring Index (GEMI) and Burn Boreal Forest Index (BBFI), alongside
   the NIR spectral band, all of which refer to the previous year and the
   year the fire took place in. Reference polygons for the 14 fires
   exceeding 100 hectares and identified within the period under analysis
   were developed using both post-fire LANDSAT images and official
   information from the forest fires national database by the Ministry of
   Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment of Spain (MAPAMA). The
   results obtained by BY-MODIS can be compared to those by official burned
   area products, MCD45A1 and MCD64A1. Despite that the best overall
   results correspond to MCD64A1, BY-MODIS proved to be an alternative for
   burned area mapping in the Canary Islands, a region with a great
   topographic complexity and diverse types of ecosystems. The total burned
   area detected by the BY-MODIS classifier was 64.9\% of the MAPAMA
   reference data, and 78.6\% according to data obtained from the LANDSAT
   images, with the lowest average commission error (11\%) out of the three
   products and a correlation (R-2) of 0.82. The Bayesian
   algorithmoriginally developed to detect burned areas in North American
   boreal forests using AVHRR archival data Long-Term Data Recordcan be
   successfully applied to a lower latitude forest ecosystem totally
   different from the boreal ecosystem and using daily time series of
   satellite images from MODIS with a 250 m spatial resolution, as long as
   a set of training areas adequately characterising the dynamics of the
   forest canopy affected by the fire is defined.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important management tool for both hazard reduction burning
   and maintenance of biodiversity. The impact of time since last fire on
   fauna is an important factor to understand as land managers often aim
   for prescribed burning regimes with specific fire-free intervals.
   However, our current understanding of the impact of time since last fire
   on fauna is largely unknown and likely dependent on vegetation type. We
   examined the responses of reptiles to fire age in banksia woodlands, and
   the interspersed melaleuca damplands among them, north of Perth, Western
   Australia, where the current prescribed burning regime is targeting a
   fire-free period of 8-12 years. The response of reptiles to fire was
   dependent on vegetation type. Reptiles were generally more abundant
   (e.g. Lerista elegans and Ctenophorus adelaidensis) and specious in
   banksia sites. Several species (e.g. Menetia greyii, Cryptoblepharus
   buchananii) preferred long unburnt melaleuca sites (>16 years since last
   fire, YSLF) compared to recently burnt sites (<12 YSLF). Several of the
   small elapids (e.g. the WA priority listed species Neelaps calonotus)
   were only detected in older-aged banksia sites (>16 YSLF). The
   terrestrial dragon C. adelaidensis and the skink Morethia obscura
   displayed a strong response to fire in banksia woodlands only. Highest
   abundances of the dragon were detected in the recently burnt (<7 YSLF)
   and long unburnt (>35 YSLF) banksia woodlands, while the skink was more
   abundant in older sites. Habitats from a range of fire ages are required
   to support the reptiles we detected, especially the longer unburnt (>16
   YSLF) melaleuca habitat. Current burning prescriptions are reducing the
   availability of these older habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei Buchholz)is important in woodlands that
   harbor a diverse biota. Old-growth woodlands in which Ashe juniper is
   codominant have decreased in area within the Central Texas Hill Country
   since European settlement. Juniper is often viewed as undesirable
   because it readily colonizes open spaces and is not highly palatable to
   domestic livestock. Land stewardship difficulties arise when managers
   attempt to reduce juniper abundance on a variety of sites where it is a
   component of stable communities. At least four different ecological site
   types support communities with Ashe juniper as an important component:
   (1) uplands with deep, continuous soils that support mainly evergreen
   savannas and woodlands; (2) uplands with shallow or discontinuous soils
   that support mixed evergreen/deciduous shrublands and woodlands; (3)
   uplands with reddish, chert-rich soils that support mainly deciduous or
   mixed woodlands and savannas; and (4) canyon systems and escarpments
   that support evergreen or mixed forests and woodlands. Development of
   ecologically sound, cost-effective conservation strategies for parks,
   nature reserves, or working ranches requires (1) recognition of
   different ecological site types and changes in site potentials caused by
   historical disturbances such as repeated clearing, domestic livestock,
   and erosion; (2) an understanding of the composition of stable community
   types on different site types, including acceptance of Ashe juniper as a
   natural and desirable component of the vegetation; and (3) an awareness
   of the dynamics of different community types. Fire and drought were two
   large-scale processes that regulated pre-European vegetation dynamics.
   Drought often operated on a decades-long return interval. Frequent
   ground fires burned in open savannas where fine fuel accumulated,
   whereas some sites experienced crown fires at decades-long return
   intervals. Fire was nearly absent from the most mesic forests. Managers
   must try to accurately identify ecological site types and the
   potentially stable vegetation they support, and then devise strategies
   to mimic landscape-scale, decades-long disturbance patterns within
   compact conservation areas.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of removing woody vegetation to enhance water supply in
   semiarid rangelands in the United States continues to generate
   considerable interest, even though past research has yielded apparently
   contradictory results concerning its efficacy. In an attempt to
   elucidate the factors that determine whether and how woody vegetation
   removal affects water supply, we analysed the problem using a water
   balance approach. In our analysis, deep drainage is the water balance
   component associated with water supply. Because the herbaceous
   vegetation that replaces the woody plants generally has a shallower
   effective rooting depth (R-d), the amount of soil water potentially
   available for transpiration is reduced and more,is available for deep
   drainage. The potential increase in deep drainage can be estimated from
   the capacity of the soil to store plant-available water (S-c) and may be
   substantial. Our case study on sagebrush rangeland documents how R-d,
   and consequently S-c, changed after woody vegetation at the site was
   removed by burning. Using depth profiles of soil water content and
   matric potential, we showed that the R-d of the post-fire vegetation was
   about 140 cm, 60 cm less than that of the pre-fire vegetation, and that
   this resulted in a potential increase in deep drainage of about 6 cm of
   water-which in semiarid rangelands is substantial. Historical
   precipitation patterns indicate that there is nearly always sufficient
   net precipitation to generate the additional 6 cm of deep drainage at
   this site. However, in most of the area the soil depth is less than 140
   cm, so that transpiration and deep drainage would be unaffected by the
   vegetation change and the overall water supply enhancement would be much
   less than 6 cm. These results indicate that the change in S-c that may
   follow woody shrub removal is an important criterion to evaluate sites
   for vegetation conversion. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The lizard fauna of sand-mined dunes of the central coast of New South
   Wales, Australia has been shown to be dominated by Ctenotus robustus and
   Ctenotus taeniolatus (Scincidae), with relative abundance changing with
   time since mining. However, there is little published information on how
   this lizard fauna compares to that of the undisturbed open forest that
   previously grew on these sites. Here, existing data are added to in
   order to produce a longer chronosequence of times since sand-mining (4,
   8, 14 and 20 years) than has been examined previously. The new data are
   compared to those from unmined forests. Ctenotus robustus and C.
   taeniolatus dominated lizard captures on mined areas, with peak
   abundances at 8 and 14 years, respectively. Lampropholis guichenoti
   (Scincidae) was at low abundance until 20 years post-mining and L.
   delicata was present only at 20 years post-mining. Unmined forest burned
   4, 8 or 14 years ago had a significantly different lizard community from
   that of sand-mined areas. Ctenotus robustus and C. taeniolatus were
   absent from unmined forest at all post-fire periods. Lampropholis
   guichenoti and Lampropholis delicata were numerically dominant in
   forest, with increasing abundance of L. guichenoti with time since fire.
   Thus the composition of the lizard community on these coastal dunes is
   not solely determined by time since disturbance per se. Comparisons of
   sites on the basis of accumulated leaf litter showed a significant
   relationship between Lampropholis abundance and litter density. On
   sand-mined sites and forested sites with similar leaf litter densities,
   the abundances of L. guichenoti were similar. As Ctenotus were absent
   from unmined forest, we could not compare their distribution in unmined
   and mined areas. However, negative correlations of Ctenotus abundance
   with canopy cover and understorey vegetation density offer a possible
   explanation for the absence of these species from forest.}},

Abstract = {{1. Given the role of fire in shaping ecosystems, especially grasslands
   and savannas, it is important to understand its broader impact on these
   systems. Post-fire stimulation of plant nutrients is thought to benefit
   grazing mammals and explain their preference for burned areas. However,
   fire also reduces vegetation height and increases visibility, thereby
   potentially reducing predation risk. Consequently, fire may be more
   beneficial to smaller herbivores, with higher nutritional needs and
   greater risks of predation.
   2. We tested the impacts of burning on different sized herbivores'
   habitat preference in Serengeti National Park, as mediated by burning's
   effects on vegetation height, live : dead biomass ratio and leaf
   nutrients.
   3. Burning caused a less than 4 month increase in leaf nitrogen (N), and
   leaf non-N nutrients {[}copper (Cu), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg)]
   and a decrease in vegetation height and live : dead biomass. During this
   period, total herbivore counts were higher on burned areas. Generally,
   smaller herbivores preferred burned areas more strongly than larger
   herbivores.
   4. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine the vegetation
   characteristics that explained burned area preference for each of the
   herbivore species observed. However, total herbivore abundance and
   impala (Aepyceros melampus) preference for burned areas was due to the
   increases in non-N nutrients caused by burning.
   5. These findings suggest that burned area attractiveness to herbivores
   is mainly driven by changes to forage quality and not potential
   decreases in predation risk caused by reductions in vegetation height.}},

   and 120 ecodistricts. The Kangwon Ecoregion is located in the centre of
   the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized as dry and
   very windy in spring, and is very susceptible to forest fires. In 1996,
   this ecoregion experienced the largest forest fire ever recorded to that
   time; 3762 ha of forestland were burned. The Korea Forest Research
   Institute has studied the burnt areas extensively, using data on
   regional climate and vegetation, landform and geology, forest soils,
   plant communities, hydrology, pests, wildlife and pine mushrooms. Basic
   principles of restoration were established and long-term ecological
   research has been initiated. A forest fire, six times bigger than that
   of 1996, occurred in Kangwon Ecoregion in 2000. A comprehensive and
   integrated investigation group, including representatives from the
   Forest Service, Ministry of Environment and local and non-governmental

Abstract = {{Questions Open-grown shade trees retained in pastures are legacies of
   agricultural history that influence recolonization dynamics and create
   structural heterogeneity in post-agricultural forests. This work
   addresses the long-term influence of pasture trees on forest structure
   and composition. I ask: Do signs of successional nucleation in
   microhabitat, structure and composition near pasture trees persist
   decades after canopy closure? If so, does variation primarily reflect
   seed deposition or environmental facilitation?
   Location Southeastern Ohio, USA.
   Methods Thirteen open-grown trees greater than 70 cm in diameter in
   second-growth forests 40-90 years old were selected as study sites.
   Trees, saplings, herbs, and environmental variables were sampled and
   compared at three positions around each tree: under the canopy, at the
   dripline, and in the forest matrix.
   Results Soil pH was lower and coarse woody debris most abundant under
   pasture tree canopies. Stems >10 cm in diameter at breast height were
   nearly absent under each focal tree's canopy and most abundant at its
   dripline. Composition under the canopy was limited to shade-tolerant
   trees, whereas the dripline was characterized by vertebrate-dispersed
   species. Ant-dispersed, adhesive, and unassisted herb species were most
   abundant under embedded pasture trees compared with the forest matrix.
   Discussion Evidence of nucleation around open-grown trees persists for
   decades after canopy closure. Contrasts in structure and composition
   reflect spatially segregated interactions of competitive suppression and
   facilitation mediated by both dispersal and environment. Pasture trees
   contribute variation in microhabitat, composition, and structure to
   post-agricultural forests, and their retention should be encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Present uses of prescribed fire in Canada are reviewed. Fire has been a
   natural component of many forested North American landscapes for
   millennia, making it an obvious choice as an effective forest management
   tool. It can be used in harmony with known fire adaptations of
   ecosystems to be managed. Prescribed fire uses are separated into six
   categories: (1) hazard reduction which evolved into (2) silviculture
   (including fire use for site preparation, managing competing vegetation,
   stand conversion, and stand rehabilitation) (3) wildlife habitat
   enhancement (4) range burning (5) insect and disease control (6)
   conservation of natural ecosystems. Some historic developments of
   prescribed fire use are presented including area burned under
   prescription by province and territory. Prescribed fire emerges as a
   cost effective practice that is ecologically compatible with many
   forest, wildlife, and park management objectives. Its continued use in
   the management of Canadian forests seems to be assured, as long as it is
   constantly developed and adapted to the changing needs and priorities of

   Mexico's Maya forest: the effects of clearing method and cleaning on
   seedling survival and growth}},

Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{To mimic catastrophic disturbances which have favored the establishment
   of natural stands rich in mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), two 5000 in
   2 clearings were established in each of four locations using each of
   three treatments: complete felling; slashing, felling and burning; and
   machine-clearing, which uprooted all prior vegetation. One to three
   months later, and again after an additional 12 months, twenty
   4-month-old mahogany seedlings were planted in the center of each
   clearing, and, simultaneously, nearby, under the forest canopy. One year
   after the first planting and again 7 months later, vines and competing
   vegetation were cleaned from around the seedlings on one of each type of
   clearing in each location. Fifty-eight months later, only 5\% of
   mahogany seedlings survived under the canopy, as compared to 32\% on
   felled clearings and 50\% on burned or machine-made clearings. Average
   annual growth of seedlings planted the year clearings were opened was
   approximately double that of seedlings planted a year later, after
   natural regeneration of other species had become established. At 58
   months uncleaned trees averaged 352 cm in height (and the tallest 600
   cm) on burned clearings, 324 cm on machine-made clearings, and 195 cm on
   felled clearings. Surviving seedlings planted under the forest canopy
   had grown less than 30 cm during the same period. On burned and
   machine-made clearings the effect of cleaning on growth was not
   statistically significant, but on felled clearings cleaning increased
   growth by 120\%, to rates similar to those on burned clearings. Attack
   by the Hypsipyla grandella shootborer was significantly affected by
   cleaning. After 58 months, only 12\% of seedlings on uncleaned plots had
   been attacked, compared to 44\% of seedlings on cleaned plots. Cleaning
   also significantly increased vines, particularly on seedlings planted
   the year after clearings were created: 36\% of all seedlings on cleaned
   plots had vines, as compared to 19\% of uncleaned seedlings. In summary,
   planting mahogany seedlings under the forest canopy cannot be expected
   to regenerate mahogany trees. However, mahogany seedlings survive and
   grow well on clearings, with no subsequent interventions, if planted
   shortly after these are opened by machine or burning. This approach to
   regeneration could be expected to yield densities of 100 commercialsized
   mahogany trees/ha among a matrix of 400 naturally regenerated trees/ha
   of other species. At this rate, regenerating mahogany on clearings
   equivalent to 3\% of the annual cutting area intervened at each harvest,
   could provide for replacement of mahogany trees harvested from the
   permanent forest reserves in the region. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The impact of three fire fighting chemicals (FFC) on 11 chemical soil
   properties and on soil recovery (0-2 cm depth) was evaluated 1, 30, 90
   and 365 days after a prescribed fire. Five treatments were considered:
   unburnt soil (US) and burnt soil with 21 m(-2) of water alone (BS) or
   mixed with the foaming agent Auxquimica RFC-88 at 1\% (BS+Fo), Firesorb
   at 1.5\% (BS+Fi) and FR Cross ammonium polyphosphate at 20\% (BS+Ap). At
   t=1 day, soil pH increases in the order US < BS <= BS+Fo, BS+Fi < BS+Ap,
   which was most likely due to the accumulation of ashes, the reduction of
   organic acids and the cations supplied by FFC. In all burnt treatments,
   soil pH remained significantly higher than in US up until t=90 days. SOM
   richness remained similar and constant until t=90 days in all plots,
   but, probably due to fire-triggered erosion, at t=365 days it was
   significantly lower in BS+ Ap (C, N), BS and BS+Fo (C) than in US.
   Immediately after the fire, Soil delta N-15 decreased in all burnt soils
   (significatively in BS+Ap) due to the inputs of N-15 depleted ashes from
   leguminous vegetation. Compared with US, Soil delta N-15 increased
   significantly in all burnt plots between t=90 days (30 days in BS+Ap)
   and t=365 days, suggesting a medium-term fire-triggered increment of N
   Outputs (15 N depleted). As is habitually the case, there was a
   transient post-fire increase of NH4+-N levels (significative for B S +
   FFC plots) that lasted for 30 (BS, BS+Fo and BS+Fi) to 90 days (BS+Ap).
   The high initial NH4+-N levels in BS+Ap (200x that of US; 9-18x those of
   BS, BS+Fo and BS+Fi), and its persistence can delay the post-fire
   vegetation recovery due to the toxicity of NH4+ to seeds and seedlings.
   NO3-N levels changed significantly only in BS+Ap between t=30 and t=90
   days due to the nitrification of its large NH4+-N pool. Except in BS+Ap,
   whose soil P levels were 70-140x (t=1 days) and 10-20x (t=365 days) 4
   higher than in the other treatments, available P content in BS and
   BS+FFC was not significatively higher than in US. The concentrations of
   available cations in BS and BS+FFC were higher (not always
   significatively, except for K) than in US until t=90 days, likely due to
   ashes- and FFC-derived cations. Contrarily to divalent cations,
   monovalent cations (more soluble and easily leached) decreased slowly
   until t=90 days. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Positive and negative signals regulate germination in the post-fire
   annual, Nicotiana attenuata}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{481-494}},

Abstract = {{The litter of many plant species is known to inhibit germination, and
   this phenomenon is commonly interpreted as allelopathic inhibition of
   one species by another. However, an alternative interpretation is that
   seeds may be using environmental signals to inform the timing of their
   germination and thereby use dormancy as a mechanism of habitat choice.
   Nicotiana attenuata Torr ex Wats. (Solanaceae) is typically found for
   less than three years after fire in the sagebrush, blackbrush, and
   pinyon-juniper forests of the Great Basin desert of North America. A
   dormant seed bank is established during this ephemeral post-fire period,
   and pyrolysis products of alpha-cellulose (containing only C, H, and O)
   in wood smoke are known to initiate germination in dormant seeds of this
   species. We demonstrated in a glasshouse experiment that germination
   into burned soils las compared to unburned) results in a 12-fold
   increase in lifetime seed production, which reflects a minimum estimate
   of the fitness benefit of making accurate germination decisions. With
   seed bioassays, we examined the distribution of this smoke signal in the
   A, soil layer at several burned areas in southwestern Utah, United
   States to determine whether the presence of this smoke-derived
   germination cue predicts the spatial and temporal occurrence of N.
   attenuata populations after fires. Although we found no evidence for the
   germination signal in areas that had not been burned for 30 yr, the
   occurrence of the germination signal did not perfectly coincide with the
   distribution of populations. We found evidence for its transport by wind
   and water into adjacent unburned areas (from 40 m to 1 km away from a
   burned site) and its persistence over time (for greater than or equal to
   7 yr), making this signal an unreliable indicator of the plant's
   habitat. To resolve this discrepancy, we examined the effect of unburned
   A, soil horizon on smoke-induced germination. The litter-containing A,
   soil horizon land aqueous extracts thereof), collected from underneath
   seven dominant species from later stages of post-fire succession,
   completely inhibited germination of both dormant and nondormant seeds,
   even in the presence of a smoke cue in excess of that required to elicit
   germination. The inhibitory effect was limited to the early stages of
   germination (48 h after exposure to smoke),and we confirmed these
   results with natural seed banks. We demonstrated that the A, soil
   horizons and their aqueous extracts are not toxic to N. attenuata seeds
   or growing plants, and they have no effect on lifetime seed production.
   Moreover, they do not inhibit the germination of the nondormant,
   conspecific native tobacco, N. trigonophylla, which grows in the same
   area but is not associated with fire. Hence, these negative factors do
   not function in allelopathically mediated competitive interactions
   between N. attenuata and later successional species. We propose that the
   occurrence of N. attenuata populations after fires can be explained by
   the combined stimulatory effect of smoke-derived signals on the dormant
   seed bank and the inhibitory effect of signals from unburned litter, and
   that both signals are required for N. attenuata to identify its
   germination niche.}},

   recovery following managed burning}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{353-359}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prescribed burning in peatlands is controversial due to
   concerns over damage to their ecological functioning, particularly
   regarding their key genus Sphagnum. However, empirical evidence is
   scarce.
   Aims: The aim of the article is to quantify Sphagnum recovery following
   prescribed burns.
   Methods: We completed nine fires at a raised bog in Scotland, achieving
   a range of fire severities by simulating drought in some plots. We
   measured Sphagnum cover and chlorophyll fluorescence F-v/F-m ratio (an
   estimate of photosynthetic capacity) up to 36 months post-fire.
   Results: Cover of dominant Sphagnum capillifolium was similar in unburnt
   and burnt plots, likely due to its high moisture content which prevented
   combustion. Burning decreased S. capillifolium F-v/F-m 5 months after
   fire from 0.67 in unburnt plots to 0.44 in low fire severity plots and
   0.24 in higher fire severity (drought) plots. After 22 months, F-v/F-m
   in burnt plots showed a healthy photosynthetic capacity of 0.76 and no
   differences between severity treatments. Other Sphagnum species showed
   similar post-fire recovery though their low overall abundance precluded
   formal statistical analysis.
   Conclusions: S. capillifolium is resilient to low-moderate fire
   severities and the same may be true for a number of other species. This
   suggests that carefully applied managed burning can be compatible with
   the conservation of peatland ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{We examined jay caching patterns over 3 yr in a woodland-prairie

   the influence of predation on nuts by small mammals on tree recruitment

   Blue jays cached nuts in a wide range of habitats, from open, grassy

   woodland and edge habitats while usually avoiding grassland habitats.
   Caching increased in grassland following a controlled burn. Detection by
   small mammals of artificial nut caches placed by the investigator was
   extremely high.
   The results support a keystone role for blue jays in oak forest
   ecosystems based on their habit of caching large numbers of most acorn
   species in the ground in habitats generally suitable for germination and

   Southern Andean Yungas of Northwest Argentina: a case study}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background Wildfires affect vegetation structure, functions, and other
   attributes of forest ecosystems. Among these attributes, bird
   assemblages may be influenced by the distance from undisturbed to
   fire-disturbed forests. Information about this influence is essential
   for designing management plans aimed at conserving birds' diversity in
   undisturbed forests, which contributes to their sustainability. In
   Northwest Argentina, timber extraction and man-caused fires threaten the
   sustainability of Southern Andean Yungas forests. In this region, we
   evaluated, in relation to a reference unburned forest, the effects of
   close and distant fire-disturbed patches on bird assemblages, exploring
   also relationships between burned and unburned forest structures on bird
   assemblages. On each site, we determined forest structural variables,
   and twice per year, from 2015 to 2017, we recorded birds seen or heard
   on every site, from dawn to 1000 hours, at 30 0.5 ha counting points.
   Results Abundance and richness of bird species were lower in the
   unburned reference site than in close- and distant-burned sites; the
   farther the distance of burned sites to the unburned site, the less
   similarity in bird assemblages. Bird assemblage abundance appeared to be
   associated with snag height and basal area. However, bird species in
   mature forests were present at all sites and outnumbered those typically
   found in forest edges, or secondary or disturbed forests. Conclusions
   Connected areas between unburned and burned forest patches provide
   habitat for birds living in both environments. Preventing forest
   fragmentation by reducing the number and size of wildfires, promoting
   selective timber logging, and banning post-fire snag removal will help
   promote suitable habitat for different bird assemblages and contribute
   to Yungas forests' sustainability. This study is the first step toward
   understanding how fire-patch distances to unburned forests may affect
   bird assemblages in subtropical Southern Andean Yungas forests in South
   America and provide a basis for comparison with other subtropical
   ecosystems around the world.}},

Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, the land area devoted to timber plantations is expanding
   rapidly, especially in the tropics, where reptile diversity is high. The
   impacts of plantation forestry and its management on native species are
   poorly known, but are important, because plantation management goals
   often include protecting biodiversity. We examined the impact of pine
   (Pinus caribaea) plantations, and their management by fire, on the
   abundance and richness of reptiles, a significant proportion of the
   native biodiversity in tropical northern Australia, by (i) comparing
   abundance and diversity of reptiles among pine plantations (on land
   cleared specifically for plantation establishment), and two adjacent
   native forest types, eucalypt and Melaleuca woodlands, and (ii)
   comparing reptile abundance and richness in pine forest burnt one year
   prior to the study to remove understorey vegetation with pine forest
   burnt two years prior to the study. We also examined the influence of
   fire on reptile assemblages in native vegetation, by comparing eucalypt
   woodland burnt two years prior to the study and unburnt for eight years.
   To quantify mechanisms driving differences in reptile richness and
   abundance among forest types and management regimes, we measured forest
   structure, the temperatures used by reptiles (operative temperature) and
   solar radiation, at replicate sites in all forest types and management
   regimes. Compared to native forests, pine forests had taller trees,
   lower shrub cover in the understorey, more and deeper exotic litter
   (other than pine), and were cooler and shadier. Reptile assemblages in
   pine forests were as rich as those in native forests, but pine
   assemblages were composed mainly of species that typically use
   closed-canopy rainforest and prefer cooler, shadier habitats. Burning
   did not appear to influence the assemblage structure of reptiles in
   native forest, but burning under pine was associated with increased
   skink abundance and species richness. Burned pine was not warmer or
   sunnier than unburned pine, a common driver of reptile abundance, so the
   shift in lizard use after burning may have been driven by structural
   differences in understorey vegetation, especially amounts of non-native
   litter, which were reduced by burning. Thus, burning for management
   under pine increased the abundance and richness of lizard assemblages
   using pine. Pine plantations do not support the snake diversity common
   to sclerophyllous native forests, but pine may have the potential to
   complement rainforest lizard diversity if appropriately managed. Crown

Abstract = {{Current goals for prescription burning are focused on measures of fuel
   consumption and changes in forest density. These benchmarks, however, do
   not address the extent to which prescription burning meets perceived
   ecosystem needs of heterogeneity in burning, both for overstory trees
   and understory herbs and shrubs. There are still questions about how
   closely prescribed fires mimic these patterns compared to natural
   wildfires. This study compared burn patterns of prescribed fires and
   managed unplanned wildfires to understand how the differing burning
   regimes affect ecosystem properties. Measures of forest structure and
   fire severity were sampled in three recent prescribed fires and three
   wildfires managed for resource objectives in Sequoia and Kings Canyon
   National Parks. Fine scale patterns of fire severity and heterogeneity
   were compared between fire types using ground-based measures of fire
   effects on fuels and overstory and understory vegetation. Prescribed
   fires and wildfires managed for resource objectives displayed similar
   patterns of overstory and understory fire severity, heterogeneity, and
   seedling and sapling survival. Variation among plots within the same
   fire was always greater than between fire types. Prescribed fires can
   provide burned landscapes that approximate natural fires in many ways.
   It is recognized that constraints placed on when wildfires managed for
   resource objectives are allowed to burn freely may bias the range of
   conditions that might have been experienced under more natural
   conditions. Therefore they may not exactly mimic natural wildfires.
   Overall, the similarity in fire effects that we observed between
   prescribed fires and managed wildfires indicate that despite the
   restrictions that are often placed on prescribed fires, they appear to
   be creating post-fire conditions that approximate natural fires when
   assessed on a fine spatial scale. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   JUNIPER}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{27-48}},
Abstract = {{The decrease in fire activity has been recognized as a main cause of
   expansion of North American woodlands. Pinon-juniper habitat in the
   western United States has expanded in area nearly 10-fold since the late
   1800s. Woodland control measures using chainsaws, heavy equipment, and
   prescribed fire are used to restore sage-brush steppe plant communities.
   We compared vegetation recovery following cutting and prescribed fire on
   three sites in late Phase 2 (mid succession) and Phase 3 (late
   succession) western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) woodlands in
   southeast Oregon. Treatments were partial cutting followed by fall
   broadcast burning (SEP); clear-cut and leave (CUT); and clear-cut and
   burn in early winter (JAN), late winter (MAR), and spring (APR); and
   untreated controls. Cover and density of herbaceous, shrub, and tree
   layers were measured. Five years after treatment, perennial bunchgrasses
   dominated two sites and co-dominated, with invasive annual grasses, at
   one site. Except for Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl), cover
   and density of bunchgrasses, perennial and annual forbs, and annual
   grasses increased following treatments at all three sites and were
   greater than in controls. At each site, shrub, herbaceous, and ground
   cover response variables equalized or had begun to converge among
   treatments during the fourth or fifth year following application. SEP
   and APR treatments were mostly effective at reducing fuel sizes up to
   and including 1000-hr fuels while JAN and MAR treatments only consumed
   1-hr and 10-hr fuels. Winter burning treatments (JAN, MAR) and the CUT
   treatments did not kill small junipers and seedlings and require
   additional tree control for sites to fully recover to functional
   sagebrush-herbaceous plant communities. The results demonstrate that
   juniper treatments are needed to recover sagebrush steppe plant
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Fire regimes in savannas and forests are changing over much of the
   world. Anticipating the impact of these changes requires understanding
   how plants are adapted to fire. In this study, we test whether fire
   imposes a broad selective force on a key fire-tolerance trait, bark
   thickness, across 572 tree species distributed worldwide. We show that
   investment in thick bark is a pervasive adaptation in frequently burned
   areas across savannas and forests in both temperate and tropical regions
   where surface fires occur. Geographic variability in bark thickness is
   largely explained by annual burned area and precipitation seasonality.
   Combining environmental and species distribution data allowed us to
   assess vulnerability to future climate and fire conditions: tropical
   rainforests are especially vulnerable, whereas seasonal forests and
   savannas are more robust. The strong link between fire and bark
   thickness provides an avenue for assessing the vulnerability of tree
   communities to fire and demands inclusion in global models.}},

Abstract = {{Resprouting is an important survival strategy for many plant species
   that allows their survival after fire. The time of fire has been
   identified as one of the factors affecting the ability and vigor of
   resprouting in a variety of ways. It is believed that plants recovering
   after spring fire have a comparative advantage over those recovering
   after autumn fire due to the larger pool of stored carbohydrates in the
   beginning of the growing season which can lead in more vigor
   resprouting. In the current study we present the results of an
   experiment on the effect of fire season, aspect and pre-fire plant size
   on the resprout growth of the common Mediterranean shrub Arbutus unedo
   L. The growth parameters of height and diameter were monitored every 3
   months for the total of 3 years after fire. Fire season has no immediate
   effect on resprout height by the end of the first post-fire growing
   season. It has however an effect on resprout diameter with plants
   recovering after spring fire reaching bigger diameter by the end of the
   first post-fire growing season. Aspect has an important effect on both
   height and diameter of resprouts. The pre-fire plant size was also found
   to be affecting growth of resprouts especially after the second
   post-fire growing season. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{I examined contrasts in response to moderate-intensity fire between two

   southeastern Arizona. Stem survival of pines after lire was greater than
   for oaks, but oaks sprouted more successfully after top-kill than did
   the only sprouting pine species, P, leiophylla. As a result, post-fire
   decline and subsequent recovery in oak populations was more marked than
   for the pines, and the patio of oaks to pines decreased as a result of

Abstract = {{The post-fire butterfly fauna in lowland dipterocarp forest of the Bukit

   species and representing six families were caught in the traps.
   Melanitis leda (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae), Charaxes bernardus

   distributed widely, and having larvae that feed on a wide range of host
   plants. In contrast, other species, such as Trogonoptera brookiana and

Abstract = {{Intervals between fires are critical for the persistence of
   obligate-seeding shrubs, and are often used in planning fires for fuel
   reduction and biodiversity conservation in fire-prone ecosystems
   worldwide. Yet information about the trajectories of reproductive
   performance for such species is limited and information is often
   qualitative. To test existing assumptions about reproductive maturity
   periods for eight obligate-seeding shrubs (with both canopy and soil
   seedbanks) in foothill forests of south-eastern Australia, we used a
   chronosequence approach, with sites from 2 years to >40 years post-fire.
   Quantitative measurements of flowering and fruiting were used to fit
   models of reproductive response in relation to time-since-fire for each
   species. Inferred reproductive maturity for each species, based on
   modelled times to reach 80\% of maximum flower production, varied from 5
   to 18 years post-fire. For a subset of three species, models predicted
   80\% maximum seed production occurring 1-7 years later than flowering.
   Our results confirmed or extended assumptions about post-fire
   reproductive maturity for these species, and provided a basis for
   improved incorporation of plant life-history in ecological fire
   planning. We infer that increased fire frequency makes one of our study

Abstract = {{In regions with a Mediterranean-type climate wildfires are a frequent
   occurrence: In such environments fire tolerant/favoured species are
   frequently encountered. In the Mediterranean basin, many species of fire
   prone habitats are resprouters while others are known to germinate after
   fire. Fire causes an enhancement of seed germination in many species
   from fire prone habitats in the other regions with a Mediterranean-type
   vegetation such as Western Australia, California and South Africa. Seeds
   of a number of these species are stimulated to germinate by the smoke
   generated from burning of plant material in either an aerosol or aqueous
   form. However, for species from the Mediterranean basin the role of
   smoke in germination is poorly known, despite the fact that in the field
   many species seems to be encouraged to germinate after fire. We examined
   the germination of 10 species native to the Mediterranean basin that
   were treated with aerosol smoke. Some species were from fire prone
   habitats while others were not. In relation to the controls, increased
   germination occurred in three of the species (e.g. Cistus incanus),
   three had more rapid germination but no total increase (e.g. Rhamnus
   alaternus), two showed reduced germination (e.g. Asphodelus ramosus) and
   two exhibited no difference in germination (e.g. Clematis flammula).
   There was additionally no consistent pattern of germination behaviour
   depending on the habitat from which the species came. Comparison is made
   between the results of this study and those of other studies on seed
   germination response to heat and smoke in other areas of
   Mediterranean-type climate. An understanding of the importance of fire
   in relation to other disturbances in the vegetation dynamics in the
   Mediterranean basin needs to be clarified by further detailed studies of
   the effect of heat and smoke products on seed germination of
   Mediterranean species. Outcomes of further research, also on a broader
   range of species, would have important impacts also for conservation,
   environment management, horticulture and ecosystem restoration. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The Transverse Ranges of southern California often experience fire
   followed by flood. This sequence sometimes causes post-fire debris flows
   (PFDFs) that threaten life and property situated on alluvial fans. The
   combination of steep topography, highly erodible rock and soil, and
   wildfire, coupled with intense rainfall, can initiate PFDFs even in
   cases of relatively small storm rainfall totals. This study identifies
   common atmospheric conditions during which damaging PFDFs occur in the
   Transverse Ranges during the cool season, defined here as
   November-March. A compilation of 93 PFDF events during 1980-2014
   triggered by 19 precipitation events is compared against previous
   studies of the events, reanalysis, precipitation, and radar data to
   estimate PFDF trigger times. Each event was analyzed to determine common
   atmospheric features and their range of values present at and preceding
   the trigger time. Results show atmospheric rivers are a dominant
   feature, observed in 13 of the 19 events. Other common features include
   low-level winds orthogonal to the Transverse Ranges and other conditions
   favorable for orographic forcing, a strong upper level jet south of the
   region, and moist-neutral static stability. Several events included
   closed low-pressure systems or narrow cold frontal rain bands. These
   findings can help forecasters identify more precisely the synoptic-scale
   atmospheric conditions required to produce PFDF-triggering rainfall and

Abstract = {{Resprouting is a key functional trait for species in disturbance prone
   environments. In many semi-arid environments, woody plants face both
   fire and drought as recurring disturbances. Past work has demonstrated
   that oaks inhabiting sky-island forests of the northern Sierra Madre
   Oriental have differing microhabitat preferences and heavy stem dieback
   occured during the historic 2011 drought indicating potential xylem
   failure. These oak species, representing two sections within the genus,
   are all post-fire resprouters: they can resprout from underground
   storage organs when fire kills above ground tissue. Resprouts provide an
   opportunity to examine how functional traits may change as plastic
   responses to changing environmental conditions. Post-fire resprouts have
   increased root:shoot ratios relative to adults and therefore have access
   to more water relative to leaf demand. We expected that if resprouts
   exhibit plasticity in xylem function, they should favor water transport
   efficiency over safety: they should have higher maximum xylem
   conductivity, but greater susceptibility to drought-induced cavitation.
   We examined four oak species common in the Davis Mountains in west Texas
   and compared adult physiology with that of resprouts following wildfire.
   We found that species differed in degree of desiccation avoidance
   (isohydry) consistent with microhabitat preferences and that the species
   that were most desiccation tolerant as adults had resprouts
   significantly more susceptible to xylem cavitation. We found no evidence
   for a trade-off between efficiency and safety, however.}},

Abstract = {{One strategy of plant survival during post-fire succession is to persist
   and regenerate by recruiting new individuals from a fire-resistant seed
   bank. The heat, smoke, and charcoal released during plant combustion may
   act (individually or in combination) as a cue for post-fire seed
   germination. Fabiana imbricata is a shrub that forms persistent seed
   banks in the northwestern Patagonian grasslands and shows a high
   recruitment from seeds during post-fire succession. Mathematical models
   showed that this species is advancing over the grasslands in response to
   fires. To corroborate these findings, we studied the role of fire on F.
   imbricata seed germination. In order to achieve this, a factorial
   experiment was designed in laboratory conditions to study the effect of
   heat, charcoal, smoke, scarification, and their interactions on F.
   imbricata seed germination. Seeds treated with the higher temperatures
   required a longer period of time to germinate, thus, significantly
   affecting the mean germination time. Total germination percentages in F.
   imbricata were significantly enhanced by smoke and scarification, but
   the interaction of heat, smoke, and scarification was more important
   than the effect of each fire factor alone. The positive response to fire
   cues exhibited by F. imbricata indicates that this species would have an
   adaptive advantage to colonize these grasslands if fire frequency
   increased, as predicted for this environment. Hence, fire will
   contribute to the grassland encroachment by this species and, therefore,

Abstract = {{Surface albedo is one of the most important processes governing climate
   forcing in the boreal forest and is directly affected by management
   activities such as harvesting and natural disturbances such as forest
   fires. Empirical data on the effects of these disturbances on boreal
   forest albedo are sparse. We conducted ground-based measurements of
   surface albedo from a series of instrument towers over 4 years in a
   replicated chronosequence of mixed-wood boreal forest sites differing in
   stand age (to 19 years since disturbance) in both post-harvest and
   post-fire stands. We investigated the effects of stand age, canopy
   height, tree species composition, and ground vegetation cover on surface
   albedo through stand development. Our results indicate that winter and
   spring albedo values were 63\% and 24\% higher, respectively, in
   post-harvest stands than in post-fire stands. Summer and fall albedo
   values were similar between disturbance types, with summer albedo
   showing a transient peak at similar to 10 years stand age. The
   proportion of deciduous broadleaf species showed a strong positive
   relationship with seasonal averages of albedo in both post-harvest and
   post-fire stands. Given that stand composition in mixedwood boreal
   forests generally shows a gradual replacement of deciduous trees by
   conifers, our results suggest that successional changes in species
   composition are likely a key driver of age-related patterns in albedo.
   Our findings also suggest the efficacy of increasing the proportion of
   deciduous broadleaf species as a silvicultural option for
   climate-friendly management of the boreal forest.}},

Abstract = {{Arid shrublands in the Karoo (South Africa) seldom accumulate sufficient
   combustible fuel to support fire. However, as a result of invasion by an
   alien perennial grass (Pennisetum setaceum), they could become
   flammable. This paper reports on an experiment to assess the effects of
   fire following invasion by P. setaceum. We established 10 plots (5 x 10
   m) separated by 2.5 m, and added grass fuel to five plots (5 and 10 tons
   ha-1 to alternate halves of the plot) leaving the remaining five plots
   as interspersed controls. Plots with fuel added were burnt, and fire
   behaviour was measured during the burns. Rates of fire spread were
   generally low (0.01-0.07 m s-1) and did not differ significantly between
   burn treatments. Mean fireline intensities were higher in the high
   compared with the low fuel treatments (894 and 427 kW m-1,
   respectively). We recorded plant species and their cover before and
   after burning on each of the plots. After 15 months of follow-up
   monitoring in the burn plots, only two species, the dwarf shrub
   (Tripteris sinuata) and the perennial herb (Gazania krebsiana)
   resprouted. Most individuals of other species were killed and did not
   reseed during the 15-month study. The mass of added fuel load (high or
   low) did not influence vegetation recovery rates after fire. Should
   future invasions by P. setaceum lead to similar fuel loads in these
   shrublands, inevitable fires could change the vegetation and may favour
   spread of the flammable grass. Our results have important implications
   for predicting the effects of invasive alien plants (especially grasses)
   on fire-free ecosystems elsewhere. The predicted impacts of fire may
   alter species composition, ultimately affecting core natural resources
   that support the Karoo economy.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of hectares of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) forests provide most of
   the wood resource in the northern hemisphere. Among these forests, those
   that are fire-prone concentrate an astonishing diversity of mutualistic
   soil fungi that are pivotal for seedling establishment, tree growth and
   forest functioning and dynamics. Here, we review the effects of fire on
   ECM symbiosis in these forests using a systematic screening of the
   literature. We reveal that a low number of field studies (73) directly
   address fire effect on ECM symbiosis, in a restricted geographic area
   that partially represents the geography of ECM biodiversity stakes and
   fire risk. The analyzed literature consensually reports long-term shifts
   in the composition of ECM fungal communities after fire. Contrastingly,
   the effects of fire on fungal diversity and richness at the local scale
   continue to be debated among researchers, and need to be documented
   further using adequate experimental device to limit the effects of some
   identified methodological biases. Furthermore, our analysis emphasizes
   the urgent need to carefully consider the belowground effects of
   prescribed burning. This is an important conclusion because this widely
   implemented and efficient management tool to prevent wildfires may
   impact ECM soil communities in the same way as uncontrolled events. Our
   analysis finally highlights the need of refining the concept of
   post-fire ECM fungi, by taking advantage of promising tools, such as
   next-generation sequencing and quantitative PCR applied to mycelia and
   spores, to integrate the vegetative traits of fungi in integrative

Abstract = {{Biological invaders can alter ecosystem processes via multiple pathways,
   yet few studies have compared the relative importance of these pathways.
   We assessed the impacts of exotic, invasive grasses on ecosystem
   nitrogen (N) cycling in the seasonal submontane woodlands of Hawaii
   Volcanoes National Park, where native grasses have been historically
   rare. Exotic grasses have become abundant over the past 30 yr and have
   altered two controls over N cycling: plant species composition and fire
   regime. Here we synthesize the results of a long-term investigation of
   species impacts in this system. To determine effects of grasses and fire
   on internal N cycling, we compared litterfall. decomposition, N
   mineralization from soil organic matter (SOM), and plant N uptake and
   production in invaded unburned forest. grass-removal plots within the
   forest, and woodland converted to grassland by fire. We measured
   ecosystem N loss via fire by comparing N pools among unburned, naturally
   burned, and experimentally burned sites. We also assessed the effects of
   fire on annual N fixation in the unburned forest vs. the grassland.
   Exotic grasses had relatively small effects on N cycling in the unburned
   woodland despite being abundant in the understory for 30 yr. Grasses
   contributed similar to 30\% of fine litterfall and primary-production
   mass and N in the unburned woodland. However, these contributions did
   not result in significantly increased totals because litterfall and
   production of Metrosideros polymorpha, the dominant native tree, was
   reduced in the invaded woodland relative to grass-removal plots,
   presumably due to competition with grasses. Although area-weighted
   decomposition was lower in the grass-removal treatment than in the
   control, net N mineralization from litter and SOM were similar between
   these treatments. Annual plant N uptake was similar to annual net N
   mineralization from SOM in both treatments.
   By contrast. the burned grassland exhibited much lower rates of
   litterfall and production mass and N, but higher rates of net N
   mineralization from SOM than the woodland. As a result, total annual
   plant N uptake was only 17\% of annual net mineralization. This change
   was primarily due to the loss of native species. Aboveground N pools
   were significantly reduced with fire. Native species were largely
   eliminated by fire. However, across all burned and unburned sites there
   was no change in total ecosystem N because the N contained in biomass
   was relatively small compared to N in litter and soil. Soil contained >
   95\% of ecosystem N in all sites. Only in the high-intensity
   experimental burn was there significant loss of N from the soil pool.
   Fire reduced N inputs through asymbiotic N fixation mainly due to the
   loss of M. polymorpha, whose litter is an important site of asymbiotic N
   fixation, and alteration of the soil O-layer. This reduction in N inputs
   makes it unlikely that fixation activity will replace N lost via
   combustion before the next fire. Fire and the ensuing loss of native
   species led to decreased N inputs, increased rates of N mineralization
   from litter and SOM. and dramatically reduced plant N uptake,
   potentially leading to a more leaky N cycle. It appears that the
   indirect effects of grasses on N cycling via the elimination of native
   species by fire is the most important pathway though which exotic
   grasses alter ecosystem N dynamics in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Land use history reconstructions in temperate regions of the Northern
   Hemisphere indicate that periods of deforestation are often followed by
   natural afforestation, so that the long-term outcome at the landscape
   level will be a balance of retractions and advances of plant communities
   associated with varying local land uses. During the last decades of the
   XIX century, large forest areas were cleared in Northwestern Patagonia
   to open farmland. In this article, we compared historical land use/land
   cover maps with land cover maps derived from Landsat images to analyze
   the factors that may have influenced the dynamics of land cover change
   of the forest-steppe ecotone during the last 100 years. Our results
   indicate that Patagonian forests underwent a rapid initial recovery
   after the extensive fires of last century, replacing mainly shrublands.
   More than 50\% of the old burns are currently covered by forests, and
   modern fires affect areas characterized by fire-prone vegetation.
   Whereas natural afforestation is an ongoing process positively
   associated with moisture, the rate of forest losses has increased during
   the last three decades, concentrating on xeric aspects and the vicinity
   of roads. We conclude that the outcome of the dynamics between
   fire-intolerant forests and fire-prone plant communities will largely
   depend on human-related activities, modeled by structural features of
   the landscape (i.e., topography, dominant winds), and processes
   triggered by past land uses.}},

   Stem vulnerability to drought-induced embolism and hydraulic

   exposed to 90 degrees C or damaged by a natural forest fire. In
   addition, xylem anatomical changes were examined microscopically.
   Experimental heating caused structural changes in the xylem and
   increased vulnerability in all species. The largest shifts in

   F.sylvatica also showed heat-induced reductions (49\%) in hydraulic

   damaged branches of P.sylvestris and F.sylvatica, and the xylem of
   F.sylvatica was 39\% less conductive in damaged than in undamaged

   These results provide evidence for heat-induced impairment of tree

Abstract = {{Wildfires can significantly alter forest carbon (C) storage and nitrogen
   (N) availability, but the long-term biogeochemical legacy of wildfires
   is poorly understood.
   We obtained a lake-sediment record of fire and biogeochemistry from a
   subalpine forest in Colorado, USA, to examine the nature, magnitude, and
   duration of decadal-scale, fire-induced ecosystem change over the past
   c. 4250 yr. The high-resolution record contained 34 fires, including
   13high-severity events within the watershed.
   High-severity fires were followed by increased sedimentary N stable
   isotope ratios (delta(15) N) and bulk density, and decreased C and N
   concentrations - reflecting forest floor destruction, terrestrial C and
   N losses, and erosion. Sustained low sediment C : N c. 20-50 yr
   post-fire indicates reduced terrestrial organic matter subsidies to the
   lake. Low sedimentary delta(15) N c. 50-70 yr post-fire, coincident with
   C and N recovery, suggests diminishing terrestrial N availability during
   stand development. The magnitude of post-fire changes generally scaled
   directly with inferred fire severity.
   Our results support modern studies of forest successional C and N
   accumulation and indicate pronounced, long-lasting biogeochemical
   impacts of wildfires in subalpine forests. However, even repeated
   high-severity fires over millennia probably did not deplete C or N
   stocks, because centuries between high-severity fires allowed for
   sufficient biomass recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Current concepts of vegetation dynamics include that of the shifting

   among adults and recruits, and not on measurements of actual shifts over
   time. We used aerial photographs to measure transition rates as evidence
   for mosaic shifts among grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and
   oak woodland communities in central coastal California between 1947 and
   1989. In unburned plots without livestock, transition from grassland to
   coastal sage scrub was 0.69\% per year, coastal sage scrub to oak
   woodland was 0.30\% per year, and oak woodland to grassland was 0.08\%
   per year. These transition rates, considered together, indicate that
   vegetation patterns may be dynamic on landscapes dominated by these
   communities. In burned plots without livestock, and in unburned plots
   where livestock were not excluded, transition rates were lower, except
   for the conversion of oak woodland to grassland. In burned plots, a high
   rate of transition of coastal sage scrub to grassland was measured.
   Markov chain models predicted much less directional change in community
   proportions in either grazed or burned conditions than in ungrazed,
   unburned conditions. Some transition rates varied with substrate and
   topographical position, indicating that fire, grazing, and the physical
   environment interacted to determine direction and rate of vegetation
   change. Variation in transition on different substrates suggests that
   only portions of the vegetation of these landscapes may be dynamic, with
   some patches in certain combinations of environment and disturbance that

Abstract = {{Edge effects on tropical faunas may differ between highland and lowland
   sites and may therefore require different conservation strategies. In
   northwestern Ecuador, we examined the frog fauna on both sides of a
   boundary between wet Andean forest and agricultural lands, asking the
   following questions: ( 1 ) What is the nature of the response of frogs
   to edge? ( 2 ) Does the response change with land use? ( 3 ) What
   conservation measures are suggested by the first two questions? We set
   up 12 study plots along 16 km of convoluted boundary in one watershed.
   Each plot contained an agricultural parcel bordering a rectangle
   extending into the forest. In the dry season of 1996, following local
   tradition each agricultural parcel was cleared of second-growth
   vegetation and then burned, planted, cultivated, and ( in six cases )
   harvested 1 year later. Half the parcels were planted in pasture
   grasses; the others were planted with corn and beans. We randomly
   assigned each treatment to two sites within each of three blocks. At
   each site, parallel to the boundary we set up eight all transects, four
   on the forest side of the boundary and four on the agricultural side. We
   censused frogs in plots with visual-encounter surveys along all
   transects in four different seasons from just after planting to just
   before crop harvest. Regardless of land use or survey date, frog-capture
   frequencies changed abruptly at the forest-agriculture boundary and then
   remained constant regardless of distance into the forest or into the
   cultivated parcels. Forest transects provided 95\% of the 2111 captures;
   all but 5 captures were of Eleutherodactylus spp. ( Leptodactylidae).
   Eleutherodactylus leoni dominated the forest frog fauna but was rare
   throughout agricultural parcels. The second most common species, E.
   w-nigrum , displayed the opposite pattern. The stepwise nature of these
   responses differs from results of studies in tropical lowlands and
   suggests that edge effects that might penetrate from highland
   agriculture into cloud forest may be of far less conservation concern
   than the absolute loss of habitat as the agricultural boundary creeps
   upslope. This suggestion should be viewed with caution because the scope
   of our study included only one watershed, two idiosyncratic land-use
   treatments, and a unique vertebrate taxon.}},

Abstract = {{In the southern boreal forest (Quebec, Canada), tree harvesting is a
   major disturbance affecting the dominant black spruce (Picea mariana)
   stands already suffering from naturally recurrent insect and fire
   disturbances. Although recovery of the spruce forest after an insect
   infestation or a fire is possible under current site conditions, it is
   less likely when both types of disturbance occur during a short period
   of time. The addition of yet another disturbance, such as tree
   harvesting, can thus have catastrophic consequences. We analyzed the
   impact of three successive disturbances-tree harvesting, insect
   infestation, and fire-on the regeneration of boreal spruce-moss forests
   within a period of approximately 50 years. The spruce forests were
   harvested in the 1940s and the 1950s. Recovery from the logging
   consisted of advance regeneration (spruce layers less than 1 m high that
   were left intact during clear-cuts), which was burned in 1991. The
   vegetation cover (mostly heath and lichen species) and soil conditions
   (acidic, nutrient-poor podzolic soils developed from coarse materials)
   of the postfire sites that we studied were similar. Stand structure and
   tree regeneration were documented from large quadrats (0.25 ha) using
   age, size, and tree ring data from postlogged and postfire spruce. At an
   early stage of development, the growing advance regeneration was damaged
   by insect defoliators in the late 1970s and the mid-1980s, and several
   trees died a few years before the 1991 fire. The successive disturbances
   considerably reduced the number of seed-bearers, leading to the collapse
   of postfire regeneration and a shift to parkland. Through a successional
   trajectory far from the expected trend for boreal forests influenced by
   single disturbance, the shift resulted in the formation of divergent
   plant communities. The development of divergent communities at the
   landscape scale is generally overlooked due to their small size. They
   indicate, however, the weak resilience of boreal forests faced with
   cascading perturbations, which are likely to increase in intensively
   logged areas.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Tree cover is a key variable for ecosystem functioning, and is widely
   used to study tropical ecosystems. But its determinants and their
   relative importance are still a matter of debate, especially because
   most regional and global analyses have not considered the influence of
   agricultural practices. More information is urgently needed regarding
   how human practices influence vegetation structure. Here we focused in
   Central Africa, a region still subjected to traditional agricultural
   practices with a clear vegetation gradient. Using remote sensing data
   and global databases, we calibrated a Random Forest model to
   correlatively link tree cover with climatic, edaphic, fire and
   agricultural practices data. We showed that annual rainfall and
   accumulated water deficit were the main drivers of the distribution of
   tree cover and vegetation classes (defined by the modes of tree cover
   density), but agricultural practices, especially pastoralism, were also
   important in determining tree cover. We simulated future tree cover with
   our model using different scenarios of climate and land-use (agriculture
   and population) changes. Our simulations suggest that tree cover may
   respond differently regarding the type of scenarios, but land-use change
   was an important driver of vegetation change even able to counterbalance
   the effect of climate change in Central Africa.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{312-321}},

Abstract = {{Questions
   Has fire suppression relaxed barriers to the exchange of species between
   savanna and forest? Do all species or a subset of species participate in
   this exchange? Would current vegetation structure persist if fire
   suppression were to cease?
   Location
   A gallery forest edge in the Cerrado region of central Brazil that
   burned only once in the past 35 years.
   Methods
   Density of tree seedlings, saplings and adults, leaf area index (LAI),
   tree basal area and diameter were surveyed in 12, 10 m x 70 m transects
   centred on and perpendicular to the forest-savanna boundary. Community
   composition was assessed using non-metric multi-dimensional scaling
   (NMDS).
   Results
   Basal area and LAI declined substantially from forest to savanna, with
   an associated shift in species composition. Savanna tree species were
   nearly absent in the forest, but accounted for the majority of stems in
   the savanna. In contrast, forest species comprised 14\% of adults and
   more than one-third of juveniles in the savanna. Despite the high
   diversity of trees (85 species) in the forest, five species play a
   particularly large role in this initial phase of forest expansion.
   Reintroduction of fire, however, would result in widespread topkill of
   juveniles and the majority of adult forest trees, thereby interrupting
   the succession towards forest.
   Conclusions
   After 35 years during which the site burned only once, the savanna still
   remains dominated by savanna species. Nevertheless, the dominance of
   forest juveniles in border and savanna tree communities suggests that
   with a continued policy of fire suppression, the forest will continue to
   expand.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decades, Portugal like several other Mediterranean countries
   has been affected by frequent wildfires. This has led to various field
   tests of post-fire soil conservation measures and, in particular,
   mulching with forest slash residues. While forest residue mulching was
   shown to be highly effective in reducing post-fire erosion, its side
   effects on soil fauna communities have not been studied and are also
   difficult to predict from the - scarce - literature on mulch effects in
   general. Therefore, this study compared the abundance, diversity and
   taxonomic and functional composition of the ground-dwelling arthropod
   communities of three mulched and, as control, three untreated erosion
   plots of roughly 100m(2) that had been installed in a eucalypt
   plantation almost immediately after a wildfire in 2010, some five years
   earlier. This was done using three pitfall traps per plot, placed at the
   lower, middle and upper part of the study slope. Roughly five years
   after mulching, its impacts on the ground-dwelling arthropod were rather
   limited, especially compared to its effect on overall soil erosion
   rates. One of the few exceptions was the abundance of the Hymenoptera -
   one of the most frequently occurring orders - which was significantly
   lower in the mulched than control plots. This and other near significant
   mulching impacts found in this study plainly justify a follow-up study
   on short-term effects. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a critical component of terrestrial ecosystems and essential to
   understand the composition and diversity of communities in fire-prone
   regions. Nevertheless, fire does not act alone, and other factors such
   as land-use type and vegetation structure can also operate at different
   scales, prompting the response to fire of ectotherm communities such as
   reptiles. We have evaluated the influence of environmental factors on
   the abundance, diversity, and richness of reptile communities in Serra
   da Estrela Natural Park (northern Portugal), at both the landscape and
   micro-habitat scales. In spring 2014 and 2015, 20 transects were
   surveyed eight times, the vegetation structure and composition were
   measured, and the extent of land-use types around each transect
   calculated in this Mediterranean community. At the landscape scale,
   reptile abundance was higher in natural woodlands and more complex
   habitats (higher vegetation heterogeneity and plant richness), and
   reptile evenness was affected by vegetation heterogeneity and time since
   fire. By contrast, species richness was not related to any environmental
   fact\& measured in this study. Only two lizard species were common in
   the park, Psammodromus algirus and Podarcis guadarramae. Their relative
   abundances increased with contrasting habitat variables as the former is
   a ground-dwelling lizard specialist that prefers heterogeneous (unburnt)
   habitats and the second is a rock lizard that selects open (burnt)
   stands, At the micro-habitat scale, the probability of reptile presence,
   reptile abundance, and reptile richness increased with plant richness
   and decreased with tree cover. This study highlights the importance of
   several environmental factors, that operate from micro-habitat to
   landscape scales to understand the response of reptiles to fire.}},

Abstract = {{We used a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image from the 2011 Wallow fire
   in Arizona, USA, in combination with field data to assess different
   methods for determining fire severity. These include the normalised burn

   the burned fraction (BF) estimated by spectral mixture analysis (SMA).
   The Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) and vegetation mortality data were
   used as ground truth. Of all the remotely sensed measures evaluated the
   dNBR had the best performance (GeoCBI-dNBR R-2 = 0.84), which supports
   the operational use of the dNBR for post-fire management. Of the other
   remotely sensed measures, the SMA-derived BF also had moderately high
   correlations with the GeoCBI (R-2 = 0.66). Both approaches demonstrated
   their usefulness for refining modelled CC values, however, the SMA
   approach has the advantage of providing transferable quantitative
   estimates without the need for calibration with field data. The carbon
   emission estimates that included fire severity were more than 50\% lower
   than the estimate derived from modelling alone. These results suggest
   that for certain fire types, especially mixed-severity fires, current
   emission estimates are significantly overestimated, which will affect
   global carbon emission estimates from wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effect of wildfire and salvage harvesting on
   runoff generation and sediment exports from three small forest
   catchments in south-eastern Australia. In 2006, wildfire burnt a radiata
   pine catchment and two adjacent natural eucalypt forest catchments which
   formed part of a long-term hydrological research project. Subsequently,
   only the pine plantation catchment was salvage harvested. The combined
   effect of fire and salvage harvesting in the pine catchment caused a
   substantial increase in runoff compared to the burnt eucalypt forest
   catchments and pre-fire conditions, particularly in response to high
   intensity, short duration summer storms. Post-fire maximum suspended
   sediment concentrations from fixed-interval sampling greatly exceeded
   pre-fire values for both eucalypt and pine catchments, while sediment
   (suspended and bedload) exported from the pine catchment exceeded each
   of the eucalypt catchments by a minimum of 180 and 33 times. However,
   the export increase was probably closer to 320 and 71 times based on a
   survey of eroded channels in the pine catchment combined with measured
   post-survey exports. Notably, seven summer storm events accounted for
   approximately 80\% of the pine catchment sediment yield. Hillslope
   process measurements indicated that the highest runoff velocities
   occurred in log drag-lines formed by cable harvesting, while soil water
   repellency was more extensive in the harvested pine catchment than in
   the adjacent eucalypt catchment. The latter effect probably resulted
   from higher burn severity in the pines combined with reduced soil
   moisture due to less shading after harvesting. Runoff modelling
   indicated that the log drag-lines acted as an extension to the drainage
   network and increased peak flows at the harvested catchment outlet by
   48\% for a high intensity summer storm event, while substantial
   reductions in modelled runoff were achieved through increasing the
   hillslope surface roughness coefficient. It is recommended that
   post-fire salvage operations should avoid the formation of log
   drag-lines when using cable harvest techniques and maximise surface
   cover to limit increases to runoff, erosion and catchment sediment
   exports. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of fires on Cerambycidae, Buprestidae and Lucanidae were
   studied at 23 sites within a chestnut forest in southern Switzerland. We
   compared six unburnt sites, two freshly burnt sites, eight sites which
   burned once at different times in the last 30 years, and seven sites
   where fires occurred repeatedly in the last 30 years. The diversity and
   the species composition of the three xylobiont families were related to
   various ecological variables at two levels of spatial scale, a small
   scale of 0.25 ha and a large scale of 6.25 ha. These variables were:
   fire frequency, time since the last fire, clear cutting after the fire,
   forest structure, amount of dead wood, and habitat mosaic. The fire does
   not have a direct effect on the xylobiont beetles community at small
   scale; however, fire has an indirect effect by maintaining a relatively
   open forest structure. The mosaic of forest areas burnt with different
   frequencies and at different times was an important factor influencing
   species richness and species composition at the large spatial scale.
   Data presented here supports the strategy to conserve the diversity and
   includes species composition of xylobiont fauna in deciduous forests:
   (i) at small spatial scale, to maintain highly structured and relatively
   open stands with large amounts of dead wood and big oak trees; (ii) at
   large spatial scale, to favour a mosaic of different forest habitats and

Abstract = {{Sagebrush-steppe ecosystems are one of the most threatened ecosystems in
   North America due to woodland expansion, wildfire, and exotic annual
   grass invasion. Some scientists and policy makers have suggested that
   woodland expansion will lead to increased carbon (C) storage on the
   landscape. To assess this potential we used data collected from a Joint
   Fire Sciences Program demonstration area to develop a Microsoft Excel
   (TM) based biomass, carbon, and nitrogen (N) spreadsheet model. The
   model uses input for tree cover, soil chemistry, soil physical
   properties, and vegetation chemistry to estimate biomass, carbon, and
   nitrogen accumulation on the landscape with woodland expansion. The
   model also estimates C and N losses associated with prescribed burning.
   On our study plots we estimate in treeless sagebrush-steppe ecosystems,
   biomass accounts for 4.5 Mg ha(-1) C and 0.3 Mg ha(-1) N this is <10\%
   of total estimated ecosystem C and N to a soil depth of 53 cm, but as
   tree cover increases to near closed canopy conditions aboveground
   biomass may account for 62 Mg ha(-1) C and 0.6 Mg ha(-1) N which is
   nearly 53\% of total estimated ecosystem C and 13\% of total estimated
   ecosystem N to a soil depth of 53 cm. Prescribed burning removes
   aboveground biomass, C and N, but may increase soil C at areal tree
   cover below 26\%. The model serves as a tool by which we are able to
   assess our understanding of the system and identify knowledge gaps which
   exist for this ecosystem. We believe that further work is necessary to
   quantify herbaceous biomass, root biomass, woody debris decomposition,
   and soil C and N with woodland expansion and prescribed fire. It will
   also be necessary to appropriately scale these estimates from the plot

Abstract = {{1. Arid ecosystems are often vulnerable to transformation to
   invasive-dominated states following fire, but data on persistence of
   these states are sparse. The grass/fire cycle is a feedback process
   between invasive annual grasses and fire frequency that often leads to
   the formation of alternative vegetation states dominated by the invasive
   grasses. However, other components of fire regimes, such as burn
   severity, also have the potential to produce long-term vegetation
   transformations. Our goal was to evaluate the influence of both fire
   frequency and burn severity on the transformation of woody-dominated
   communities to communities dominated by invasive grasses in major
   elevation zones of the Mojave Desert of western North America.
   2. We used a chronosequence design to collect data on herbaceous and
   woody cover at 229 unburned reference plots and 578 plots that burned
   between 1972 and 2010. We stratified the plots by elevation zone (low,
   mid, high), fire frequency (1-3 times) and years post-fire (YPF; 1-5,
   6-10, 11-20 and 21-40 YPF). Burn severity for each plot was estimated by
   the difference normalized burn ratio.
   3. We identified two broad post-fire successional pathways. One was an
   outcome of fire frequency, resulting in a strong potential
   transformation via the grass/fire cycle. The second pathway was driven
   by burn severity, the critical aspect being that long-term
   transformation of a community could occur from just one fire in areas
   that burned at high or sometimes moderate severity. Dominance by
   invasive grasses was most likely to occur in low-and high-elevation
   communities; cover of native herbaceous species was often greater than
   that of invasive grasses in the mid-elevation zone.
   4. Synthesis. Invasive grasses can dominate a site that burned only one
   time in many decades at high severity, or a site that burned at low
   severity but multiple times in the same time period. However, high burn
   severity may predispose areas to more frequent fire because they have
   relatively high cover of invasive annual grass, suggesting burn severity
   and fire frequency have both independent and synergistic effects.
   Resilience in vegetation structure following fire in many arid
   communities may be limited to a narrow window of low burn severity in
   areas that have not burned in many decades.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is an important but often controversial
   fire-management tool in fire-prone regions of the world. Here, we
   explore the complex challenges of prescribing fire for multiple
   objectives in the eucalypt forests of southwestern Australia, which
   could be regarded as a model for temperate landscapes elsewhere.
   Prescribed fire has been used in a coordinated manner to manage fuels in
   Australia's eucalypt forests since the 1950s and continues to be an
   important tool for mitigating the impacts of unplanned wildfires on
   human society and on a broad range of ecosystem services. Prescribed
   fire is increasingly being used to manage fire regimes at the local and
   landscape scales to achieve biodiversity outcomes through maintenance of
   spatial and temporal patterns of post-fire seral stages. The prescribed
   burning program in southwestern eucalypt forests has been informed by a
   long-term program of applied research into fire behavior and fire
   ecology. To remain successful in the future, the prescribed burning
   program in this region will need to adapt to changing expectations of
   government and the community, emerging land-use issues, resource
   limitations, and a drying climate.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate interactions between successive naturally occurring
   fires, and assess to what extent the environments in which fires burn
   influence these interactions. Using mapped fire perimeters and
   satellite-based estimates of post-fire effects (referred to hereafter as
   fire severity) for 19 fires burning relatively freely over a 31-year
   period, we demonstrate that fire as a landscape process can exhibit
   self-limiting characteristics in an upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed
   conifer forest. We use the term `self-limiting' to refer to recurring
   fire as a process over time (that is, fire regime) consuming fuel and
   ultimately constraining the spatial extent and lessening fire-induced
   effects of subsequent fires. When the amount of time between successive
   adjacent fires is under 9 years, and when fire weather is not extreme
   (burning index <34.9), the probability of the latter fire burning into
   the previous fire area is extremely low. Analysis of fire severity data
   by 10-year periods revealed a fair degree of stability in the proportion
   of area burned among fire severity classes (unchanged, low, moderate,
   high). This is in contrast to a recent study demonstrating increasing
   high-severity burning throughout the Sierra Nevada from 1984 to 2006,
   which suggests freely burning fires over time in upper elevation Sierra
   Nevada mixed conifer forests can regulate fire-induced effects across
   the landscape. This information can help managers better anticipate
   short-and long-term effects of allowing naturally ignited fires to burn,
   and ultimately, improve their ability to implement Wildland Fire Use
   programs in similar forest types.}},

Abstract = {{Although boreal herb-rich forests are important ecosystems for
   maintaining biological diversity in Fennoscandia, their ecology, flora
   and ecological gradients are still poorly known and their classification
   remains somewhat unclear. The aim here was to explore quantitatively
   which are the most important environmental factors related to
   distribution patterns in the herb-rich forest vegetation. Altogether 101
   herb-rich forest stands in the Koli area, eastern Finland, were studied.
   In order to find out whether vascular plants (n = 165) and bryophytes (n
   = 100) reflect different environmental factors, they were subjected
   separately to Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The results
   indicated that the most important environmental factor was site
   moisture, while others were soil acidity, the intensity of water flow,
   stoniness, land use history and exposure. Bryophyte distribution
   correlated better with N, Ca and soil moisture than did the distribution
   of vascular plants, while vascular plants were more closely reflected
   earlier land use, altitude and Mg. Differences between eight `A priori'
   herb-rich forest site types were studied by non-parametric test. The
   herb-rich forests studied here can be classified in terms of moisture
   into: (1) sub-dry and mesic, (2) mesic-moist and (3) moist and wet
   sites. Sites also formed clear groups after moisture gradient, location
   and land use history or exposure. Traditional herb-rich forest site
   types did not form clear groups after environmental gradients. Deciduous
   stands, hemerophilous species and podsol and peat mull soils are common
   in the herb-rich forest studied as a result of long-term human impacts,

Abstract = {{In the boreal forests of interior Alaska, feedbacks that link forest
   soils, fire characteristics, and plant traits have supported stable
   cycles of forest succession for the past 6000 years. This high
   resilience of forest stands to fire disturbance is supported by two

   and plant-soil-microbial feedbacks that regulate soil organic layer
   thickness and the cycling of energy and materials, and (ii) interactions
   among soil conditions, plant regeneration traits, and plant effects on
   the environment that maintain stable cycles of forest community
   composition. Unusual fire events can disrupt these cycles and trigger a
   regime shift of forest stands from one stability domain to another (e.
   g., from conifer to deciduous forest dominance). This may lead to abrupt
   shifts in forest cover in response to changing climate and fire regime,
   particularly at sites with intermediate levels of moisture availability
   where stand-scale feedback cycles are only weakly constrained by
   environmental conditions. However, the loss of resilience in individual

Abstract = {{Extensive parts of subtropical South America are covered by grassland
   vegetation, despite climatic conditions that allow for forest
   development, and fire may have been an important factor in the
   evolutionary history of these grasslands. In a regularly burned
   grassland area, situated in a forest-grassland-mosaic near Porto Alegre,
   RS, Brazil, life form spectrum and plant species' reaction to fire were
   examined, allowing for (1) a physiognomic description of the grassland,
   and (2) a functional classification of grassland species in relation to
   fire. Grassland sites with different time since the last fire occurred
   were compared between each other as well as to sites at the
   forest-grassland border. South Brazilian grassland is dominated by
   hemicryptophytic caespitose graminoids that resist fires, but contains a
   large number of geophytic or hemicryptophytic forbs, in general
   sprouting after fire. Shrubs, mostly sprouting species of the grassland
   community, were present with high cover values even in recently burned
   areas. In contrast to Central Brazilian Cerrado, trees were of little
   importance: most species found were forest pioneer species without the
   capacity to survive fires unless growing on sites protected from fire or
   at the forest border where burns stop. Non-sprouting species were of
   little importance in the community, and only two species found were

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Invasive annual grasses have become increasingly important components of
   desert vegetation in North America. They are especially problematic
   because they increase the extent, severity, and frequency of fire in
   desert shrublands that normally experience fire very rarely, or not at
   all. After fire, invasive grasses and forbs are often dominant and
   restoration methods are required to promote native plant recovery. Three
   treatments to control invasive annual grasses and forbs were implemented
   in the first 3 years following a fire in creosote bush scrub vegetation.
   Treatments included early season mechanical removal (raking) of all
   annuals, grass-specific herbicide (Fusilade II), and Fusilade II plus
   hand pulling of exotic forbs. In the first year, all treatments reduced
   invasive annual grass abundance by about half but had little effect on
   native annuals. Treatment effectiveness was minimal in the first year
   due to low and irregular distribution of rainfall. In the second year,
   insufficient rainfall prevented the germination of any annual plants and
   no treatments were applied. In the third year, precipitation onset
   occurred later in the season and was above average. Although the raking
   treatment performed poorly, treatments utilizing Fusilade II nearly
   eliminated invasive grasses and forbs, achieved native annual dominance,
   and increased native perennial abundance. These results indicate that in
   the absence of invasive grasses and forbs, the native annual community
   can be resilient to fire disturbance and native perennials can recover.
   The results also suggest that burned creosote bush shrublands can be
   managed after fire to decrease the chance of invasive plant-fire
   feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Although hazardous fuels reduction projects are being implemented widely
   in dry forests of the western United States, information concerning
   ecological responses of pinyon-juniper woodlands to fuels treatments is
   minimal. In this study we used a randomized block experimental design to
   investigate effects of fuels treatments on understory responses at a
   pinyon-juniper woodland site in northern Arizona. Treatment alternatives
   replicated (n = 12) on 1-ha units across the 760-ha site were thinning
   from below (Thin), prescribed burning, (Burn), thinning followed by
   prescribed burning (Thin + Burn), and untreated controls (Control). We
   measured cover of vascular plant species, biological soil crust, and
   forest floor substrate prior to treatment and one year, 2 years, and
   five years post-treatment. After five years, Thin and Thin + Burn plots
   showed statistically similar total plant cover but both showed
   significantly greater cover than Burn and Control plots. Cover increases
   on Thin + Burn plots were driven mainly by annual forb and nonnative
   species groups. Graminoid species with the C-4 photosynthetic pathway
   showed significantly greater cover in all treatment groups compared with
   Control plots. Burning alone tended to reduce shrub cover whereas
   thinning alone tended to increase shrub cover. We found no significant
   effects of treatment on cover of biological soil crust or bare soil.
   Regression analysis showed significant negative relationships between
   total understory plant cover and overstory canopy cover on burned and
   unburned plots. We found no significant effect of treatment on species
   richness over the measurement period. We observed 124 taxa in total, and
   mean richness ranged from 31.8 to 36.8 species per 500 m(2) in 2011.
   Similar to results for plant cover, we found significantly greater
   numbers of annual forb species in Thin + Burn compared with Control
   plots and significantly greater numbers of nonnative species in Thin +
   Burn compared with all other treatment groups. Permutational
   multivariate analysis of variance showed no significant differences in
   overall plant community composition among treatments. These results
   indicate that fuel reduction treatments on woodland sites may not
   dramatically affect understory abundance or composition within five
   years. Although treatments did not significantly differ in cover of
   biological soil crust or bare soil - indicators of ecosystem function -
   our results showed that thinning treatments followed by prescribed fire
   led to increases in cover of nonnative plant species. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of fire on the abundance and
   alpha diversity of ants based upon data published over the past 70
   years. Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 \%, but had no effect
   on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect
   of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire
   significantly decreased ant diversity in forests-especially in tropical
   forests-whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not.
   Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in
   sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity
   where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests,
   wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does
   prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant
   differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of
   forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times
   post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast,
   fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna
   ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic
   location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire,
   and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that
   habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to
   fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite
   variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature
   of fire effects on ants.}},

Abstract = {{Background Fires have a fundamental impact on phytocoenoses and,
   depending on the size of the fire, can have a positive or negative
   effect. The role of fires in the formation of the species composition of
   plants, restoration of stands and changes in soil properties is well
   studied. However, the long-term relationship between forest management
   methods, soil properties and epigeic entomofauna assemblages in
   post-fire areas is still not clear. The effects of Scots pine stand
   management methods on biochemical soil properties and ground beetle
   assemblages in the largest post-fire area in Central Europe after the
   second World were investigated. The study was conducted in the Rudy
   Raciborskie Forest district in southern Poland. The soil properties and
   epigeic beetle community structure were analysed. The research covered
   areas with natural and artificial pine regeneration, which were
   subjected to various care treatments. Results The tendency for higher
   accumulations of organic matter in the soil of stands that underwent
   natural regeneration was proven. The stimulating role of soil organic
   carbon on the activity of dehydrogenases in the soil of naturally
   renewed areas with silvicultural treatment (NRAT) was noted. Regardless
   of the manner of stand regeneration, the activity of beta-glucosidase
   was higher in the areas in which breeding treatments were practised.
   Furthermore, managed forest stands presented a higher abundance of
   carabid beetles than stands without treatment practices. Thirteen
   epigeic beetle species from the families Geotrupidae, Carabidae,
   Curculionidae, Cerambycidae and Silphidae were captured, with beetles
   from the first two families being the most numerous. Rare epigeal
   carabid species in the fauna of Poland and Europe, such as Carabus
   glabratus (Paykull) and Carabus auronitens Fabr., found appropriate
   habitat conditions for survival in the post-fire areas. Compared with
   the other areas, in the NRAT area, there were better stand and soil
   properties and more features conducive to epigeic entomofaunal
   occurrences. The highest post-fire content of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons was recorded in the soils of the sites that underwent
   artificial regeneration. The results suggest that preparing the soil
   before the introduction of new vegetation affects the amount of aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs). Conclusions The better performance of the NRAT
   stand draws attention to the positive aspects of the use of natural
   regeneration, both from ecological and economic perspectives. The
   effects of forest management on the amount of soil organic matter after
   fires have been proven. The natural regeneration of stands was conducive
   to the accumulation of organic matter. The enzymatic activity of soils
   is influenced by the renewal method and forest management strategy. The
   NRAT area was characterized by the highest number of carabid species.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands have been lost and degraded in the United States since
   Euro-American settlement due to agriculture, development, introduced
   invasive species, and changes in fire regimes. Fire is frequently used
   in prairie restoration to control invasion by trees and shrubs, but may
   have additional consequences. For example, fire might reduce damage by
   herbivore and pathogen enemies by eliminating litter, which harbors eggs
   and spores. Less obviously, fire might influence enemy loads differently
   for native and introduced plant hosts. We used a controlled burn in a
   Willamette Valley (Oregon) prairie to examine these questions. We
   expected that, without fire, introduced host plants should have less
   damage than native host plants because the introduced species are likely
   to have left many of their enemies behind when they were transported to
   their new range (the enemy release hypothesis, or ERH). If the ERH
   holds, then fire, which should temporarily reduce enemies on all
   species, should give an advantage to the natives because they should see
   greater total reduction in damage by enemies. Prior to the burn, we
   censused herbivore and pathogen attack on eight plant species (five of
   nonnative origin: Bromus hordaceous, Cynosuros echinatus, Galium
   divaricatum, Schedonorus arundinaceus (=Festuca arundinacea), and
   Sherardia arvensis; and three natives: Danthonia californica, Epilobium
   minutum, and Lomatium nudicale). The same plots were monitored for two
   years post-fire. Prior to the burn, native plants had more kinds of
   damage and more pathogen damage than introduced plants, consistent with
   the ERH. Fire reduced pathogen damage relative to the controls more for
   the native than the introduced species, but the effects on herbivory
   were negligible. Pathogen attack was correlated with plant reproductive
   fitness, whereas herbivory was not. These results suggest that fire may
   be useful for promoting some native plants in prairies due to its
   negative effects on their pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Chaparral shrublands burn in large high-intensity crown fires. Managers
   interested in how these wildfires affect ecosystem processes generally

   metrics. In shrublands burned in the autumn of 2003, a study of 250
   sites investigated factors determining fire severity and ecosystem
   responses.
   Using structural equation modeling we show that stand age, prefire shrub
   density, and the shortest interval of the prior fire history had
   significant direct effects on fire severity, explaining >50\% of the
   variation in severity.
   Fire severity per se is of interest to resource managers primarily
   because it is presumed to be an indicator of important ecosystem
   processes such as vegetative regeneration, community recovery, and
   erosion. Fire severity contributed relatively little to explaining
   patterns of regeneration after fire. Two generalizations can be drawn:
   fire severity effects are mostly short-lived, i.e., by the second year
   they are greatly diminished, and fire severity may have opposite effects
   on different functional types.
   Species richness exhibited a negative relationship to fire severity in
   the first year, but fire severity impacts were substantially less in the
   second post fire year and varied by functional type. Much of this
   relationship was due to alien plants that are sensitive to high fire
   severity; at all scales from 1 to 1000 m(2), the percentage of alien
   species in the post fire. ora declined with increased fire severity.
   Other aspects of disturbance history are also important determinants of
   alien cover and richness as both increased with the number of times the
   site had burned and decreased with time since last fire.
   A substantial number of studies have shown that remote-sensing indices
   are correlated with field measurements of fire severity. Across our
   sites, absolute differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) was strongly
   correlated with field measures of fire severity and with fire history at
   a site but relative dNBR was not. Despite being correlated with fire
   severity, absolute dNBR showed little or no relationship with important
   ecosystem responses to wild fire such as shrub resprouting or total
   vegetative regeneration. These findings point to a critical need for
   further research on interpreting remote sensing indices as applied to
   post fire management of these shrublands.}},

Abstract = {{Gaps are often important microhabitats for recruitment of herbaceous
   plants. In the Florida scrub, fires create gaps by top-killing
   resprouting shrubs. These natural gaps are aboveground gaps (without
   aboveground vegetation) that may also be complete gaps (if belowground
   roots and rhizomes are absent). Within three types of gaps (natural
   gaps, experimental aboveground and experimental complete gaps), we
   studied seedling recruitment and survival of spontaneous species and
   seven sown herbs for two years. We created aboveground gaps by clipping
   vegetation and complete gaps by removing shrub roots and rhizomes. These
   gaps occurred in two Florida scrub habitats: rosemary scrub and scrubby
   flatwoods. We also explored factors that can affect recruitment patterns
   in gaps, such as soil moisture, root water retention and light
   availability. In addition, we tested effects of supplemental watering on
   sown seeds in the field since drought in 2000 and 2001 suppressed
   natural seedling recruitment. The watering treatment increased
   recruitment in all types of gaps. Over half of all gaps were colonized,
   but there were few seedlings. Recruitment was highest in watered,
   complete gaps in scrubby flatwoods, where the soil moisture levels were
   higher and light levels lower than in the other gap types. Seedlings of
   a single spontaneously recruited species (Lechea deckertii) were more
   abundant than sown species. Locally common gap specialists were more
   abundant than generalists. Because many of these gap specialists are
   endangered plant species, understanding how disturbances create
   microsites for their regeneration is critical for conservation and
   management of the Florida scrub ecosystem. In small-scale conservation
   projects, artificially created gaps may substitute for post-fire gaps
   when prescribed burning is impossible.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major disturbance factor influencing the formation and
   maintenance of oak (Quercus)-dominated forests of eastern North America.
   Fire suppression practices have resulted in declining oak dominance, and
   caused the loss of oak seedlings due to poor light regimes and
   vegetative competition. Both wildfires and prescribed fires can alter
   forest stand composition and influence succession. Fire can also cause
   physiological changes in plants, potentially influencing growth,
   competition, and susceptibility to herbivory. Fire may impact herbivore
   populations directly by altering habitat and abundance, or indirectly
   through alterations in food supply. The objective of my study was to
   assess the effects of a naturally occurring wildfire on chestnut oak (Q.
   prinus L.) seedling growth, foliar chemistry, and suitability to a
   generalist herbivore, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.). I sampled
   chestnut oak seedlings four times for phytochemical analysis throughout
   the post-fire growing season, and sampled once to assess suitability for
   caterpillar performance and to measure seedling growth. Chestnut oak
   seedlings sampled from burned sites had significantly higher foliar
   nitrogen and water content than seedlings sampled from non-burned sites.
   Seedlings from burned sites had transient declines in foliar
   carbohydrate concentrations, and also had higher initial tannin levels.
   Although seedlings from burned sites were smaller with respect to stem
   diameter and height, they grew more with respect to absolute growth
   rate, leaf area, and biomass, than their non-burned counterparts. In
   spite of the differences in leaf chemistry, there were no significant
   differences in the growth or development of gypsy moth caterpillars fed
   foliage from burned versus non-burned seedlings. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Volume = {{353}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The fire ecology of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is poorly
   understood. We analyzed beech recruitment after a mast year in recently
   burnt and unburnt stands to answer to the questions: (i) Does post-fire
   mast seed production and recruitment in beech depend on fire severity,
   and (ii) which are the processes by which fire and the environment
   affect beech seed production, germination and seedling emergence and
   establishment in the first year after masting?
   We selected three beech stands in the Southwestern Alps, burnt in either
   the winter of 2012 or 2013 but before the 2013 beech mast year. In the
   summer of 2013, at each stand, we established 30 sampling plots
   stratified by fire severity based on the percent basal area loss of
   beech (low; intermediate; high). Another 10 plots per stand were
   assigned to a control (unburnt) group. In the spring of 2014, we counted
   cupules, seeds, germinated seeds, and emergent seedlings (i.e., rooted
   in mineral soil) in four squares (0.4 x 0.4 m) at each plot. In the
   summer of 2014, at each plot, we measured stand characteristics (i.e., a
   circular area of 12-m in a planar radius) and counted established
   seedlings in 12 squares (1 x 1 m).
   Control stands had 448 +/- 38 cupules m(-2) and 489 +/- 44 seeds m(-2)
   with a germination rate of 11\%. In comparison to the control,
   production of cupules and seeds was significantly lower only under high
   fire severity (-75\% and -63\%, respectively). At intermediate and low
   severity sites, cupule and seed production were similar to unburnt
   sites, while seed germination and seedling emergence were higher. At
   intermediate severity sites established seedlings (86,000 +/- 10,574
   seedlings ha(-1)) were significantly more frequent than the control.
   Generalized linear and additive models demonstrated that intermediate
   disturbance of litter and canopy cover favored beech regeneration.
   Mixed severity fires are an important ecological factor for the natural
   regeneration of beech. Such insights in beech disturbance ecology can
   help improve silviculture and post-fire restoration of Alpine forests.
   The synergy between fire and masting raises new-questions concerning the
   role of fire in temperate beech forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Successfully managing invasive plants in natural systems is extremely
   difficult. Recently however, progress has been made with an approach
   focused on changing ecosystem processes through the disturbance regime.
   We performed a large-scale (3 ha) full-factorial field experiment in
   densely invaded woodland in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, a savanna reserve in
   South Africa, to study the effect of fire on the control of the
   pan-tropical invasive exotic shrub Chromolaena odorata in combination
   with the conventional method, i.e. manual clearing and herbicide
   application. We show how fire interacted with the conventional clearing
   of C. odorata and induced an intense canopy fire that caused a shift
   from woodland to grassland. After 2.5 years of monitoring, grasses were
   still dominant and re-invasion minimal. It is important to note that
   fire without prior clearing did not have the same effect and was not
   successful in reducing densities of C. odorata. An integrated control
   practice targeting the species with mechanical and chemical methods,
   while simultaneously targeting its habitat through fire, effectively
   controlled dense C. odorata thickets during the course of the
   experiment. However, this approach transformed regular surface fires
   into high-intensity canopy fires that are rare in savannas. We discuss
   how this altered fire regime may threaten native habitats, including
   fire-sensitive forest patches and riverine woodlands within the savanna
   mozaic. This is an important dilemma for managers that should not be
   overlooked and asks for long-term data on the impact of control programs
   on the native vegetation.}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Dead wood remaining after wildfires represents a biological legacy for
   forest regeneration, and its decay is both cause and consequence of a
   large set of ecological processes. However, the rate of wood
   decomposition after fires is still poorly understood, particularly for
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed deadwood
   decomposition following a wildfire in a Mediterranean pine plantation in
   the Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (southeast Spain). Three
   plots were established over an elevational/species gradient spanning
   from 1477 to 2053 m above sea level, in which burnt logs of three
   species of pines were experimentally laid out and wood densities were
   estimated five times over ten years. The logs lost an overall 23\% of
   their density, although this value ranged from an average 11\% at the
   highest-elevation plot (dominated by Pinus sylvestris) to 32\% at an
   intermediate elevation (with P. nigra). Contrary to studies in other
   climates, large-diameter logs decomposed faster than small-diameter
   logs. Our results provide one of the longest time series for wood
   decomposition in Mediterranean ecosystems and suggest that this process
   provides spatial variability in the post-fire ecosystem at the scale of
   stands due to variable speeds of decay. Common management practices such
   as salvage logging diminish burnt wood and influence the rich ecological
   processes related to its decay.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{425-434}},
Abstract = {{Frequent fires on drought-prone grasslands, such as pastures in the
   sub-Mediterranean region, can induce large post-fire variations of CO2
   fluxes between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. Consequently,
   substantial changes in the C-cycle can be expected. In our research, we
   studied post-fire carbon fluxes (net canopy CO2 exchange (NE) and canopy
   respiration) on calcareous karst grassland after two spring fire events,
   a natural one in 2010 and a man-induced (anthropogenic) one in 2011.
   Canopy chamber measurements performed at short regular time intervals
   throughout the season revealed the rapid recovery of NE after the
   initial loss of C-sink strength. The long-term effects of the natural
   fire were largely masked by an early-season drought. In contrast, the
   burned areas did not reach the productivity of non-disturbed sites until
   the end of the season after the anthropogenic fire in 2011, when the
   post-burning period was characterised by favourable growing conditions.
   The similar NE values could be explained by a significant reduction of
   respiration at burned areas. Our research showed that C-sink strength of
   grassland after a fire disturbance can be re-established quite rapidly,
   after a month, although a full recovery (regeneration of plant cover, C
   fluxes) can take more time. The re-establishment is largely dependent on
   environmental conditions (soil water availability).}},

Abstract = {{The use of prescribed fire is integral to the restoration of open
   woodlands and savannas, including shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)
   woodlands in the Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Fire
   offers many potential benefits to numerous wildlife; however, short-term
   implications for understory fruit production are not fully understood,
   especially in stands subjected to frequent, recurrent burns. We examined
   the effects of dormant season prescribed burns on woody fruit production
   (kg ha(-1)) and fruit producing vegetative cover in the understory of
   restored pine woodlands. We inventoried 32 stands during four temporal
   periods after dormant season prescribed fires: 1, 2, 3, and 5 growing
   seasons post-burn. We counted fruit (< 2m above the ground) throughout
   the summer and visually estimated vegetative cover of fruit producing
   plants. Fruit production was greatest in the 3rd year (18.2 kg ha(-1)),
   followed by 5th (10.9 kg ha(-1)) and 2nd (9.8 kg ha(-1)) years after
   bums. Overall, 87\% of total production consisted of three genera:
   American beautyberry (Calliccupa americana {[}38\%]), Vitis spp. (summer
   grapes {[}Vitis aestivalis; 11\%] and muscadine grape {[}V.
   rotundifolia; 10\%]), and Rubus spp. (blackberry {[}20\%] and dewberry
   {[}R. flagellaris; 8\%]). Production was recorded in 13 of the 14 fruit
   producing species present during the 5th year post-burn, indicating that
   production diversity increased over time. Percent cover and species
   richness (26 taxa) of fruit producing taxa were greatest in the 3rd year
   post-bum. Taxa such as poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) and sumac
   (Rhus spp.) comprised a sizable percent of coverage (> 7\% each), but
   this did not translate into substantial fruit production. American
   beautyberry and summer grape had both substantial coverage and
   production. Results suggest that burning on a 3-year rotation maximizes
   and prolongs fruit production; however, occasional burning on a 5-year
   rotation will promote a higher diversity of woody mast-producing
   understory species.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation managers of oak woodlands have been reintroducing fire both
   as an ecological process per se and to assist in restoring native plant
   communities. To increase our understanding of the impacts of
   reintroduced fire on ground-dwelling invertebrates we examined the
   response of ants and spiders to a late season (autumn) prescribed fire
   conducted in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland ecosystem in
   northern California. Twelve 100 m x 100 m plots were established, six
   plots received a burn treatment and the remaining six plots were
   unburned controls. Ants and spiders were sampled using pitfall traps
   left open continuously and collected approximately every 32 days.
   Sampling was conducted over a year, consisting of four pre-burn and nine
   post-burn collections. Abundance was analyzed using a repeated measures
   ANOVA, which showed seed-harvester ants decreased significantly in the
   two months following the fire. Total spider abundance also showed a
   significant decrease in two months, although this did not occur
   immediately after the burn. One spider hunting guild, the `diurnal
   ambush' group (Thomisidae) remained suppressed for up to nine months.
   Correspondence analysis measures of ant species abundance with
   environmental and vegetation variables (percent rock, bare ground, plant
   species richness and height of herbaceous vegetation) were higher than
   expected by chance, which assists in explaining some of the responses.
   Findings from this study revealed that the reintroduction of autumn

Abstract = {{Fires and herbivores shape tropical vegetation structure, but their
   effects on the stability of tree cover in different climates remain
   elusive. Here, we integrate empirical and theoretical approaches to
   determine the effects of climate on fire- and herbivore-driven
   forest-savanna shifts. We analyzed time series of remotely sensed tree
   cover and fire observations with estimates of herbivore pressure across
   the tropics to quantify the fire-tree cover and herbivore-tree cover
   feedbacks along climatic gradients. From these empirical results, we
   developed a spatially explicit, stochastic fire-vegetation model that
   accounts for herbivore pressure. We find emergent alternative stable
   states in tree cover with hysteresis across rainfall conditions. Whereas
   the herbivore-tree cover feedback can maintain low tree cover below
   1,100 mm mean annual rainfall, the fire-tree cover feedback can maintain
   low tree cover at higher rainfall levels. Interestingly, the rainfall
   range where fire-driven alternative vegetation states can be found
   depends strongly on rainfall variability. Both higher seasonal and
   interannual variability in rainfall increase fire frequency, but only
   seasonality expands the distribution of fire-maintained savannas into
   wetter climates. The strength of the fire-tree cover feedback depends on
   the spatial configuration of tree cover: Landscapes with clustered low
   tree-cover areas are more susceptible to cross a tipping point of
   fire-driven forest loss than landscapes with scattered deforested
   patches. Our study shows how feedbacks involving fire, herbivores, and
   the spatial structure of tree cover explain the resilience of tree cover
   across climates.}},

Abstract = {{We assess a replicated fire plot experiment undertaken between 1973 and
   1996 in two Eucalyptus-dominated savanna vegetation formations (open
   forest, woodland), at Munmarlary, in monsoonal northern Australia. Four
   treatments, each with three replicates, were imposed on each vegetation
   type: annual early dry-season burning; annual late dry-season burning;
   biennial early dry-season burning; and unburned controls. Treatments
   were imposed faithfully, with noted exceptions, on 1-ha plots. Fire
   intensities were typically low (<1000 kW/m) to moderate (1000-2500
   kW/m), varied significantly between treatments, and generally were
   greater in woodland. In both woodland and open forest, pH was
   significantly lower and NO(3)-N was significantly higher in unburned
   plots. Organic C was not significantly greater. in unburned treatments.
   Effects of fire regime on other soil chemical properties differed
   between open forest and woodland sites. Among the grasses, invariant
   frequent burning led to the dominance of a small number of annual
   species, notably regionally dominant Sorghum. In the absence of burning,
   annuals declined generally, whereas some perennials increased while most
   decreased. These responses usually were apparent within the first five
   years of the experiment. At the relatively, small spatial scale of the
   grass sampling regime, there was high turnover of both annual and
   perennial grasses. Under low- to moderate-intensity, frequent burning
   regimes, woody vegetation dominated by mature eucalypts is structurally
   stable. In the absence of burning for at least five years, there was
   release of the non-eucalypt, woody component into the midstory; this
   occurred more rapidly in open forest. Accession of rain forest species
   occurred on some woodland plots, especially the unburned treatment. In
   contrast, eucalypts were not released significantly from the understory.
   Rather, as suggested by other studies, recruitment of eucalypts into the
   canopy appears to involve significantly reduced root competition through
   death of dominant eucalypts. Although the Munmarlary experiment provides
   invaluable quantitative data for exploring relationships between fire
   regimes and the responses of north Australian savanna systems, it has

   through modest, targeted ``adaptive management{''} studies, involving

Abstract = {{Landsat imagery was used to study the relationship between a remotely
   sensed burn severity index and prefire vegetation and the postfire
   vegetation response related to burn severity within a 1986 burn in

   years after the fire, and a chronosequence of remotely sensed vegetation
   index values was analyzed as a surrogate of vegetation recovery.
   Remotely sensed burn severity varied by vegetation class, with
   needle-leaf forest classes experiencing higher burn severity than
   broadleaf forest or broadleaf shrubland classes. Burn severity varied by
   cover within needle-leaf classes. Elevation also had an influence on
   burn severity, presumably as a result of there being less fuel above the
   treeline. Several large broadleaf areas at the fire perimeter appeared
   to act as fire breaks. A remotely sensed vegetation index peaked 8-14
   years after the fire, and increase in the vegetation index was highest
   within the highest burn severity class. Self-replacement appeared to be
   the dominant successional pathway, with prefire needle-leaf forest
   classes mostly succeeding to needle-leaf woodland and with prefire
   broadleaf forest mostly succeeding to broadleaf shrubland. Because the

   postfire depth of organic soil.}},

Abstract = {{Natural wildfire regimes are important for ecosystem succession but can
   have negative ecological effects depending on fire characteristics. A
   portion of a granite rock barrens landscape that extends along the
   eastern shoreline of Georgian Bay, Lake Huron to eastern Ontario,
   Canada, burned in 2018 during a wildfire that affected >11,000 ha. This
   landscape is a biodiversity hotspot providing habitat for many species
   at risk where freshwater turtles nest in soil deposits in cracks and
   crevices in the bedrock dominated by moss (Polytrichumspp.) and lichen
   (Cladoniaspp.) cover. To assess the initial effect of wildfire on
   freshwater turtle nesting habitat, we measured soil depths and estimated
   moss, lichen, and vascular plant cover at 2 morphology types (crevice,
   flat) in burned and unburned areas of the landscape. The probability
   that burned flat plots supported soil was near zero; the burned flat
   plots had 98\% less soil volume compared to unburned flat plots.
   Although crevices were more resistant to soil loss, burned crevices
   still had a 15\% lower probability of having soil and 35\% less soil
   volume compared to unburned crevice plots. We estimated nest site
   availability by calculating the number of locations with shallow (5-10
   cm), intermediate (10-20 cm), and deep (>20 cm) soils required for a
   small (5 cm x 5 cm) or medium (10 cm x 10 cm) nest chamber. Overall, the
   burned open rock barrens had 71-73\% fewer sites with suitable soil
   depth and volume for a nest chamber of either size. Furthermore, burned
   plots had almost no lichen and moss cover but were dominated by bare
   soil, forbs, and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) seedlings. Although the
   loss of tree cover in previously forested areas may increase nest site
   availability for freshwater turtles in newly open areas, we suggest that
   organic soil combustion and soil erosion may require restoration
   activities in the post-fire landscape to support successful nesting of
   at-risk turtles. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{In October of 2017 a series of rural fires affected Portugal's Central

   districts. A monitoring program was initiated in 5 catchments of the
   Mondego drainage basin, in order to understand the temporal evolution of
   the water's physical and chemical characteristics in a post-fire
   scenario. This monitoring program was implemented in catchments with
   sizes between 20 km(2) and 160 km(2) in areas 60\%-99\% burnt. For each
   catchment a gauging point was selected near the mouth of the river.
   These 5 gauging points were assessed monthly, starting one month after
   the fire, in November 2017, and ending in June 2018. In each campaign
   stream water was sampled for laboratory analysis and in-situ
   physical-chemical proprieties were measured. Major ions in water samples
   were determined through ion chromatography (IC) and molecular absorption
   spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission
   spectrometry (ICP-OES). Trace elements were evaluated through ICP-OES
   and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Total organic carbon
   and dissolved organic carbon were evaluated through the oxidation method
   and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined by high-performance
   liquid chromatography. The data collected was crossed with the
   catchment's morphometric, geological and land use data, including
   characteristics of the burnt area.
   Results showed that these fires affected the surface waters in the

   different fire history regimes (twice-burnt, recently-burnt, old burnt,
   and unburnt). The effect of fire was detected when focusing on
   functional traits rather than species. Ground nesting bees were
   positively associated with recently-burnt sites, which provide bare soil
   and therefore nesting sites for this group of bees. Polylectic bees were
   positively associated with twice-burnt sites, indicating the dominance
   of generalist bee species. Larger bees were positively associated with
   post-tire age, probably due to the larger foraging range of larger bees
   that enables a more efficient exploitation of aggregated resources, Our

Abstract = {{Knowledge of soil erodibility following wildfire is of crucial
   importance for prioritisation of post-fire restoration practices for
   soil erosion mitigation. The present work therefore aims to determine
   the effect of wildfire on soil erodibility for common woodlands in
   Galicia. NW Spain. This is done by comparing selected topsoil properties
   of 28 pairs of recently wildfire-burned and neighbouring unburned sites
   on different geologic substrates. The soil properties were selected for
   their supposed importance in erodibility, and include aggregate size
   distribution and water aggregate stability. Comparison of the burned and
   unburned sites suggested that wildfire had a noticeable negative effect
   on aggregate size distribution but not on particle size distribution.
   The effect on aggregate stability was highly variable. Aggregate
   stability was clearly lower at the burned than unburned site in about a
   third of the cases and in the remaining cases either basically the same
   at both sites or higher at the unburned site. The differences in
   aggregate stability, like those in aggregate size distribution, appear
   to be associated with changes in organic carbon content. The impact of
   wildfire on soil erodibility is supposed to operate through its effect
   on soil organic matter and, thus. to depend strongly on tire severity.
   Soil erodibility is then little affected by low-severity wildfires but
   markedly diminished following high-severity wildfires. All burned
   topsoils were strongly to very strongly water repellent. Fire-enhaced
   repellency is therefore viewed as a key factor in the post-tire runoff
   and erosion processes repeatedly observed in recently burned areas in NW

Abstract = {{The effect of prescribed fire on suspended sediment and nutrient exports

   prescribed fire was applied to both catchments, followed in 2006 by a
   second burn applied to riparian areas of one catchment, with the other
   catchment utilised as a control for this burn. Historic pre-fire weekly

   sampling to quantify the effect of the fires. The 2005 fire resulted in
   a significant difference (P = 0.000) in suspended sediment

   suspended sediment (11.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and total phosphorous

   peak suspended sediment exports only slightly exceeded the average
   annual load from a nearby undisturbed catchment. Well-below-average
   rainfall in 2006 resulted in lower exports after this burn compared with
   the 2005 fire. The results highlighted the importance of hydrological

   surface vegetation recovery is likely to mitigate any burns effects.}},

Abstract = {{While fire shapes the structure of forests and acts as a keystone
   process, the details of how fire modifies forest structure have been
   difficult to evaluate because of the complexity of interactions between
   fires and forests. We studied this relationship across 69.2 km(2) of
   Yosemite National Park, USA, that was subject to 32 fires >= 40 ha
   between 1984 and 2010. Forests types included ponderosa pine (Pious
   ponderosa), white fir-sugar pine (Abies concolor/Pinus lambertiana), and
   red fir (Abies magnifica). We estimated and stratified burned area by
   fire severity using the Landsat-derived Relativized differenced
   Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR). Airborne LiDAR data, acquired in July
   2010, measured the vertical and horizontal structure of canopy material
   and landscape patterning of canopy patches and gaps. Increasing fire
   severity changed structure at the scale of fire severity patches, the
   arrangement of canopy patches and gaps within fire severity patches, and
   vertically within tree clumps. Each forest type showed an individual
   trajectory of structural change with increasing fire severity. As a
   result, the relationship between estimates of fire severity such as
   RdNBR and actual changes appears to vary among forest types. We found
   three arrangements of canopy patches and gaps associated with different
   fire severities: canopy-gap arrangements in which gaps were enclosed in
   otherwise continuous canopy (typically unburned and low fire
   severities); patch-gap arrangements in which tree clumps and gaps
   alternated and neither dominated (typically moderate fire severity); and
   open-patch arrangements in which trees were scattered across open areas
   (typically high fire severity).
   Compared to stands outside fire perimeters, increasing fire severity
   generally resulted first in loss of canopy cover in lower height strata
   and increased number and size of gaps, then in loss of canopy cover in
   higher height strata, and eventually the transition to open areas with
   few or no trees. However, the estimated fire severities at which these
   transitions occurred differed for each forest type. Our work suggests
   that low severity fire in red fir forests and moderate severity fire in
   ponderosa pine and white fir-sugar pine forests would restore vertical
   and horizontal canopy structures believed to have been common prior to
   the start of widespread fire suppression in the early 1900s. The fusion
   of LiDAR and Landsat data identified post-fire structural conditions
   that would not be identified by Landsat alone, suggesting a broad
   applicability of combining Landsat and LiDAR data for landscape-scale
   structural analysis for fire management. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Wildland fires are one of the more severe disturbances for natural
   ecosystems in the Mediterranean basin and can become a critical factor
   in the process of soil erosion. A quantitative assessment of soil
   erosion is needed in order to form an assessment on the extent and
   magnitude of post-fire soil erosion potential and to assess the
   effectiveness of the rehabilitation treatment. On 21 August 2006, a
   large wildland fire occurred in the Kassandra Peninsula in northern
   Greece, which burned one fifth of the Peninsula. After the fire, in
   order to protect the soil against erosion, the Forest Services applied a
   hillslope rehabilitation treatment of contour-felled logs and branch
   piles. In this paper, we report quantitative estimation of the wildland
   fire and erosion control treatment on soil erosion potential. The
   coupling of the Universal Soil Loss Equation and the Geographical
   Information Systems was implemented and the erosion potential was found
   to be 2.8 t/ha/year pre-fire, 29.5 t/ha/year post-fire, and 21.3
   t/ha/year after rehabilitation treatment. The model can successfully
   contribute in the planning of the rehabilitation treatment but it cannot
   be used in the quantification of the soil loss after the application of
   the erosion control measures. The comparisons between the results of the
   three cases indicate the importance of the immediate erosion control
   measures in order to mitigate soil loss and restore the natural
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in stream chemistry were studied for 4 years following large
   wildfires that burned in Glacier National Park during the summer of
   2003. Burned and unburned drainages were monitored from December 2003
   through August 2007 for streamflow, major constituents, nutrients, and
   suspended sediment following the fires. Stream-water nitrate
   concentrations showed the greatest response to fire, increasing up to
   tenfold above those in the unburned drainage just prior to the first
   post-fire snowmelt season. concentrations in winter base flow remained
   elevated during the entire study period, whereas concentrations during
   the growing season return to background levels after tow snowmelt
   seasons. Annual export of total nitrogen from the burned drainage ranged
   from 1.53 to 3.23 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared with 1.01 to 1.39 kg ha(-1)
   yr(-1) from the unburned drainage and exceeded atomspheric inputs for
   the first two post-fire water years. Fire appeared to have minimal
   long-term effects on other nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and
   major constituents with the exception of sulfate and chloride, which
   showed increased concentrations for 2 years following the fire. There
   was little evidence that fire affected suspended-sediment concentrations
   in the burned drainage. Sediment yields in subalpine streams may be less
   affected by fire than in lower elevation streams because of the slow
   release rate of water during spring snowmelt. Published in 2008 by John

Abstract = {{Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is a potential source of
   ecological information. Typically TEK has been documented at the species
   level, but habitat data would be equally valuable for conservation
   applications. We compared the TEK forest type classification of
   riberenos, the non-indigenous rural peasantry of Peruvian Amazonia, to a
   floristic classification produced using systematically collected
   botanical data. Indicator species analysis of pteridophytes in 300 plots
   detected two forest types on non-flooded tierra firme, each associated
   with distinct soil texture and fertility, and one forest type in areas
   subject to flooding. Nine TEK forest types were represented in the same
   set of plots. Each TEK forest type was consistently (> 82\%) associated
   with one of the three floristic classes and there were also clear
   parallels in the ecological characterizations of the forest types.
   Riberenos demonstrated clear preferences for certain forest types when
   selecting sites for slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting. Our results

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{179}},
Number = {{1-3}},

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Shortening of fallow periods due to pressure on land by population
   growth is a common problem throughout the forest zone of West and
   Central Africa. Crop yields after short-term fallows with natural
   vegetation are often low as a consequence of low nutrient availability
   to crops. Planted tree fallows may offer an alternative to natural
   fallows for improving short fallow-crop cycles if trees accumulate and
   therefore retain more nutrients in the system.
   Calliandra calothyrsus (Meissner) (calliandra) trees (3947 ha(-1)) were
   planted at different spatial patterns into 18 farmers' fields in six
   villages, covering a wide range of soil and rainfall conditions in the
   forest zone of Cameroon. After 2 year of fallow calliandra tree fallows
   had produced between 18.9 and 25.0 Mg ha(-1) of above-ground dry matter,
   significantly more than 14.3 and 17.3 Mg ha(-1) of dry matter in 2- and
   4-5-year old natural fallows, dominated by Chromolaena odorata. Planting
   trees in alleys and in equidistant pattern produced more biomass than
   planting in clusters and around the plot borders. The, tree fallows
   accumulated above-ground on average 225 kg N ha(-1), significantly more
   than 168 kg N ha(-1) in natural fallows. Alley-planted trees accumulated
   more P (19 kg ha(-1)) than natural fallows (14 kg P ha(-1)), but no
   difference in K-Ca-Mg accumulation was found. Between 57 and 65\% of the
   biomass in the tree fallows was stem-wood of calliandra, and 23-27\% in
   branch wood. Nutrients in these components are unavailable for annual
   crops if not burned. Planting trees in clusters and dense lines around
   the border reduced the stem-wood mass. The stem-wood of calliandra.
   contained on average 18\% of the total fallow N, 21\% of the P, 28\% of
   the K, 16\% of the Ca, and 14\% of the Mg. Export of calliandra stems
   for firewood would, therefore, lead to substantial nutrient losses from
   the system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{615-626}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{West European heathlands are often of high conservation value, but
   throughout the region their area has declined steeply in recent years.
   Heath is a semi-natural vegetation type, owing its origins and
   maintenance to human use and management. In addition to direct
   destruction of heathland and its habitats, loss has resulted from
   abandonment of traditional management practices followed by successional
   change to other vegetation types (e. g. woodland, scrub, Pteridium
   aqudinum, grassland). To illustrate some of the ecological effects of
   management, five kinds of traditional practice arc reviewed: grazing,
   controlled burning, cutting, turf stripping or sod cutting ('turbary',
   `plaggen' etc.) and periodic cultivation. A feature common to all is the
   continuous or periodic depletion of the nutrient fund contained in the
   system, or at least prevention of nutrient accumulation. Abandonment of
   management permits accumulation, which may be increased by inputs from
   polluted rainfall. In addition, traditional practices (apart from
   grazing) have tended to create dense, even-aged stands of Calluna
   vulgaris (or other Ericaccous species).
   A return to traditional management will secure the conservation of
   heathland landscapes. But nature conservation in heathland requires not
   only maintenance of the typical physiognomy, but also full
   representation of characteristic plant and animal communities, and
   creation of structural heterogeneity and horizontal mosaic. To some
   extent careful management of grazing animals may achieve these aims, but
   this is often difficult to achieve in practice. It may be necessary to
   have recourse to cutting, burning or turf-stripping, with modifications
   to allow application on a small-patch basis. This will produce a mosaic
   of stands of varying age. Frequency of treatment can be varied to
   provide opportunities for pioneer species as well as those of mature or
   degenerate stands. Certain elements of the flora or fauna may require
   special measures.}},

Volume = {{360}},
Pages = {{205-212}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the effects that oak forest regeneration
   treatments consisting of a combination of shelterwood harvesting and
   prescribed fire have on bats, despite increasing use of these
   treatments. We quantified changes in bat activity levels in relation to
   oak forest regeneration treatments consisting of harvesting at 50\% and
   70\% retention levels and prescribed fire in two upland Appalachian
   hardwood forests in Ohio. We monitored bat activity immediately
   post-harvest, three growing seasons post-harvest, and after application
   of prescribed fire to harvested stands before the fourth growing season.
   Total bat activity levels were higher in thinned and thinned and burned
   treatments than in unthinned controls in all years, but did not differ
   between harvest treatment levels immediately post-harvest, three growing
   seasons post-harvest, or between harvest treatment levels within years.
   Total bat activity post-prescribed fire changed only in the 50\%
   retention harvest treatment blocks, wherein activity decreased. Activity
   levels of big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) bats were greater in harvested
   treatment blocks than controls in all years. Activity levels of eastern
   red (Lasiurus borealis), and Allyotis spp. and tri-colored (Perimyotis
   subflavus) collectively did not differ among treatment blocks post-fire,
   but were greater in harvested treatment blocks than controls three
   growing seasons post-harvest. Community composition was strongly related
   to vegetation volume, with eastern red bats and Myotis and tri-colored
   bats displaying positive relationships with clutter in low height
   strata, and big brown bats displaying a negative relationship with
   clutter in all height strata. The positive relationship between eastern
   red and Myotis and tri-colored bats and clutter in low height strata may
   explain why activity levels of these species decreased post-prescribed
   fire. Our study suggests that the harvesting component of oak forest
   regeneration treatments may benefit bats for several years, and that
   while bat activity levels may decline post-prescribed fire, overall
   activity levels are nonetheless greater than in unthinned areas. (C)

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the influence of climate variability and fire
   characteristics in shaping postfire vegetation recovery will help to
   predict future ecosystem trajectories in boreal forests. In this study,
   I asked: (1) which remotely-sensed vegetation index (VI) is a good proxy
   for vegetation recovery? and (2) what are the relative influences of
   climate and fire in controlling postfire vegetation recovery in a
   Siberian larch forest, a globally important but poorly understood
   ecosystem type? Analysis showed that the shortwave infrared (SWIR) VI is
   a good indicator of postfire vegetation recovery in boreal larch
   forests. A boosted regression tree analysis showed that postfire
   recovery was collectively controlled by processes that controlled seed
   availability, as well as by site conditions and climate variability.
   Fire severity and its spatial variability played a dominant role in
   determining vegetation recovery, indicating seed availability as the
   primary mechanism affecting postfire forest resilience. Environmental
   and immediate postfire climatic conditions appear to be less important,
   but interact strongly with fire severity to influence postfire recovery.
   If future warming and fire regimes manifest as expected in this region,
   seed limitation and climate-induced regeneration failure will become
   more prevalent and severe, which may cause forests to shift to
   alternative stable states.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fire-maintained woodlands and savannas are important ecosystems for
   vertebrates in many regions of the world. These ecosystems are being
   restored by forest managers, but little information exists on
   herpetofaunal responses to this restoration in areas dominated by
   shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata). We compared habitat characteristics and
   herpetofaunal communities in restored pine woodlands to relatively
   unmanaged, second-growth forests in the Ouachita Mountains of western
   Arkansas, USA. We found woodland restoration with periodic burning
   affected species differently; some species benefited, some species
   appeared negatively affected, but most species did not respond clearly
   either way. Overall reptile captures were significantly (p = 0.041)
   greater in pine-woodlands than in unrestored forest; one species of
   snake and three species of lizards were captured more often in woodlands
   than unrestored forests. Among anurans, we found no significant
   difference in captures between woodlands and unrestored forests for any
   species. Among salamanders, we captured western slimy salamanders
   (Plethodon albagula) almost exclusively in unrestored forest, but
   captures of other species did not differ between the two treatments.
   Historically, the Ouachita region likely consisted of a mosaic that
   included both fire-maintained habitats (woodlands, savannas, and
   prairies) and areas of denser forest on mesic sites that were less
   likely to burn. Consequently, landscapes that retain both open woodlands
   and denser, less-intensely burned forest (in the form of unharvested
   greenbelts or separate stands) would likely promote and maintain a
   greater diversity of herpetofauna.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife response to natural disturbances such as fire is of
   conservation concern to managers, policy makers, and scientists, yet
   information is scant beyond a few well-studied groups (e.g., birds,
   small mammals). We examined the effects of wildfire severity on bats, a
   taxon of high conservation concern, at both the stand (<1 ha) and
   landscape scale in response to the 2002 McNally fire in the Sierra
   Nevada region of California, USA. One year after fire, we conducted
   surveys of echolocation activity at 14 survey locations, stratified in
   riparian and upland habitat, in mixed-conifer forest habitats spanning
   three levels of burn severity: unburned, moderate, and high. Bat
   activity in burned areas was either equivalent or higher than in
   unburned stands for all six phonic groups measured, with four groups
   having significantly greater activity in at least one burn severity
   level. Evidence of differentiation between fire severities was observed
   with some Myotis species having higher levels of activity in stands of
   high-severity burn. Larger-bodied bats, typically adapted to more open
   habitat, showed no response to fire. We found differential use of
   riparian and upland habitats among the phonic groups, yet no interaction

   damage in the landscape had no effect on activity of bats in unburned
   sites suggesting no landscape effect of fire on foraging site selection
   and emphasizing stand-scale conditions driving bat activity. Results
   from this fire in mixed-conifer forests of California suggest that bats
   are resilient to landscape-scale fire and that some species are

Abstract = {{Quantifying the impact of habitat disturbance on ecosystem function is
   critical to understanding and predicting the future of tropical forests.
   Many studies have examined post-disturbance changes in animal traits
   related to mutualistic interactions with plants, but the effect of
   disturbance on plant traits in diverse forests has received much less
   attention.
   Focusing on two study regions in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, we used a
   trait-based approach to examine how seed dispersal functionality within
   tropical plant communities changes across a landscape-scale gradient of
   human modification, including both regenerating secondary forests and
   primary forests disturbed by burning and selective logging.
   Surveys of 230 forest plots recorded 26,533 live stems from 846 tree
   species. Using herbarium material and literature, we compiled trait
   information for each tree species, focusing on dispersal mode and seed
   size.
   Disturbance reduced tree diversity and increased the proportion of lower
   wood density and small-seeded tree species in study plots. Disturbance
   also increased the proportion of stems with seeds that are ingested by
   animals and reduced those dispersed by other mechanisms (e.g. wind).
   Older secondary forests had functionally similar plant communities to
   the most heavily disturbed primary forests. Mean seed size and wood
   density per plot were positively correlated for plant species with seeds
   ingested by animals.
   Synthesis. Anthropogenic disturbance has major effects on the seed
   traits of tree communities, with implications for mutualistic
   interactions with animals. The important role of animal-mediated seed
   dispersal in disturbed and recovering forests highlights the need to
   avoid defaunation or promote faunal recovery. The changes in mean seed
   width suggest larger vertebrates hold especially important functional
   roles in these human-modified forests. Monitoring fruit and seed traits
   can provide a valuable indicator of ecosystem condition, emphasizing the
   importance of developing a comprehensive plant traits database for the
   Amazon and other biomes.}},

   Pinus radiata trees and from glades within pine forest where trees had
   failed to grow. Under P. radiata there were lower soil pH and
   exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Fe, while lower microbial C, N and P in the
   plantation confirmed other findings that P. radiata reduces C, N and P
   pools in mineral soil. Relatively small differences in microbial biomass
   C and P between tussock >25 and <14 years since burning suggest that
   burning has a lesser effect than P. radiata on these properties.
   Burning, however, affected biomass N. Numerical abundance of
   megascolecid earthworms was greatest in tussock-grassland and in glades;
   they were least abundant under P. radiata. However, the heaviest
   individual earthworms occurred under P. radiata and in glades. Indices
   suggest a less stable or more rapidly reproducing nematode fauna under
   P. radiata; nematode generic diversity was lowest under P. radiata.
   Although the four vegetation types affected soil properties in various
   ways, most properties under the P, radiata plantation were most
   different. The decline in microbial biomass C, N and P and the microbial
   C: organic C ratio under P. radiata suggest lower organic matter inputs
   into the soil, and as such could be regarded as a decline in ecological

   been investigated. Here we evaluated the effects of a widespread
   invasive grass on fire behaviour in eastern deciduous forests in the USA
   and the potential effects of fire and invasions on tree regeneration. We
   planted native trees into invaded and uninvaded forests, quantified fuel
   loads, then applied landscape-scale prescribed fires and no-burn
   controls, and measured fire behaviour and tree seedling and invasive
   plant performance. Our results show that fires in invaded habitats were
   significantly more intense, including higher fire temperatures, longer
   duration and higher flame heights, even though invasions did not alter
   total fuel loads. The invasion plus fire treatment suppressed native
   tree seedling survival by 54\% compared to invasions without fire, and
   invasions reduced natural tree recruitment by 66\%. We also show that
   invasive plant biomass did not change from one season to the next in
   plots where fire was applied, but invader biomass declined significantly
   in unburned reference plots, suggesting a positive invasive grass-fire
   feedback.Synthesis and applications. These findings demonstrate that
   fire-invasion interactions can have significant consequences for invaded
   temperate forest ecosystems by increasing fire intensity and reducing
   tree establishment while promoting invasive plant persistence. To
   encourage tree regeneration and slow invasive spread, we recommend that
   forest managers remove invasions prior to applying prescribed fires or
   avoid the use of fire in habitats invaded by non-native grasses.

Abstract = {{The importance of disturbance for regulating the structure and diversity
   of grassy ecosystems is widely recognized, but disturbance-mediated
   interactions between grassland composition and grassland resilience, and
   consequent implications for conservation management, are less well
   documented. We established replicated burning, mowing and
   (non-livestock) grazing regimes in two contrasting grassy woodland
   remnants in south-eastern Australia, and monitored the dynamics and
   resilience of the matrix-forming tussock grasses, Poa sieberiana (Poa)
   and Themeda australis (Themeda), over 12 years. Introduction of frequent
   burning to a Poa-dominated understorey in a rarely burnt woodland
   enhanced dominance by Themeda, and conversely, reduced fire frequency in
   a frequently burnt Themeda grassland substantially increased Poa
   abundance. Burning was potentially detrimental in the Poa-dominated
   woodland, but sward resilience (recovery after the 2002 burn) increased
   as Themeda increased with repeated burning. By contrast, the Themeda
   grassland was resilient to 4- and 8-yearly burning, but biennial burning
   led to poor resilience and high tussock mortality under drought
   conditions. Contrary to other mesic grasslands, cessation of burning had
   not caused sward collapse by 14 years post-fire despite high litter
   accumulation, potentially due to compensatory growth of Poa, lower site
   productivity and drought. Biennial mowing without slash removal was
   similar to 4-yearly burning in effects, while exclusion from kangaroo
   and rabbit grazing significantly increased sward biomass and contributed
   to increased Poa cover and inflorescence production. We conclude that
   functional complementarity associated with mixed dominants enhances
   resilience to variable disturbance regimes, and that below certain
   thresholds of abundance of each dominant, this resilience declines.
   Conservation management of Themeda-Poa ecosystems should thus aim to
   maintain an effective balance of these dominants.}},

   Most of the surviving E. ovata displayed extensive crown dieback, and
   appear likely to die in the near future. Many eucalypt seedlings which
   were planted into burnt and unburnt experimental plots in 1971 were
   still alive in 1996, but most were less than 0.5 m tall and suppressed
   by tall regrowth of A. littoralis and Acacia pycnantha Benth. In the
   continued absence of fire and other disturbances, it is predicted that
   A. littoralis will continue to dominate the reserve, leading to further
   declines in eucalypts. It appears unlikely that a single fire will
   prevent A. littoralis dominance, and frequent burning at short intervals
   may be required to reinstate an open woodland structure.}},

Abstract = {{In resource-limited environments patch development is a critical
   component of ecosystem function. Resource patches at both fine and broad
   scales are temporally dynamic, and the resources they provide change in
   response to broad-scale ecological disturbances such as fire. Here we
   consider temporal changes in perennial vegetation patches by measuring
   the fine-scale development of physical patch layers in response to a
   broad-scale abiotic process, fire. Until recently, such fundamental
   shifts in patch structure have, for the most part, been widely assumed
   and quantitatively ignored. Fundamental shifts in post-fire litter
   composition are important for predicting fire behaviour and may be
   useful in identifying the range of conditions or thresholds under which
   the arrangement of fuel components affects future fire behaviour. We
   describe the post-fire development of physical patch layers associated
   with two eucalypt mallee tree species (Eucalyptus dumosa and Eucalyptus
   socialis). We quantified tree, litter bed and canopy dimensions for
   sites with fire histories ranging from 4 to 42 years, focussing on the
   development of the sub-canopy litter bed. There were strong linear
   relationships between tree size and litter bed size with increasing time
   since last fire. After we accounted for tree and litter bed size, fire
   history still had a significant effect on the composition of the litter
   bed with sticks, seeds and fragments generally increasing and leaves
   generally decreasing with greater time since fire. There were no
   significant differences between the two tree species studied for any
   relationship with time since fire. Our results document the temporal,
   fine-scale changes in litter accumulation and composition following fire
   in a mallee woodland, indicating that substantial shifts in composition
   occur, likely affecting the flammability of the litter bed. More
   specifically, we have shed light on post-fire trends in litter
   accumulation, a fundamental component of patch development. This study
   provides us with a better understanding of fine-scale resource patch
   development, allowing us to predict shifts in resources at broader
   scales. By understanding how landscape modulators and their surrounding
   environment influence the development of patches, we are in a better
   position to predict how changes in these drivers are likely to affect
   ecosystem processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We defined patterns of habitat use and selection by female grizzly bears
   (Ursus arctos) in the Besa-Prophet watershed of northern British
   Columbia. We fitted 13 adult females with Geographic Positioning System
   (GPS) radio-collars and monitored them between 2001 and 2004. We
   examined patterns of habitat selection by grizzly bears relative to
   topographical attributes and 3 potential surrogates of food
   availability: land-cover class, vegetation biomass or quality (as
   measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and selection
   value for prey species themselves (moose {[}Alces alces], elk {[}Cervus
   elaphus], woodland caribou {[}Rangifer tarandus], Stone's sheep {[}Ovis
   dalli stonei]). Although vegetation biomass and quality, and selection
   values for prey were important in seasonal selection by some individual
   bears, land-cover class, elevation, aspect, and vegetation diversity
   most influenced patterns of habitat selection across grizzly bears,
   which rely on availability of plant foods and encounters with ungulate
   prey. Grizzly bears as a group avoided conifer stands and areas of low
   vegetation diversity, and selected for burned land-cover classes and
   high vegetation diversity across seasons. They also selected mid
   elevations from what was available within seasonal ranges. Quantifying
   relative use of different attributes helped place selection patterns
   within the context of the landscape. Grizzly bears used higher
   elevations (1,595 +/- 31m SE) in spring and lower elevations (1,436 +/-
   27 m) in fall; the range of average elevations used among individuals
   was highest (500 m) during the summer. During all seasons, grizzly bears
   most frequented aspects with high solar gain. Use was distributed across
   10 land-cover classes and depended on season. Management and
   conservation actions must maintain a diverse habitat matrix distributed
   across a large elevational gradient to ensure persistence of grizzly
   bears as levels of human access increase in the northern Rocky
   Mountains. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation values of `old-growth' forests in landscapes subject to
   repeated disturbance by fire or logging have received considerable
   conservation attention. However, little is known of the conservation
   values of old-growth sites in ecosystems with an evolutionary history of
   highly frequent disturbance. Here we address the value of low fire
   frequency (<1 fire/10 years) in tropical savannas, the world's most
   fire-prone biome, in terms of ant biodiversity. We do this by comparing
   savanna ant communities within the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP) near
   Darwin in the Australian monsoonal tropics, which has experienced a low
   incidence of fire over 25 years due to active fire exclusion, with those
   of adjacent (outside) sites experiencing the ambient fire regime of
   burning every 2-5 years. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and
   arboreal pitfall traps at 16 sites, eight each inside and outside TWP.
   More than 16 000 ants were recorded during the study, representing a
   total of 98 ant species from 30 genera. More species in total were
   recorded outside (90) than inside (74) TWP, but there was no difference
   in mean site species richness or abundance, and overall species
   composition was similar. All species recorded inside TWP are common and
   widespread throughout the savanna landscapes of the broader region, in
   the absence of active fire exclusion. Low fire frequency at the
   Territory Wildlife Park therefore does not appear to have enhanced
   regional ant conservation values. Our findings reinforce the importance
   of targeting fire regimes that are clearly linked to positive
   conservation outcomes, rather than assuming a need for maximum
   `pyrodiversity'.}},

Volume = {{207}},

Pages = {{586-598}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation mosaics of grassland/savanna and forest can be found in
   tropical and subtropical regions of the world, as in southern Brazil,
   where climate conditions are suitable for forest. Changes in intensity
   or frequency of disturbances could enable woody species encroachment in
   grassland communities; however, the processes are related to site
   conditions and life history of pioneer species. In this paper, we study
   transition patterns of forest to grassland in the absence of grazing,
   but under different site conditions related to aspect (landscape
   position) and time since the last burn. Data are based on shrub and tree
   species composition and soil variables at forest-grassland boundaries.
   We found 119 woody species of 42 families along transects of 27 m into
   the forest and 31.5 m into the grassland. Gradients from forest to
   grassland were analysed as compositional trajectories in ordination
   space and differences in the spatial patterns depicted between distinct
   site aspects. The time since the last fire did not influence these
   patterns. Inside the forest, tree species diversity was significantly
   higher close to the edge, independent of the density of individuals. Two
   main mechanisms may promote forest expansion into the grassland. First,
   a gradual tree encroachment near the edge and, second, a mechanism
   linked to the recruitment of isolated pioneer trees within the grassland
   matrix, most frequently near rocky outcrops, where a decrease in grass
   biomass leads to low-intensity fires. Despite vegetation patterns at
   boundaries differing according to aspect, the most important explanatory
   factor was the distance from the forest border, not just by itself, but
   with all correlated parameters that are changing along the gradient. (C)

Abstract = {{Logging in Tasmania's wet eucalypt forests has traditionally been based
   on a clearfell burn and sow regime, a process that has become
   increasingly controversial in recent years. The managing authority for
   these forests, Forestry Tasmania, has designed a Silvicultural Systems
   Trial in Tasmania's Southern Forests to explore alternative methods for
   harvesting and regenerating eucalypts. One of the components of this
   Trial is a study of lichens and bryophytes. Pre-logging surveys revealed
   a diverse flora comprising 134 lichen and 144 bryophyte taxa. Logging
   and regeneration produces a suite of new microhabitats for colonization
   by lichens and bryophytes. After three years, 51 lichens have been
   recorded in the plots. Twenty-eight were recorded in the unlogged
   forest, and represent recolonizers; lichen survivors after logging and
   regeneration treatment are very few. The remaining 23 lichens represent
   some transient weedy species as well as some that are typical of more
   open, drier conditions. A feature of the post-logging flora is the high
   proportion of species also found in the Northern Hemisphere.
   Re-establishment of the pre-logging flora is limited by habitat and will
   depend on the re-establishment of pre-logging habitats such as mature
   dominant trees and understorey trees and shrubs.}},

   highest rates of soil loss were observed in the logged area where mules
   were used for log removal. Soil moisture showed some differences between
   treatments during the first year after fire but then values were
   similar. Logging and particularly the use of skidders for log removal
   caused an initial increase in the amount of exposed bare ground but
   later when vegetation cover increased differences were minimized. The
   main woody species showed a species specific response to the treatments

   was not true for the respouters. In general, the growth and survival of

Abstract = {{Wild ungulate herbivory and prescribed fire can modify the vegetational
   characteristics of Populus forest plant communities and alter their
   potential to meet conservation objectives. Effective management of these
   areas depends on understanding the impact of these disturbances across
   natural landscapes. Our objective was to quantify various overstory and
   understory plant community characteristics in the Populus forests in and
   around Elk Island National Park, Alberta, under different disturbance
   regimes. Vegetation from 36 sites, stratified by four topographic
   positions and three historical treatment combinations of fire and native
   ungulate herbivory, were sampled. In these sites, we quantified tree
   density, basal area and cover, understory species richness and
   diversity, shrub density and height, as well as grass, forb, and browse
   annual net primary production (ANPP). Although tree canopy
   characteristics were similar under all three disturbances,
   small-diameter trees (<5 cm) were nearly absent within the Park. The
   reference area outside the Park had greater browse-leaf and -twig ANPP,
   as well as shrub height, but lower grass ANPP. Inside the Park, burned
   areas had greater shrub density and ANPP of grass and forb components.
   Topographically, tree stand basal area, cover, and shrub height were
   greatest on the northern slope, as was browse-leaf ANPP. Species
   diversity and richness were relatively greater on the toe slope. Within
   the plant community variables examined, the disturbances and positions
   frequently interacted, particularly the burned treatment with the crest
   position and level of herbivory with the south-facing and north-facing
   slopes. The structure, composition, and ANPP of Populus forest in Elk
   Island National Park has been significantly affected by both ungulate
   herbivory and prescribed burning. These factors, along with topography,
   influence the vegetation and are consequently important for management
   of the park's habitat and ungulate populations.}},

   Like many remnant longleaf pine forests, Berry College's stands have
   been fire-suppressed for decades. Since 2003, similar to 160 ha of the
   BCLPMA has been managed using prescribed burns and herbicide injection
   of hardwoods with the goal of achieving an open, pine-dominated canopy,
   low duff, litter, and downed woody fuels, increased groundcover
   vegetation, and improved longleaf pine recruitment. Canopy tree
   structure was quantified using the point-quarter method in eight managed
   and five unmanaged stands in 2004 and 2014. Understory vegetation and
   downed woody fuels were estimated in a subset of these stands in
   2003/2004 and 2015 using a plane-intercept method. Data from mountain
   longleaf pine stands in Alabama were included as external frequently
   burned and fire-suppressed references. Overall canopy and understory
   structure of managed stands has moved over time in the direction of
   frequently burned external reference stands. Longleaf pine basal area
   has been maintained and importance values have increased with management
   despite the loss of some canopy trees associated with duff smoldering
   after burning. Duff and litter levels have decreased substantially in
   managed stands, while understory plant cover (herbs, grasses, shrubs,
   vines, and small trees) has increased. Downed woody fuels, which have
   varied as a result of fire events, have generally dropped in managed
   stands, whereas longleaf pine recruitment has increased. Results show
   progress being made in restoring the vegetative structure to desired

Abstract = {{Chrea National Park, one of the 11 national parks in Algeria, is natural
   and diverse but under different pressures: urbanisation, fires caused by
   the high flux of visitors. Several ecological and systematic studies
   have been conducted on the Araneae, the most important epigeal fauna,
   but no attention was given to the anthropogenic parcels of the Park. To
   assess the effects of urbanisation and fires on the ecology of this
   fauna, spiders were collected monthly for 2 years, using `Pitfall' traps
   in three disturbed stations: burned, urbanised and reforested and three
   natural sites as control. In total, 1,476 specimens were sampled (19
   families, 42 genera and 68 species). Zodarion algericum was the dominant
   species (13.25\%), particularly in the burned station. Mann-Whitney U
   test showed a significant difference between urbanised and nonurbanised

   of habitats, with open gaps of different stages of succession. In
   addition, the reforestation of cedars without any agricultural practices
   has no negative effects on the Park. No loss of biodiversity was
   observed; this would encourage the restoration of the forest to protect
   its fauna and flora.}},

Title = {{High Precision Altimeter Demonstrates Simplification and Depression of
   Microtopography on Seismic Lines in Treed Peatlands}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Seismic lines are linear forest clearings used for oil and gas
   exploration. The mechanical opening of forests for these narrow (3-10
   meter) lines is believed to simplify microtopographic complexity and
   depress local topographic elevation. In treed peatlands, simplified
   microtopography limits tree regeneration by removing favourable
   microsites (hummocks) for tree recruitment and increasing the occurrence
   of flooding that reduces survival of tree seedlings. Little, however,
   has been done to quantify the microtopography of seismic lines and
   specifically the degree of alteration. Here, we measured microtopography
   at 102 treed peatland sites in northeast Alberta, Canada using a high
   precision hydrostatic altimeter (ZIPLEVEL PRO-2000) that measured
   variation in local topography of seismic lines and adjacent paired
   undisturbed forests. Sites were separated into four peatland ecosite
   types and the presence or absence of recent (<22 years) wildfires.
   Paired t-tests were used to compare microtopographic complexity and
   depression depth of seismic lines compared with adjacent forests.
   Microtopographic complexity on seismic lines was simplified by 20\%
   compared to adjacent stands with no significant change between recently
   burned and unburned sites, nor between ecosites. Not only were seismic
   lines simplified, but they were also depressed in elevation by an
   average of 8 cm compared to adjacent forests with some minor variation
   between ecosites observed, but again not with recent wildfires. Thus,
   simplification of microtopographic complexity and the creation of
   depressions can persist decades after initial disturbance with some
   differences between peatland ecosites, implying the need for
   ecosite-specific restoration of topographic complexity. The importance
   of microtopography for tree regeneration on seismic lines remains an
   important question for reforestation of these disturbances and thus
   long-term recovery of habitat for species dependent on undisturbed
   peatlands, including woodland caribou.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the biomass of dead wood can be substantial in tropical

   standing dead wood by fire, together with likely `fall-down rates',
   could offset a substantial proportion of recently estimated dead
   standing wood carbon sink. The potential for using existing allometric
   equations to ascribe biomass to the components of dead standing wood (
   trunks, branches, bark) on permanent monitoring plots is reviewed. Some
   valid generalisations can be recognised but a lack of standardisation in

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1479-1488}},

Abstract = {{Fire and herbivory are primary disturbances that often overlap and
   strongly influence plant community development, but it is unclear how
   herbivory changes in relation to variability in burn severity. With
   climate change expected to alter fire regimes globally there is a
   critical need to understand how heterogeneity in post-fire habitat
   conditions modifies plant-herbivore interactions. We examined herbivory
   patterns, growth responses and defense chemistry expression (phenolic
   glycoside, condensed tannins) of regenerating aspen Populus tremuloides
   that experienced variable burn severity in the 2010 Twitchell Canyon
   Fire, Utah, USA. Browse damage was approximately 60\% lower in moderate
   and high burn severity plots compared to low severity and unburned
   plots. Aspen regeneration density was 2.3 and 3.1 fold greater in high
   and moderate severity burn plots than in low severity and unburned
   plots. High burn severity stimulated photosynthesis, vertical growth and
   biomass accumulation. Defense chemistry expression responded dynamically
   over time depending on burn severity. From June to August, phenolic
   glycoside concentrations showed no significant change in unburned and
   low severity fire conditions but increased 79\% and 139\% in moderate
   and high severity burn environments. By the end of summer, condensed
   tannins increased six-fold in high severity burn plots, with increases
   of 50\% or less in the lower burn severity plots. Deer activity, as
   defined by pellet counts, was inversely related to fire severity and
   positively related to browse damage. Elk and cattle activity showed no
   significant relationship with browse activity. Greater light
   availability in higher severity burn environments appears to enhance
   tolerance and resistance of aspen against herbivory by increasing growth
   potential and defense chemistry expression of aspen. These results
   suggest that burn severity influences plant-herbivore interactions
   through bottom-up and top-down mechanisms, and that higher fire severity
   increases post-disturbance vegetation recruitment potential by
   increasing resilience to herbivory.}},

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{298-307}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The hydrologic effects of hillslope log debris dams were analyzed in
   areas of the Castejon Mountains (semiarid Ebro Basin, NE-Spain) affected
   by a wildfire. Four experimental sites showing differences in the soil
   composition (calcareous and gypseous) and the aspect of the steep slopes
   (north and south facing) were selected. All of the experimental sites
   were located along planar hillslopes, where Aleppo pine forest had
   burned in 2009, in the four sites per triplicate. Runoff and sediment
   yields were measured for two consecutive years (2012, 2013) after the
   construction of log dams on partially re-vegetated sites in 2011.
   In 2012, log dam installation significantly decreased soil erosion from
   8.51 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) to 0.76 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), with a log dam
   performance of approximately 90\% being obtained. Similarly, the log
   dams caused a significant reduction of runoff, from 6.9 to 33 mm
   year(-1), presenting a performance of 52\%. Both differences decreased
   one year later. Approximately 75\% of the soil loss from 2012 was
   collected in only one clean-out period, when rainfall was almost half of
   annual rainfall. The quality of the eroded sediments and water runoff
   was related to the composition of the Ah horizon. Log dams reduced soil
   erosion in three of the four sites tested during the first year.
   However, in the second year, only one site showed statistically
   significant differences, which was the site with the greatest amount of
   bare soil. These findings indicate that in semi-arid areas, post-fire
   active restoration measures are still active four years after a fire on
   south-facing slopes with poor soils and slow ground cover recovery. (C)

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize tree-based spatial
   patterning of soil properties and understory vegetation in frequently
   burned ({''}reference state{''}) and fire-suppressed longleaf pine
   forests; and (2) determine how restoration treatments affected
   patterning. To attain these objectives, we used an experimental
   manipulation of management types implemented 15 years ago in Florida. We
   randomly located six mature longleaf pine trees in one reference and
   four restoration treatments (i.e., burn, control, herbicide, and
   mechanical), for a total of 36 trees. In addition to the original
   treatments and as part of a monitoring program, all plots were subjected
   to several prescribed fires during these 15 years. Under each tree, we
   sampled mineral soil and understory vegetation at 1 m, 2 m, 3 m and 4 m
   (vegetation only) away from the tree. At these sites, soil carbon and
   nitrogen were higher near the trunk while graminoids, forbs and saw
   palmetto covers showed an opposite trend. Our results confirmed that
   longleaf pine trees affect the spatial patterning of soil and understory
   vegetation, and this patterning was mostly limited to the restoration
   sites. We suggest frequent burning as a probable cause for a lack of
   spatial structure in the ``reference state{''}. We attribute the
   presence of spatial patterning in the restoration sites to accumulation
   of organic materials near the base of mature trees.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites have been recognized as indicators for natural or man-induced
   environmental stress and perturbation. In this article, we investigated
   the role of two non-exclusive hypotheses on the response of helminths of
   wood mice to fire perturbation: 1) a reduction of the helminth
   infracommunity (species richness) in post-fire areas due to the temporal
   lack of worms with indirect (complex) life cycles linked to intermediate
   hosts that are more specialized than the final host, and 2) an increase
   of the abundance of helminths with direct (simple) life cycles as a
   response of increasing abundances of the final host, may be in stressful
   conditions linked to the post-fire recolonization process.
   We studied the helminth infracommunities of 97 wood mice in two recently
   burned plots (two years after the fire) and two control plots in
   Mediterranean forests of NE Spain. Species richness of helminths found
   in control plots (n = 14) was twice large than in burned ones (n = 7).
   Six helminth species were negatively affected by fire perturbation and
   were mainly or only found in unburned plots. Fire increased the
   homogeneity of helminth infracommunities, and burned plots were
   characterised by higher dominance, and higher parasitation intensity. We
   found a gradient of frequency of occurrence of helminth species
   according to life cycle complexity in burned areas, being more frequent
   monoxenous (66.6 \%), than diheteroxenous (33.3 \%) and triheteroxenous
   (0 \%), confirming the utility of helminths as bioindicators for
   ecosystem perturbations. Despite the short period studied, our results
   pointed out an increase in the abundance and prevalence of some direct
   life cycle helminths in early postfire stages, whereas indirect life
   cycle helminths were almost absent. A mismatch between the final host
   (that showed a fast recovery shortly after the fire), and the
   intermediate hosts (that showed slow recoveries shortly after the fire),
   was responsible for the loss of half of the helminth species.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},

Pages = {{121-129}},
Abstract = {{Context. Feral cats (Felis catus) are implicated in the ongoing decline
   of Australian mammals. New research from northern Australia suggests
   that predation risk from feral cats could be managed by manipulating
   fire regimes to increase grass cover.
   Aims. We investigate the role of fire history and hummock grass cover in
   the occurrence of feral cats and rare rodents, including the critically
   endangered central rock-rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus), in a mountain refuge
   in central Australia.
   Methods. We installed 76 camera stations across four sites in the West
   MacDonnell National Park and used occupancy modelling to evaluate the
   influence of recent fire (within 5 years), hummock grass cover and
   ruggedness on feral cat and rodent occupancy.
   Key results. Occupancy of the central rock-rat was positively associated
   with areas burnt within the past 5 years a relationship probably driven
   by increased food resources in early succession vegetation. In contrast,
   the desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor) was detected at locations with
   dense hummock grass that had remained unburnt over the same period.
   Feral cats were widespread across the study area, although our data
   suggest that they forage less frequently in areas with dense hummock
   grass cover.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that fire management and grass cover
   manipulation can be used as a tool for rodent conservation in this
   environment and potentially elsewhere in arid Australia.
   Implications. Creating food-rich patches within dense hummock grasslands
   may allow central rock-rats to increase occupancy while simultaneously
   affording them protection from predation. Landscape-scale wildfire
   resulting in a single post-fire vegetation age class is likely to be
   unfavourable for native rodents in this environment.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon release from thawing permafrost soils could significantly
   exacerbate global warming as the active-layer deepens, exposing more
   carbon to decay. Plant community and soil properties provide a major
   control on this by influencing the maximum depth of thaw each summer
   (active-layer thickness; ALT), but a quantitative understanding of the
   relative importance of plant and soil characteristics, and their
   interactions in determine ALTs, is currently lacking. To address this,
   we undertook an extensive survey of multiple vegetation and edaphic
   characteristics and ALTs across multiple plots in four field sites
   within boreal forest in the discontinuous permafrost zone (NWT, Canada).
   Our sites included mature black spruce, burned black spruce and paper
   birch, allowing us to determine vegetation and edaphic drivers that
   emerge as the most important and broadly applicable across these key
   vegetation and disturbance gradients, as well as providing insight into
   site-specific differences. Across sites, the most important vegetation
   characteristics limiting thaw (shallower ALTs) were tree leaf area index
   (LAI), moss layer thickness and understory LAI in that order. Thicker
   soil organic layers also reduced ALTs, though were less influential than
   moss thickness. Surface moisture (0-6cm) promoted increased ALTs,
   whereas deeper soil moisture (11-16cm) acted to modify the impact of the
   vegetation, in particular increasing the importance of understory or
   tree canopy shading in reducing thaw. These direct and indirect effects
   of moisture indicate that future changes in precipitation and
   evapotranspiration may have large influences on ALTs. Our work also
   suggests that forest fires cause greater ALTs by simultaneously
   decreasing multiple ecosystem characteristics which otherwise protect
   permafrost. Given that vegetation and edaphic characteristics have such
   clear and large influences on ALTs, our data provide a key benchmark
   against which to evaluate process models used to predict future impacts
   of climate warming on permafrost degradation and subsequent feedback to
   climate.}},

   understory plant communities and ecosystem structure}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{464}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{In the Midwestern United States, oak savannas have been reduced in area
   by at least 99\% since European settlement, mirroring global trends for
   savannas, grasslands, and shrublands. Most remaining patches are highly
   degraded following decades of fire suppression and other anthropogenic
   impacts, and subsequent tree and shrub encroachment. Yet, reintroducing
   fire alone may not be sufficient to restore these ecosystems on desired
   timelines and mechanical thinning may be an important step in the
   restoration process, to increase understory light and promote the ground
   layer community. However, it is unclear how plant community dynamics
   develop under burn-only compared to thin-and-burn restoration scenarios.
   We investigated the impacts of prescribed fire and mechanical tree
   thinning on ecosystem structure and plant community dynamics over eight
   years in an oak savanna restoration experiment in southern Michigan.
   Established in 2010, this experiment utilized 15 0.4-1.2-hectare
   treatment units receiving either repeated prescribed fire alone, a
   combination of repeated prescribed fire and mechanical thinning, or no
   management. We used this design to test how differences in management
   affect understory and overstory structure, specifically understory
   vegetative cover and light availability associated with canopy openness,
   and plant community dynamics, specifically ground layer plant species
   richness and composition. We found that, over eight years of
   restoration, the response of ecosystem structure and the plant community
   was greatest in units where mechanical thinning was combined with
   prescribed fire. Thinned and burned units had greater canopy openness,
   vegetative cover, and plant species richness. Plant species composition
   also diverged between managed and unmanaged units. Canopy openness
   increased rapidly, within two years of restoration, while vegetative
   cover increased more gradually, over five years, and increases in
   richness were less pronounced overall. Composition diverged initially
   between managed and unmanaged units and continued to shift throughout
   the study period. Some effects of management peaked after four years,
   but were transient by the end of the study. Additional management will
   be necessary to capitalize on the initial response to restoration toward
   an oak savanna ecosystem. We predict that additional thinning will
   further increase light availability and development of graminoid fuels
   and in combination with prescribed fires will continue to promote open
   canopy structure and a ground layer dominated by savanna-associated
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The introduced Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) has spread across
   the southeastern United States and is rapidly replacing native prairies
   with monospecific Sapium forests. Most attempts to control Sapium are
   only temporarily effective because of its large seed bank and ability to
   resprout from cut stumps. We performed a two-year field experiment to
   evaluate the effectiveness of using large shredding mowers to mulch live
   Sapium trees and restore Sapium-invaded prairies. We predicted that
   Sapium mulch would damp diurnal soil temperature fluctuations and
   suppress Sapium seed germination because Sapium seed germination is
   highly dependent upon those fluctuations. We manipulated mulch depths
   and types (0, 10, and 15 cm deep Sapium mulch and hardwood and straw
   mulch) in the field and measured soil temperatures beneath them. Diurnal
   soil temperature fluctuations were damped at depths as little as 5 cm,
   and Sapium mulch significantly reduced Sapium seedling emergence. Deep
   layers of Sapium mulch (15 cm) reduced seedling survival and native
   vegetation cover as well. Comparisons among Sapium mulch and alternative
   mulch materials revealed no allelopathic effects of Sapium mulch on
   Sapium seedling emergence, survival, or growth. Vigorous regrowth of
   native vegetation through 5 cm of Sapium mulch was evident by the end of
   the first growing season. With no trees or stumps remaining on the site,
   a mowing regime can be implemented immediately regardless of the
   pre-mulching density of the trees. A heavy closed-canopy Sapium forest
   might result in mulch depths that slow the return of native vegetation
   and delay accumulation of adequate fuel loads to support prescribed
   burning.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing frequency and severity of fire and drought events have
   negatively impacted the capacity and success of reforestation efforts in
   many dry, western U.S. forests. Challenges to reforestation include the
   cost and safety concerns of replanting large areas of standing dead
   trees, and high seedling and sapling mortality rates due to water
   stress, competing vegetation, and repeat fires that burn young
   plantations. Standard reforestation practices have emphasized
   establishing dense conifer cover with gridded planting, sometimes called
   `pines in lines', followed by shrub control and pre-commercial thinning.
   Resources for such intensive management are increasingly limited,
   reducing the capacity for young plantations to develop early resilience
   to fire and drought. This paper summarizes recent research on the
   conditions under which current standard reforestation practices in the
   western U.S. may need adjustment, and suggests how these practices might
   be modified to improve their success. In particular we examine where and
   when plantations with regular tree spacing elevate the risk of future
   mortality, and how planting density, spatial arrangement, and species
   composition might be modified to increase seedling and sapling survival
   through recurring drought and fire events. Within large areas of
   contiguous mortality, we suggest a ``three zone{''} approach to
   reforestation following a major disturbance that includes; (a) working
   with natural recruitment within a peripheral zone near live tree seed
   sources; (b) in a second zone, beyond effective seed dispersal range but
   in accessible areas, planting a combination of clustered and regularly
   spaced seedlings that varies with microsite water availability and
   potential fire behavior; and (c) a final zone defined by remote, steep
   terrain that in practice limits reforestation efforts to the
   establishment of founder stands. We also emphasize the early use of
   prescribed fire to build resilience in developing stands subject to
   increasingly common wildfires and drought events. Finally, we highlight
   limits to our current understanding of how young stands may respond and
   develop under these proposed planting and silvicultural practices, and
   identify areas where new research could help refine them.}},

Abstract = {{While transfers of formerly coppiced or grazed woodlands into shady high
   forests cause severe declines of woodland butterflies across Europe,
   increasing numbers of wild ungulates contribute to maintaining stand
   openness. To disentangle the relative effects of management and
   ungulates, we studied butterfly assemblages in the Milovicky Wood,
   southeastern Czech Republic. After centuries of short-rotation
   coppicing, the wood was abandoned in the 1950s and two game parks, for
   deer and mouflon, were established there in the 1960s. Comparisons of
   historical and recent records show severe declines, but the wood still
   hosts 83 butterfly and burnet species, including 19 nationally
   endangered ones. Recording along fixed transects disentangled effects of
   game keeping and management. Stands situated in the mouflon park hosted
   fewer species than those in either the deer park or outside of the
   parks. Clearings, coppice, coppice with standards and rides hosted more
   species than closed forest. The strongest predictors of composition of
   butterfly assemblages were plant communities and stand management,
   followed by vegetation covers, plant species richness and kind of game
   (mouflon, deer, none). Both game and management exhibited independent
   effects. Past high game densities contributed to butterfly losses, but
   have maintained open structures absent from woods managed for timber.
   Under reduced densities, mouflon exhibit adverse effects on butterflies
   but deer do not. Recent plans to transfer the area to high forest are
   incompatible with conserving local butterflies and incur high costs of
   forest protection against the animals. In contrast, re-establishment of
   active coppicing for fuel wood production would be optirrial for
   butterflies, compatible with game keeping. Finding a balance between
   game and traditional forms of management offers an opportunity for
   threatened biodiversity of European lowland forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-63}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Previous experiments on post-fire establishment of two obligate seeders
   and two resprouting species suggested that initial establishment
   processes differ between wet- and dry-heath habitats. Disturbance,
   interspecific competition between seedlings and between seedlings and
   adults, and access for potential predators were manipulated in the field
   after a fire to identify mechanisms to explain between- and
   within-habitat species coexistence. When soil surfaces are disturbed or
   seeds are buried, dry-heath species can establish in the wet heath.
   Under natural conditions, however, wet heath is rarely disturbed by
   animal foragers and lack of safe sites may preclude establishment of
   dry-heath species. In contrast, dry heath is often disturbed by ground
   foragers such as bandicoots and safe sites are plentiful for
   establishment of all heath species. Nevertheless, while wet-heath
   species can establish in dry heath, their seedlings are apparently
   unable to survive there due to the drier conditions. No evidence for
   competition among species was detected in either type of habitat during
   the first 3 years of the experiment, even at elevated seedling
   densities. Lack of early competition and unsaturated seed-banks may
   promote coexistence of species. Seedling predation from vertebrates was
   low and did not appear to influence patterns of coexistence within or
   between habitats. In terms of community theory we suggest that several
   interacting mechanisms are responsible for community structure in heaths
   after a fire. Chance and microsite disturbance are important during
   dispersal, while resources are critical during establishment and early
   survival of seedling populations. In these heath systems where fires
   burn extensive areas, seed-banks may be more important in temporal
   storage of species than patch or spatial storage as a mechanism for
   maintaining coexistence and plant diversity.}},

Title = {{Vegetation recovery in a desert landscape after wildfires: influences of
   community type, time since fire and contingency effects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1401-1410}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Theories of plant succession are poorly developed in arid lands,
   hindering our understanding of how long communities may take to recover
   after disturbances such as fire. In desert landscapes vulnerable to
   fire, information about vegetation recovery is important when deciding
   whether land managers should facilitate vegetation recovery. The deserts
   of the southwestern USA are increasingly subject to unprecedented fires,
   facilitated by fuel from exotic grasses, yet management strategies are
   unclear.
   2. We evaluated post-fire recovery patterns of perennial plant species
   richness and diversity, compared the rate and direction of succession
   between two major community types, and explored the relationship of time
   since fire (TSF) and other environmental factors with vegetation
   recovery. We sampled perennial plant communities and environmental
   variables (e.g. soil N) on 32 burns, ranging from 2 to 29 years TSF and
   each paired with their own unburned area, within a 1 8 million ha
   landscape in the Mojave Desert, USA.
   3. Species richness, diversity and composition exhibited different
   post-burn recovery patterns, and recovery rates differed between
   community types. Specifically, diversity in Coleogyne ramosissima
   communities was greater in burned than unburned areas, but diversity did
   not differ in Larrea tridentata communities. Species composition in
   Larrea communities exhibited trajectories that indicate convergence with
   unburned community composition after 19 years TSF. Conversely, burned
   and unburned Coleogyne communities lacked convergence irrespective of
   TSF. Environmental variables (e.g. soil texture and P) accounted for
   79-83\% of the variation in burned species composition, suggesting
   environmental characteristics in part control recovery patterns.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The results indicate that geographically
   similar vegetation types within the same landscape can have markedly
   different post-disturbance successional rates and trajectories.
   Furthermore, the persistence of fire effects varied depending on the
   community measure, with fire effects on species composition more
   long-lasting than the effects on species diversity. This work supports
   (i) the use of post-disturbance successional analyses for helping to
   prioritize management where it is most needed (e.g. communities not
   recovering naturally) and (ii) the need to assess whether persistent,
   early successional desert communities meet functional management
   objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The montane ecosystems of the Cascade Range have been subjected to
   repeated manipulation and active fire suppression for more than a
   century. This has resulted in changes in community structure that
   contribute to increased wildfire hazard and severity. Ongoing efforts to
   return these ecosystems to a state with intrinsic low fuel loads have
   received substantial attention in recent years; however, many ecological
   questions remain unanswered. This study addresses belowground impacts of
   restorative treatments. We report proximate effects of the application
   of prescribed fire (burn-only) and the combination of fire and
   mechanical thinning (thin + burn) on soil chemical and microbial
   parameters in treatment units of 10 ha each in the Klamath National
   Forest of northern California. Soil organic carbon (C) decreased and C:N
   (carbon: nitrogen) ratio increased as a result of fire in the burn-only
   treatment; however, no significant changes from pre-fire to post-fire
   were observed for thin + burn treatment plots. N mineralization rates
   did not change as a result of fire in either burn-only or thin + burn
   plots. Nitrification rates decreased as a result of fire in thin + burn
   units, but did not change significantly in the burn-only treatment.
   Total inorganic N increased from pre-fire to post-fire, with and without
   thinning. Activity of acid phosphatase, an indicator of overall
   microbial activity, was reduced by fire, both with and without thinning,
   whereas activity of chitinase was reduced by fire in thin + burn plots
   only. There were no significant changes in phenol oxidase activity as a
   result of fire, with or without thinning. This study demonstrates that
   fire has short-term effects on soil ecological properties, e.g., soil
   organic matter, N turnover and availability, and microbial function, and
   that the combination of mechanical thinning and fire may have different
   effects from fire alone.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines invasion of grasslands on Cape York Peninsula,
   Australia, by Melaleuca viridiflora and other woody species, and the
   role of storm-burning (lighting fires after the first wet season rains)
   in their maintenance. Trends in disturbance features, fuel
   characteristics, ground layer composition, and woody plants dynamics
   under combinations of withholding fire and storm-burning over a 3-year
   period were measured on 19 plots in three landscape settings. Population
   dynamics of M. viridiflora are described in detail and 20-year
   population projections based on transition matrices under different fire
   regimes generated. Numerous M. viridiflora suckers occurred within the
   grass layer, increasing each year regardless of fire regime, and were
   rapidly recruited to the canopy in the absence of fire. Storm-burning
   had little impact on fuel, ground layer or woody plant composition, but
   maintained open vegetation structure by substantially reducing
   recruitment of M. viridiflora suckers to the sapling layer, and by
   reducing the above-grass-layer abundance of several other invasive woody
   species. Population projections indicated that withholding fire for 20
   years could cause a sevenfold increase of M. viridiflora density on
   Ti-tree flats, and that annual to triennial storm-burning should be
   effective at maintaining a stable open vegetation structure. These
   findings argue against vegetation thickening being an inevitable
   consequence of climate change. We conclude that a fire regime that
   includes regular storm-burning can be effective for maintaining
   grasslands and grassy woodlands being invaded by M. viridiflora.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species interacting with fires pose a relatively unknown, but
   potentially serious, threat to the tropical forests of Hawaii. Fires may
   create conditions that facilitate species invasions, but the degree to
   which this occurs in different tropical plant communities has not been
   quantified. We documented the survival and establishment of plant
   species for 2 yr following 2003 wildfires in tropical moist and wet
   forest life zones in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. Fires were
   ignited by lava flows and burned across a steep environmental gradient
   encompassing two previously burned shrub-dominated communities and three
   Metrosideros polymorpha forest communities. Fires in all community types
   were stand replacing, where >95 percent of overstory trees were top
   killed. Over half (>57\%) of the trees survived via basal sprouting, but
   sprout growth differed among forest communities. Sprout growth (4250,000
   cm(3)) was greatest in the forest community where postfire understory
   cover was lowest presumably due to thick native Dicranopteris linearis
   fern litter that remained postfire. In contrast, M. polymorpha sprout
   growth was much slower (<100,000 cm(3)) in the two forest communities
   where there was rapid understory recovery of nonnative ferns Nephrolepis
   multiflora and invasive grassesPaspalum conjugatum. These results
   suggest that the rapid establishment of an invasive-dominated understory
   limited recovery of the overstory dominant M. polymorpha. In contrast to
   the three forest communities, there were few changes in vegetation
   composition in the shrubland communities. Nonnative species invasions
   coupled with repeated fires selectively eliminated fire-sensitive

Abstract = {{We examined how fire hazard was affected by prescribed burning and fuel

   Mediterranean fuel complexes managed by means of prescribed burning in
   limestone Provence (South-Eastern France) were studied, illustrating
   forest and woodland, garrigue and grassland situations. The coupled
   atmosphere-wildfire behaviour model FIRETEC was used to simulate fire
   behaviour (ROS, intensity) in these complex vegetations. The temporal
   threshold related to the effectiveness of prescribed burning in reducing
   the fire hazard was assessed from derivated fuel dynamics after
   treatment. The study showed that prescribed burning treatment was
   effective for the first two years in most of the Mediterranean plant
   communities analysed. Thereafter, all forests and shrublands were highly
   combustible with a fire line intensity of more than 5000 kW/m except for
   pine stands with or without oak (medium intensity of 2000 kW m(-1) 3
   years after treatment). Low fire line intensity (900 kW m(-1)) was
   obtained for grassland which was entirely treatment-independent since
   the resprouter hemicryptophyte, Brachypodium retusum, is highly
   resilient to fire. Fire behaviour was greatly affected by fuel load
   accumulation of Quercus ilex in woodland, and by standing necromass of
   Rosmannus officinalis in treated garrigue. Pure pine stands with shrub
   strata similar to garrigue showed a lower fire intensity due to wind
   speed decrease at ground level under tree canopy, underlining the

   attributes associated with occupancy also were associated with the
   abundances of those species. Values of environmental attributes that

Abstract = {{Stand dynamics in the boreal forest are driven by wildfire, and many

   saproxylic beetles representing 310 species. Saproxylic beetle
   assemblages collected immediately post-fire and post-harvest differed
   significantly; however, by 30 years post-disturbance beetle assemblages
   had begun to converge with some general similarities evident among
   stands that were 28-29 years old. Beetle catch and richness was not
   greatly affected after fire; however, immediately following stand
   harvest there was a spike in species richness and beetle catch followed
   by a significant decrease in both metrics in the 29 year old stands.
   Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination
   indicated that assemblages from stands regenerating 1-2 years after fire
   and harvest were dissimilar from those of the other stand ages, and that
   samples from the burned stands tended to be more variable in composition
   than those from the harvested stands until our last sample 29 years
   post-disturbance. Saproxylic beetle assemblages were dominated by
   mycophagous and predatory species, with different species represented in
   stands regenerating after fire and harvest. Although the saproxylic
   beetle fauna of the western Canadian boreal forest seems reasonably
   resilient to disturbance in the present landscape context, retention of
   large-diameter coarse woody material in a variety of decay classes and
   selective burning of some residual woody material should facilitate
   recolonization by saproxylic species by retaining important microhabitat
   features that are rarefied by harvest. Crown Copyright (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The soil arthropoda population of northern taiga was investigated in the
   primary pine forest which had not been subject to any fire for at least
   100 years and at two burnt sites of different opost-fire successions.
   The population of the primary nonburnt forest is represented by 54
   microarthropoda species. The mesofauna is composed almost exceptionally
   of spiders: 10 species of them were identified.
   The foliage underwood develops on young burnt sites; the soil is covered
   with thick mossy cushions, with spots of reedgrass. The density of
   collembolan and oribatid mite population there is about two times lower
   than in nonburnt pine forests; gamasid mites are absent. The
   microarthropoda population is represented by the species which are
   common in the surrounding primary pine forests. The mesofauna consists
   mainly of ground beetles, open-land predators, and myxophytophagans.
   Spiders are represented by some widespread mobile species of low
   density.
   A mixed forest with mossy-lichen cover is formed on old burnt sites (of
   an age of about 50 years). Diversity and density of microarthropoda
   increase reaching the values characteristic of the primary forest;
   however, the species composition and dominance are still different. The
   fraction of spiders in mesofauna increases. The ground beetle population
   is the most abundant and diverse.}},

   fire suppression and the physiological limitations imposed by the
   increasing dominance of competitors, especially red maple (Acer rubrum
   L.). We examined the physiological responses of red maple, chestnut oak
   (Quercus prinus L.) and scarlet oak (Q. coccinea Muenchh.) seedlings
   following a prescribed fire in an upland oak-pine forest in eastern
   Kentucky. Immediately following fire, seedlings on burned sites had
   significantly greater foliar concentrations of N, P K, and Mg than
   seedlings on unburned sites; this effect of treatment diminished over
   the first growing season. Seedlings on burned sites also demonstrated
   significantly higher photosynthetic potential and had greater relative
   growth rates of diameter and height through the second and third growing
   seasons post-fire. Among species, chestnut oak consistently had the
   greatest foliar concentrations of all nutrients, with red maple being
   intermediate and scarlet oak the lowest. Both oaks had significantly
   greater maximum photosynthesis than red maple, but there were no
   significant differences among species for diameter or height relative
   growth rates. Treatment by species interactions indicated that red maple
   seedlings were significantly taller than oaks on the burned site, while
   there were no differences in height among species on the unburned site.

Abstract = {{Nutrient mobility in strongly coupled surface water-groundwater systems
   is not well studied in fire dominated ecosystems. In 2008, the Hidden
   Fire in the Kaweah River basin in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA provided an
   unexpected opportunity to document how nutrient concentrations change
   post-fire in a karstic groundwater-surface water system. The results
   from 4 years of sampling and water quality data (2009-2012) suggest that
   nutrient byproducts from 94 Phos-Check D75 R fire retardant that was
   dropped to combat the fire were mobilized into the aquatic system.
   Dissolved nitrate concentrations sharply increased at most monitoring
   sites with the onset of winter precipitation and seasonal snowmelt in
   the spring of 2009, remained elevated during seasonal sampling at some
   sites in 2010, and were significantly lower in 2011 and 2012. Average
   nitrate concentrations in sub-basins during the 2009 high-discharge
   period are strongly correlated with the amount of retardant applied in
   each sub-basin, but not correlated with the sub-basin area. Dissolved
   phosphate concentrations were highest upstream of sink points where
   streams directly recharge marble karst aquifers, and decreased between
   recharge sites and springs; indicating organic and/or inorganic uptake
   of P in the subterranean system. Although measured nutrient
   concentrations were within the range documented post-fire in other
   aquatic systems that did not receive fire retardant, evidence from the
   Hidden Fire strongly suggests that fire retardant derived nutrients
   entered and flushed through the Yucca Creek system, and that managers
   should consider the potential impacts of retardant application on
   aquatic ecosystems even when retardant is not applied directly on
   waterways.}},

Abstract = {{Fire affects grassland composition by selectively influencing
   recruitment. Some exotic species can increase their abundance as a
   consequence of fire-stimulated seed germination, but response may depend
   on seed age. Rumex acetosella L. (Polygonaceae, sheep's sorrel) is a
   cosmopolitan herb that has invaded NW Patagonia's grasslands. This
   species forms persistent soil seed banks and increases after
   disturbances, particularly fire. We studied how fire and seed longevity
   influence R. acetosella germination. In 2008, we conducted laboratory
   experiments where we exposed different-aged seeds (up to 19 years old)
   to heat, smoke, charcoal, ash and control treatments. Total percentage
   germination and mean germination time depended on both seed age and fire
   treatment. Germination of younger seeds decreased with increasing
   temperature. There was no general pattern in germination responses of
   different-aged seeds to smoke, charcoal and ash. While smoke improved
   the germination of fresh seeds, charcoal decreased germination.
   Germination of untreated seeds was negatively correlated with seed age,
   and mean germination time increased with seed age. In most treatments,
   fresh seeds had lower germination than 1-5-year-old seeds, indicating an
   after-ripening requirement. Smoke stimulates R. acetosella germination,
   causing successful recruitment during post-fire conditions. Fresh seeds
   are particularly responsive to fire factors, possibly because they have
   not experienced physical degradation and are more receptive to
   environmental stimuli. Knowing the colonisation potential from the soil
   seed bank of this species during post-fire conditions will allow us to
   predict their impact on native communities.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fire greatly affects plant and animal biodiversity. There is an
   extensive body of literature on the effects of fire on insect
   communities, in which a large variability of responses has been
   observed. Very few studies, however, have addressed functional responses
   at the species level, information that would greatly enhance our
   understanding of the impact of fire at higher organisational levels.
   2. The aim of this study is to analyse the short-term ecological and
   behavioural responses of the Mediterranean ant Aphaenogaster gibbosa to
   fire-induced environmental changes. We compared aspects of the abiotic
   and biotic environment relevant to this species, as well as differences
   in colony foraging behaviour, on unburnt and burnt plots in a
   Mediterranean area that was affected by a wildfire.
   3. Our results showed that fire modified plant cover around nests and
   daily cycles of soil temperature close to the nest. Although there were
   no significant differences in food quantity, food quality (particularly
   seed composition) was different between unburnt and burnt plots.
   4. In accordance with these environmental changes, we found significant
   differences in the daily activity rhythms and diet composition of A.
   gibbosa between unburnt and burnt plots. Overall, these differences did
   not result in significant changes in overall foraging activity and
   efficiency, allowing ant colonies to maintain the same food intake
   regardless of the habitat they occupied.
   5. We conclude that A. gibbosa uses behavioural plasticity to modify its
   foraging strategy in recently burnt environments and thus survive
   post-fire conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Understanding the ecological role of fire in shaping plant

   and after burning in high-elevation montane grasslands dominated by C-3
   species receiving a mean annual precipitation of 545 mm. Location Valles
   Caldera National Preserve, Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, USA. Methods
   Long-term data (10 year pre-fire; 5 year post-fire) on plant community
   composition of nine burned and seven unburned grassland sites were used
   to determine the response of montane grasslands to a summer wildfire. We
   used multivariate and univariate analyses to determine changes in plant
   community composition and structure, pre- and post-wildfire on burned
   and unburned grasslands. Results The montane grassland community
   consisted of 155 plant taxa, including 44 perennial grasses, one annual
   grass, 92 perennial forbs and nine annual forbs. We found that these
   fire-adapted plant communities were highly resilient to fire; fire had
   no significant effects on composition or structure beyond the normal
   range of inter-annual variability. Instead, seasonal precipitation had
   the largest influence on plant community dynamics over time, with lower
   average plant canopy height and diversity during drought periods.
   Conclusion Our results show that fire has very limited effects on the

Abstract = {{Aims
   Variations in rates and length of flowering and fruiting not only affect
   the reproduction of a given plant species but also the behavior and
   reproduction of associated taxa. Flowering and fruiting variations may
   be influenced by herbivory, especially by large mammals. The aim of this
   study was to determine the effects of cattle browsing on the
   reproductive phenology of understory species in a subalpine post-fire
   Nothofagus forest in Patagonia.
   Methods
   The effects of herbivory on plant reproductive phenology were studied in
   a set of experimental exclosures (fenced plots) installed since 2001 in
   a post-fire N. pumilio forest, located in Nahuel Huapi National Park
   (NHNP), Argentina. We monitored the beginning and duration of each
   reproductive phenological stage: floral bud, open flower, immature fruit
   and mature fruit. We also counted the number of flowers, fruits, seeds
   and viable seeds of the dominant plants to assess whether browsing
   modifies temporal patterns of the flowering and fruiting periods.
   Important Findings
   Cattle reduced the total number of species flowering and fruiting and
   changed the reproductive phenology of some species. We found that
   palatable species seem to be negatively affected by browsing in terms of
   reduced fitness due to changes in flowering and fruiting periods. In
   contrast, cattle benefitted the reproduction of non-palatable species
   and could promote the invasion of shade-intolerant exotic forbs such as
   Cirsium vulgare. The effects of livestock reported in this study are
   important to understanding how browsing could alter native species
   establishment and possibly alter successional trajectories during
   recolonization after fire.}},

Abstract = {{Forest recovery may be influenced by several factors, of which fire is
   the most critical. However, the moderate- and long-term effects of fire
   on forest recovery are less researched in Northwest China. Thus, the
   effects of different forest recovery time after fire (1917 (served as
   the control), 1974, 1983 and 1995) and fire severities (low, moderate
   and high) on larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) forest were investigated in
   the Kanas National Nature Reserve (KNNR), Northwest China in 2017. This
   paper analyzed post-fire changes in stand density, total basal area
   (TBA), litter mass, soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nutrients (total
   nitrogen, total phosphorus and total potassium) with one-way analyses of
   variance. Results indicate that litter mass, TBA, SOC and soil nutrients
   increased with increasing recovery time after fire and decreasing fire
   severity, while the stand density showed an opposite response. The
   effects of fire disturbance on SOC and soil nutrients decreased with
   increasing soil depth. Moreover, we found that more than 43 a is needed
   to recover the litter mass, TBA, SOC and soil nutrients to the pre-fire
   level. In conclusion, high-severity fire caused the greatest variations
   in stand structure and soil of larch forest, and low-severity fire was
   more advantageous for post-fire forest stand structure and soil recovery
   in the KNNR. Therefore, low-severity fire can be an efficient management
   mean through reducing the accumulation of forest floor fuel of post-fire
   forests in the KNNR, Northwest China.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning has the potential to improve habitat for species that
   depend on pyric ecosystems or other early successional vegetation types.
   For species that occupy diverse plant communities over the extent of
   their range, response to disturbances such as fire might vary based on
   post-disturbance vegetation dynamics among plant communities. Although
   responses of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) to fire have been studied
   in conifer-dominated forests in northern parts of the species' range,
   there is a lack of information on snowshoe hare habitat use in
   fire-dependent communities in southern parts of their range. We used
   global positioning system (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF)
   radio-collars to monitor the habitat use of 32 snowshoe hares in a
   scrub-oak (Quercus ilicifolia)-pitch pine (Pinus rigida) barrens complex
   in northeastern Pennsylvania where prescribed fire has been used for
   habitat restoration. The area contained stands that underwent prescribed
   burning 1-6 years prior to our study. Also, we investigated fine-scale
   determinants of habitat use within stands. We found that regardless of
   season, hares did not select for areas that had been burned within 6
   years prior. Hares primarily used stands of older scrub oak, conifer, or
   hardwoods, which contained dense understory vegetation and canopy cover.
   Hare habitat use also was positively associated with stand edges. Our
   results suggest that hares do not respond to prescribed burning of scrub
   oak in the short-term. In addition, by focusing on structural
   determinants of habitat use, rather than broad-scale characteristics
   such as stand type, management strategies for snowshoe hares can be
   adapted over the extent of their range despite the multitude of

Title = {{Forest floor chemical transformations in a boreal forest fire and their
   correlations with temperature and heating duration}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{264}},
Pages = {{71-80}},

Abstract = {{Boreal soils account for similar to 30\% of the global soil organic
   carbon (C) stock. Wildfires are an important perturbation of this C
   pool, particularly affecting the top organic soil layer, which
   constitutes the forest floor. Alterations to the forest floor by fire
   are relevant to the soil C balance and have profound implications for
   soil properties. However, relationships between forest floor
   transformations and actual wildfire characteristics have not been
   established to date due to the logistical challenges of obtaining the
   necessary fire behaviour data, together with associated pre- and
   post-fire sample material. We used a high-intensity experimental
   wildfire to address this research gap, which enabled us to determine
   forest floor chemical transformations in a Canadian boreal forest in
   relation to temperature-time profiles for 18 sampling points during the
   fire. Forest floor samples taken pre- and post-fire were characterized
   using elemental and delta C-13 analysis, differential scanning
   calorimetry and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance.
   During this typical boreal crown fire average maximum temperature
   (T-max) at the forest floor was 745 degrees C (550 < T-max < 976 degrees
   C) with the average heating duration (t) >300 degrees C being 176 s (65
   < t < 364 s). Significant correlations were detected between the
   chemical characteristics of the pyrogenic (charred) forest floor layer
   and the temperature-time profiles at the corresponding sampling points.
   Higher T-max and associated prolonged heating durations correlated with
   greater C enrichments, increased thermal recalcitrance and degree of
   aromaticity of the pyrogenic organic matter. These changes were
   particularly pronounced for T-max > 600-700 degrees C, which is higher
   than the range of 300-500 degrees C for aromaticity development
   previously reported from laboratory experiments. One reason for this
   discrepancy could be the generally much longer heating durations used in
   laboratory studies, and we therefore advise caution when extrapolating
   findings from laboratory studies to wildfire conditions. Almost half of
   the initial total C stock in the forest floor (20 Mg C ha(-1)) was
   affected by fire, with similar to 24\% of this fire-affected C
   transformed to pyrogenic organic matter. This pyrogenic material
   possessed variable, yet distinct, chemical characteristics when compared
   to unburnt forest floor, including higher recalcitrance and associated
   resistance to biological degradation. As some boreal regions already
   show a rise in fire severity and area burned linked to climate change,
   our findings suggest a potential accompanying increase in the more
   stable organic carbon stock, with important implications for the
   functioning and turnover of organic matter in boreal soils. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Andosols are the most characteristic soils of volcanic regions such as
   the forested, fire-prone, hillslopes of the mountainous Canary Islands
   (Spain). Due to their volcanic nature, these soils have traditionally
   been considered highly resistant to water erosion processes in
   undisturbed conditions, but are also highly susceptible to environmental
   disturbances. In addition, volcanic terrains often underlie
   heavily-populated, steep areas where torrential rains are frequent,
   increasing the threat to the population and infrastructures down-slope.
   Numerous hydrological and erosional catastrophic events in disturbed
   Andosols in the Canary Islands and worldwide, leading to major losses to
   lives and properties, have been historically and recently reported. The
   impact of environmental alterations such as land use change on
   hydrological and erosional response of Andosols has been widely studied
   in the Canary Islands and worldwide. However, the effect on this soil
   type of wildfires, generally considered one of the main geomorphological
   agents, and historically connected to the forested fire-prone Andosols
   of the islands, has had scant attention to date. This review seeks to
   redress this knowledge gap by: (i) evaluating the factors affecting the
   susceptibility of Andosols to catastrophic hydrological and erosional
   events; (ii) summarizing the published studies on the impact of fire and
   the post-fire response of this soil type and the specific restoration
   measures developed to date; and (iii) identifying research gaps and
   suggesting new lines of investigation in order to reduce the
   hydrological and erosional risks in these particular terrains.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{439-448}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. The effects of prescribed fire on ant community structure were
   examined in a regenerating longleaf pine savanna in Florida, U.S.A. The
   presence of ants on 20, 10 x 10 m plots was determined by baiting every
   1-3 months from 18 months before a fire until 6 months afterwards.
   2. Expected species richness (based on rarefaction) and species density
   6 months post-fire were significantly lower than for the same month
   (September) 6 months before the fire.
   3. Cluster analysis revealed that the effects of fire were far less
   important predictors of ant community structure than seasonality and
   unexplained inter-annual variation. Thus, overall, the impacts of fire
   were relatively minor and short term at the community level.
   4. Different functional groups of ants (as defined by Andersen, 1997)
   responded to fire in strikingly different ways. Generalised Myrmicinae
   (e.g. Pheidole spp., Monomorium viride ) were affected more severely by
   fire than were the other functional groups. In contrast, the dominant
   Dolichoderinae (Forelius pruinosus ) exhibited a large increase after
   the fire and seemed to be responsible for the decline in abundance of
   several species.
   5. A strong negative correlation between F. pruinosus and other groups
   of ants immediately after the fire suggested more intense competition
   among ants at that time. Six months post-fire, the abundance of F.
   pruinosus decreased markedly and the abundance of other species
   rebounded.
   6. The rapid post-fire recovery of the ant community probably reflects
   adaptations of ants to a chronic fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the low timber productivity of Mediterranean Pinus halepensis
   Mill. forests in south-eastern Spain, they are a valuable carbon
   sequestration source which could be extended if young stands and
   understories were considered. We monitored changes in biomass storage of
   young Aleppo pine stands naturally regenerated after wildfires, with a
   diachronic approach from 5 to 16 years old, including pine and
   understory strata, at two different quality sites (dry and semiarid
   climates). At each site, we set 21 permanent plots and carried out
   different thinning intensities at two ages, 5 and 10 years after fires.
   We found similar post-fire regeneration capacity at both sites in terms
   of total above-ground biomass storage similar to 6 Mg ha(-1) (3 Mg
   ha(-1) of the above-ground pine biomass plus 3 Mg ha(-1) of the
   above-ground understory biomass), but with a contrasting pine layer
   structure. Generally, across the diachronic study, the earlier thinning
   reduced biomass stocks at both sites, except for the best quality site
   (the dry site), where the earliest thinning (applied at post-fire year
   5) enlarged carbon storage by 11 \% as compared to non-thinned plots. We
   found root:shoot ratios of an average 0.37 for the pine layer and 0.45
   for the understory layer. These results provided new information which
   not only furthers our understanding of carbon sequestration in low
   timber productivity Mediterranean forests, but will also help to develop
   new guidelines for sustainable management adapted to the high-risk
   terrestrial carbon losses of fire-prone areas.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is the major type of disturbance in forest and shrubland
   ecosystems in Galicia (NW Spain). Soil stabilization and rehabilitation
   techniques are frequently used to minimize the impact of fire on the
   ecosystems affected. However, information concerning the specific
   effects of these post-fire practices on soil microbiota is particularly
   scarce. In the present study we assessed the effect of an experimental
   fin of low severity, alone and combined with one of two post-fire
   stabilization treatments (seeding and mulching), on soil microbial
   communities in a shrubland area in the region. Measurements of soil
   microorganism biomass (microbial C determined by both the
   fumigation-extraction and the substrate induced respiration techniques),
   activity (respiration, beta-glucosidase, urease and phosphatase) and
   diversity (community level physiological profiles by Biolog Ecoplates)
   were made at different times (1, 90, 180 and 365 days) after the fire
   and application of the stabilization treatments, and compared with the
   same measurements made in the respective unburned control soil.
   Microbial biomass and activity were generally reduced by fire, whereas
   the microbial diversity was increased by fire. However, the fire-induced
   changes in microbial communities were relatively small compared with the
   marked temporal variations in the microbial parameters analyzed,
   suggesting that this type of fire does not substantially change the soil
   functioning. This response can be partly explained by the relatively low
   temperature that the soil reached during the experimental fire. Mulching
   and seeding treatments did not have any effect on biomass, activity and
   diversity of soil microorganisms. The implications of these results for
   management practices are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   investigate variations in nest survival related to treatment, year. and

   distance sampling methods to estimate small mammal density. Habitat
   characteristics were also quantified on each plot. Density of all
   cavity-nesting birds combined and of Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides
   villosus) in particular were higher on the control than the salvage
   treatment. Density of large trees and abundance of active cavities were
   higher on the control treatment. Nest cavities on the salvage treatment
   were most often located in non-logged watersheds. Nest survival
   estimates were uniformly high, with only marginal variations attributed

Abstract = {{Premise Resource availability affects biomass allocation in ways that
   could influence plant responses to disturbance such as fire. This is
   important because fire also varies across landscapes in ways that are
   correlated to resource availability. We hypothesized that plants growing
   in landscape microsites with a shortage of nutrients and water allocate
   more biomass and resources to belowground structures (and thus promote
   traits that enhance post-fire resprouting ability) than plants in more
   mesic sites. Methods We selected sites in three contrasting topographies
   (3 gullies, 3 midslopes, and 3 ridges) that supported different
   vegetation types and fire regimes, in Jalisco, Mexico. At each site, we
   measured soil nutrient and water content and light availability. Then we
   sampled biomass and root starch allocation in three post-fire
   resprouting shrubs that grow across a wide range of microenvironmental
   conditions. Results The ridges showed the highest values of solar
   radiation and the lowest of soil N and water content. Overall, we found
   a significant tendency for higher root-to-shoot (R/S) ratios, greater
   fine root biomass, and higher root starch content, in individuals
   growing in ridges or midslopes compared to the values of the plants
   living in gullies. Conclusions Plants located in open canopy sites,
   characterized by a shortage of nutrients and water, tend to allocate
   more biomass belowground than plants in wet and fertile sites. Thus,
   plants in wet and fertile forests should be more vulnerable to increased
   disturbance such as wildfires.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{431-442}},
Abstract = {{Mapping fire severity is necessary in order ( 1) to locate areas in need
   of special or intense post-fire management; ( 2) to allow the study of
   fire impact and vegetation recovery; and ( 3) to validate fire risk and
   fire behaviour models. The present study aimed to develop a method to
   map the severity of fire by employing post-fire IKONOS imagery. The
   objective was to develop an object-oriented model that would distinguish
   between different degrees of fire severity and to assess the accuracy of
   the model by employing field-collected data. The work comprised five
   main consecutive steps, namely, field data collection, data
   preprocessing, image segmentation, image classification and accuracy
   assessment. An adapted version of the FIREMON ( fire effects monitoring
   and inventory protocol) landscape assessment method was employed to
   quantitatively record fire severity in the field. As a result, two
   different datasets were used: one for training and developing the
   classification rules, and another one for assessing the accuracy of the
   classification. Separate and independent data were used for training and
   for accuracy assessment. Overall accuracy was estimated to be 83\%,
   while the Kappa Index of Agreement obtained was 0.74. The main source of
   inaccuracy was the inability of IKONOS to penetrate the dense canopy of
   unburned vegetation. The main conclusion drawn from the present work was
   that object-based classification applied to IKONOS imagery has the
   potential to produce accurate maps of fire severity, especially in the
   case of the open Mediterranean forest.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies showed that disturbances and water availability determine
   the richness among plants with different post-fire strategies of
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems. The aim of this study was to determine
   whether or not the scale of analysis has an influence on the effects of
   these factors and, therefore, on the segregation of the dominant
   post-fire strategies, obligate seeders and obligate resprouters, and
   facultative species. We recorded all woody species and geographical
   features on 94 (75 m(2)) plots of cork oak woodlands in the southern
   Iberian Peninsula. For each regenerative type (resprouters, seeders and
   species with both traits-facultative species), we tested the
   relationship between the number of species and the predictors using a
   generalised linear mixed model. The fixed predictor considered at the
   large scale was altitude, and fixed predictors considered at the local
   scale were aspect (north/south) and disturbance (fire and clearing by
   heavy machinery; yes/no). The random predictor was the factor of site.
   When this factor did not have significant effect for some regenerative
   types, these relationships was tested using a generalised linear model.
   Resprouting species were most represented at lower altitudes and in
   undisturbed sites, while seeders were also at lower altitudes but mostly
   on south-facing slopes, especially south-facing disturbed sites. For
   facultative species, site is the most important variable. The proportion
   of seeders from the total species is not related to altitude, but it is
   related to disturbance and aspect. These results suggest that there is
   no segregation of the richness of seeders and resprouters at the large
   scale (altitudinal gradient). Differences appeared at the local scale
   (aspect and disturbance).}},

Abstract = {{The principal ecosystem driver in arid Australia is unpredictable

   treatment had greater canopy cover and height. The bird community in the
   burnt 2002 treatment was characterised by granivores, whereas that in
   the burnt 1976 and long-unburnt treatments was characterised by foliar
   insectivores. All species showed monotonic responses to time-since-fire

   potential to influence the structure of soil microbial and faunal
   communities. However, little is known about how warming interacts with
   other ecosystem drivers, such as plant functional groups or changes
   associated with succession, to affect the soil community and thereby
   alter ecosystem functioning. We investigated how experimental warming
   and the removal of plant functional groups along a post-fire boreal
   forest successional gradient impacted soil microbial and nematode
   communities. Our results showed that warming altered soil microbial
   communities and favored bacterial-based microbial communities, but these
   effects were mediated by mosses and shrubs, and often varied with
   successional stage. Meanwhile, the nematode community was generally
   unaffected by warming and was positively affected by the presence of
   mosses and shrubs, with these effects mostly independent of successional
   stage. These results highlight that different groups of soil organisms
   may respond dissimilarly to interactions between warming and changes to
   plant functional groups, with likely consequences for ecosystem
   functioning that may vary with successional stage. Due to the ubiquitous
   presence of shrubs and mosses in boreal forests, the effects observed in
   this study are likely to be significant over a large proportion of the
   terrestrial land surface. Our results demonstrate that it is crucial to
   consider interactive effects between warming, plant functional groups,
   and successional stage when predicting soil community responses to
   global climate change in forested ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a key ecological process that can
   restore nitrogen (N) lost in wildfire and shape the pace and pattern of
   post-fire forest recovery. To date, there is limited information on how
   climate and soil fertility interact to influence different pathways of
   BNF in early forest succession. We studied asymbiotic (forest floor and
   soil) and symbiotic (the shrub Ceanothus integerrimus) BNF rates across
   six sites in the Klamath National Forest, California, USA. We used
   combined gradient and experimental phosphorus (P) fertilization studies
   to explore cross-site variation in BNF rates and then related these
   rates to abiotic and biotic variables. We estimate that our measured BNF
   rates 22 years after wildfire (6.1-12.1 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)) are unlikely
   to fully replace wildfire N losses. We found that asymbiotic BNF is P
   limited, although this is not the case for symbiotic BNF in Ceanothus.
   In contrast, Ceanothus BNF is largely driven by competition from other
   vegetation: in high-productivity sites with high potential
   evapotranspiration (Et), shrub biomass is suppressed as tree biomass
   increases. Because shrub biomass governed cross-site variation in
   Ceanothus BNF, this competitive interaction led to lower BNF in sites
   with high productivity and Et. Overall, these results suggest that the
   effects of nutrients play a larger role in driving asymbiotic than
   symbiotic fixation across our post-fire sites. However, because
   symbiotic BNF is 8-90x greater than asymbiotic BNF, it is interspecific
   plant competition that governs overall BNF inputs in these forests.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical forests vary substantially in aboveground properties such as
   canopy height, canopy structure, and plant species composition,
   corresponding to underlying variations in soils and geology. Forest
   properties are often difficult to detect and map in the field, however,
   due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of these forests. Spectral
   mixture analysis of Landsat imagery allows mapping of photosynthetic and
   nonphotosynthetic vegetation quantities (PV and NPV), corresponding to
   biophysical properties such as canopy openness, forest productivity, and
   disturbance. Spectral unmixing has been used for applications ranging
   from deforestation monitoring to identifying burn scars from past fires,
   but little is known about variations in PV and NPV in intact
   rainforests. Here we use spectral unmixing of Landsat imagery to map PV
   and NPV in northern Amazonia, and to test their relationship to soils
   and plant species composition. To do this we sampled 117 sites crossing
   a geological boundary in northwestern Amazonia for soil cation
   concentrations and plant species composition. We then used the Carnegie
   Landsat Analysis System to map PV and NPV for these sites from multiple
   dates of Landsat imagery. We found that soil cation concentrations and
   plant species composition consistently explain a majority of the
   variation in remotely sensed PV and NPV values. After combining PV and
   NPV into a single variable (PV-NPV), we determined that the influence of
   soil properties on canopy properties was inseparable from the influence
   of plant species composition. In all cases, patterns in PV and NPV
   corresponded to underlying geological patterns. Our findings suggest
   that geology and soils regulate canopy PV and NPV values in intact
   tropical forests, possibly through changes in plant species composition.}},

Abstract = {{To assess ongoing changes in high latitude vegetation productivity we

   trends of increasing tundra and decreasing boreal forest productivity
   has amplified in recent years, particularly in North America. Decreases
   in boreal forest productivity are most prominent in areas of denser tree
   cover and, particularly in Alaska, evergreen forest stands. On the North

   restricted to areas of higher shrub cover, which suggests enhanced

Abstract = {{Although the majority of fires in the western United States historically
   occurred during the late summer or early fall when fuels were dry and
   plants were dormant or nearly so, early-season prescribed burns are
   often ignited when fuels are still moist and plants are actively
   growing. The purpose of this study was to determine if burn season
   influences postfire vegetation recovery. Replicated early-season burn,
   late-season burn, and unburned control units were established in a mixed
   conifer forest, and understory vegetation was evaluated before and after
   treatment. Vegetation generally recovered rapidly after prescribed
   burning. However, late-season burns resulted in a temporary but
   significant drop in cover and a decline in species richness at the 1
   m(2) scale in the following year. For two of the several taxa that were
   negatively affected by burning, the reduction in frequency was greater
   after late-season than early-season burns. Early-season burns may have
   moderated the effect of fire by consuming less fuel and lessening the
   amount of soil heating. Our results suggest that, when burned under high

   differences in fire intensity and severity than to timing of the burn

Abstract = {{Fire-prone Mediterranean heathlands are biodiversity hotspots and home
   to a multitude of fire-dependent species. Fire-suppression policies
   worldwide have increased the risk of extinction of such species or have
   delegated relative prominence to other disturbances. This study explores
   how such a substitution of disturbances can alter the realized niche and
   population structure of a post-fire specialist. Using multimodel
   inference, we evaluate the relative magnitude and directionality
   (positive or negative) in the effect of large-scale (entire range) and
   local-scale (southern Spain) anthropogenic disturbances on the
   occurrence and abundance of Drosophyllum lusitanicum. This rare
   carnivorous plant is endemic to heathlands in the Southwestern Iberian
   Peninsula and northwestern Morocco managed under strict fire suppression
   policies. An increase in regional-scale anthropogenic disturbances did
   not affect regional-scale occurrence but significantly decreased
   abundance of Drosophyllum. On the other hand, local-scale anthropogenic
   disturbances positively affected both population occurrence and
   abundance. We demonstrate that non-fire anthropogenic disturbances can
   drive the population structure and distribution of an endemic post-fire
   specialist in Mediterranean heathlands, but their impacts change with
   their spatial scale. Although large-scale disturbances may threaten
   populations, small-scale disturbances may be more significant for
   species occurrence, and positively affect the distribution and
   abundances of pyrophytic species. In heathlands where fire suppression
   is a common practice, applying such disturbance regimes can be crucial
   for the preservation of fire-adapted Species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This literature review concerns insect responses to fire, compared to
   other feasible and appropriate conservation managements of open
   habitats. Many insect groups decline markedly immediately after fire,
   with the magnitude of reduction related to the degree of exposure to the
   flames and mobility of the insect. Niche diversity is lower in recently
   burned habitat, and the rate of insect increase following fire also
   relates to the species' ability to gain access to the regrowing
   vegetation. Postburn flora can be quite attractive to some recolonizing
   insects, possibly to some degree a result of fire-caused insect
   mortality which provides plants with short-term release from insect
   herbivory. Insect declines may follow immediately after mowing, but
   usually of lesser degree and shorter duration than after a fire of
   comparable timing and size. Season and scale of cutting may affect how
   much and which species showed positive or negative responses. Cut areas
   offer the vegetational structure and composition preferred by some
   insects, but cutting - or cutting at certain scales, seasons, or
   frequencies - may also be unfavorable for some species. Heavy grazing
   results in niche and assemblage simplification. Nonetheless, some
   invertebrates prefer the short turfs and bare ground resulting from
   heavier grazing. Other species vary in whether they peak in abundance
   and diversity in intermediate, light, or no grazing. In comparisons of
   mowing/haying and grazing regimes of similar compatibility with
   maintenance of the same habitat types, responses of particular species
   and species groups varied as to whether they had a preference for one or
   the other. Characteristics associated with insect responses to fire
   related to the degree of exposure to lethal temperature and stress
   experienced in the post-fire environment, suitability of post-treatment
   vegetation as habitat, and ability to rebuild numbers in the site (from
   survivors and/or colonizers). These factors appear equally useful for
   explicating insect responses to other managements such as haying,
   mowing, and grazing. By contrast, the assumption that the most
   habitat-restricted species will be most adapted to ecological forces
   believed to be prevalent in that ecosystem appears less efficacious for
   predicting insect management preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires often result in a series of biogeochemical processes that
   increase soil nitrate (NO3 (-)) concentrations for several years;
   however, the dynamic nature of inorganic nitrogen (N) cycling in the
   plant-microbe-soil complex makes it challenging to determine the direct
   causes of increased soil NO3 (-). We measured gross inorganic N
   transformation rates in mineral soils 2 years after wildfires in three
   central Idaho coniferous forests to determine the causes of the elevated
   soil NO3 (-). We also measured key factors that could affect the soil N
   processes, including temperature during soil incubation in situ, soil
   water content, pH and carbon (C) availability. We found no significant
   differences (P = 0.461) in gross nitrification rates between burned and
   control soils. However, microbial NO3 (-) uptake rates were
   significantly lower (P = 0.078) in burned than control soils. The
   reduced consumption of NO3 (-) caused slightly elevated NO3 (-)
   concentrations in the burned soils. C availability was positively
   correlated with microbial NO3 (-) uptake rates. Despite reduced
   microbial NO3 (-) uptake capacity in the burned soils, soil microbes
   were a strong enough N sink to maintain low soil NO3 (-) concentrations
   2 years post fire. Soil NH4 (+) concentrations between the treatments
   were not significantly different (P = 0.673). However, gross NH4 (+)
   production and microbial uptake rates in burned soils were significantly
   lower (P = 0.028 and 0.035, respectively) than in the controls, and
   these rates were positively correlated with C availability. Our results
   imply that C availability is an important factor regulating soil N
   cycling of coniferous forests in the region.}},

Abstract = {{There has been only one time-controlled study, in Canada, comparing the
   occurrence of bryophyte species in forests regenerating after wildfire
   with that in those regenerating after logging and regeneration burning.
   Previous work on vascular plants in Tasmanian tall open-forest dominated
   by Eucalyptus showed that filmy ferns were less common in areas that had
   been logged and regeneration burned than in areas burned by wildfire two
   decades after the events, which suggested that hygrophilous species,
   such as bryophytes, might be vulnerable to this silvicultural system.
   Bryophytes, vascular plants structural and environmental data were
   collected from 50 sites, which had been burned in wildfires or
   clearfelled and burned by prescribed fires 31-39 years previously.
   Eighteen percent of the vascular plant species for which it was possible
   to develop a multiple regression model had logging/wildfire as a
   component, whereas the equivalent figure for bryophytes was 17\%. The
   negative effects of logging were concentrated on the more hygrophilous
   species, and the positive effects were concentrated on the basal area of
   tree species and some of the mosses dependent on them. We conclude that
   wildfire and logging followed by regeneration burning result in
   vegetation differences that last more than three decades after
   disturbance, that these differences are no more pronounced for
   bryophytes than for vascular plants, and that hygrophilous taxa are
   favoured more by wildfire than logging. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Mechanical mastication is increasingly prescribed for wildfire
   mitigation, yet little is known about the ecological impacts of this
   fuels treatment. Mastication shreds trees into woodchips as an
   alternative to tree thinning and burning the resulting slash, which can
   create soil disturbances that favor exotic plants. Previous research on
   mastication has not simultaneously considered both the responses of soil
   organisms and understory plant communities. We compared mastication to
   slash pile burning (both 6-months and 2.5-years post-treatment) and
   untreated controls in pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus
   osteosperma) woodland and measured soil properties, arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and understory plant composition. Our results
   showed that slash pile burns had severely degraded soil properties and
   low AMIF abundance and richness compared to untreated or mastication
   plots. Pile burns were dominated by exotic plant species and had
   approximately 6x less understory plant abundance and richness than
   untreated plots. Only two variables differed between mastication and
   untreated plots 6-months post-treatment: mastication had lower soil
   temperature and higher soil moisture. Mastication plots 2.5-years
   post-treatment had more plant cover and richness than untreated plots or
   pile burns, although non-native Bromus tectorum cover was also greater
   and AMF spore richness was lower than untreated plots. The structural
   equation model (SEM) we developed showed that plant cover strongly
   influenced AMF abundance (0.50) and both plant cover (0.36) and AMF
   (0.31) positively influenced soil stability. In the short-term,
   mastication is a preferable method as it creates fewer disturbances than
   pile burning; however long-term impacts of mastication need further
   study as this practice could affect native plant communities. Our
   results suggest that the manner in which woody debris is treated
   following tree thinning has an important influence on soil stability and
   native plant biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   and/or frequency of fire on tropical forest and/or savanna vegetation
   structure over one decade or more. The initial control treatment' in
   many such cases consisted of previously cleared land. This is as opposed
   to natural vegetation subject to some sort of endogenous fire regime
   before the imposition of fire treatments. Effects of fire on fractional
   foliar cover are up to 10-fold greater when clearing pre-treatments are
   imposed. Moreover, because many of the classic' fire trials were
   initialised with applied management questions in mind, most have also
   used burning regimes much more frequent and/or severe than those
   occurring in the absence of human activity. Once these factors are taken
   into account, our modelling analysis shows that nonanthropogenic fire
   regimes serve to reduce canopy vegetative cover to a much lower extent
   than has previously been argued to be the case. These results call into
   question the notion that fire effects on tropical vegetation can be of a
   sufficient magnitude to maintain open-type savanna ecosystems under
   climatic/soil regimes otherwise sufficient to give rise to a more
   luxurious forest-type vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{The discontinuous permafrost zone is one of the world's most sensitive
   areas to climate change. Alaskan boreal forest is underlain by
   discontinuous permafrost, and wildfires are one of the most influential
   agents negatively impacting the condition of permafrost in the arctic
   region. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) of
   Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images, we mapped extensive permafrost
   degradation over interior Alaskan boreal forest in Yukon Flats, induced
   by the 2009 Big Creek wildfire. Our analyses showed that fire-induced
   permafrost degradation in the second post-fire thawing season
   contributed up to 20 cm of ground surface subsidence. We generated
   post-fire deformation time series and introduced a model that exploited
   the deformation time series to estimate fire-induced permafrost
   degradation and changes in active layer thickness. The model showed a
   wildfire-induced increase of up to 80 cm in active layer thickness in
   the second post-fire year due to pore-ice permafrost thawing. The model
   also showed up to 15 cm of permafrost degradation due to excess-ice
   thawing with little or no increase in active layer thickness. The
   uncertainties of the estimated change in active layer thickness and the
   thickness of thawed excess ice permafrost are 27.77 and 1.50 cm,
   respectively. Our results demonstrate that InSAR-derived deformation
   measurements along with physics models are capable of quantifying
   fire-induced permafrost degradation in Alaskan boreal forests underlain
   by discontinuous permafrost. Our results also have illustrated that
   fire-induced increase of active layer thickness and excess ice thawing
   contributed to ground surface subsidence.}},

Abstract = {{In large areas of the and western United States, much of which are
   federally managed, fire frequencies and associated management costs are
   escalating as flammable, invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) increases
   its stronghold. Cheatgrass invasion and the subsequent increase in fire
   frequency result in the loss of native vegetation, less predictable
   forage availability for livestock and wildlife, and increased costs and
   risk associated with firefighting. Revegetation following fire on land
   that is partially invaded by cheatgrass can reduce both the dominance of
   cheatgrass and its associated high fire rate. Thus restoration can be
   viewed as an investment in fire-prevention and, if native seed is used,
   an investment in maintaining native vegetation on the landscape. Here we
   develop and employ a Markov model of vegetation dynamics for the
   sagebrush steppe ecosystem to predict vegetation change and management
   costs under different intensities and types of post-fire revegetation.
   We use the results to estimate the minimum total cost curves for
   maintaining native vegetation on the landscape and for preventing
   cheatgrass dominance. Our results show that across a variety of model
   parameter possibilities, increased investment in post-fire revegetation
   reduces long-term fire management costs by more than enough to offset
   the costs of revegetation. These results support that a policy of
   intensive post-fire revegetation will reduce long-term management costs
   for this ecosystem, in addition to providing environmental benefits.
   This information may help justify costs associated with revegetation and
   raise the priority of restoration in federal land budgets. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Oak-dominated ecosystems throughout the central hardwood region (CHR)
   are experiencing a shift in species composition toward more mesic and/or
   fire-sensitive species such as red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple
   (Acer saccharum), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Prescribed fire can
   enhance oak regeneration but few studies have examined the effects of
   fire on other ecosystem components, including understory vegetation. In
   1994, a multi-disciplinary project was initiated to study the use of
   prescribed fire as a restoration tool in mixed oak ecosystems in
   southern Ohio. Here, I report on the response of understory vegetation
   after 3 years of early spring (dormant-season) fires. Each year, from
   1995 to 1998, species' frequencies were recorded in 1,728 2m(2) quadrats
   in four 75 to 100 ha study areas. Each study area included a control,
   infrequently burned (1X), and frequently burned (3X) unit. In all, 428
   vascular plant species were identified. Surface fires have altered the
   understory environment by greatly reducing the quantity of leaf litter
   on the forest floor, but light availability has increased only slightly
   as the tree canopy has remained closed. Several groups of species have
   responded consistently to fire, including seed bank increasers, tree
   seedlings, and spring monocots. On control plots, few species have
   increased or decreased in frequency by more than 5 percent. On 1X plots,
   18 species have increased and 5 have decreased; on the 3X plots, 22
   species have increased and 18 have decreased in frequency. From 1995 to
   1998, species richness (nearly all native species) increased on the
   burned plots relative to the control plots. This was particularly true
   at the quadrat level, where richness has decreased slightly on the
   control plots but increased by 11.4 and 10.4 percent on 1X and 3X plots,
   respectively. From our research in Ohio and from other studies in the
   CHR, we conclude that dormant-season prescribed fire may be used to
   promote oak and pine regeneration while maintaining or increasing the
   diversity of native understory species.}},

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{235}},
Pages = {{74-82}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fire is one of the most important natural disturbances in the boreal
   forest. It strongly influences boreal forest structure and function, and
   alters microbial biomass and species composition e.g. by significantly
   reducing the abundance of decomposing fungi. We measured carbon stocks
   and estimated fungal biomass and soil carbon turnover in Pinus
   sylvestris stands on a fire chronosequence from 2 to 152 years
   post-fire. Results show that the turnover time of soil carbon was
   longest in the area where fire occurred 2 years ago (117 years) and
   approximately two times shorter (ca. 60 years) in the areas where fire
   occurred 42,60 and 152 years ago. The soil carbon turnover time in our
   study areas was associated with very slow fungal biomass recovery. The
   fungal biomass (ergosterol content), soil carbon content and soil CO2
   efflux reached the same levels as in the oldest site approximately 60
   years after the fire. Our results indicate that the slow multi-decadal
   post-fire recovery of fungal biomass drives the soil carbon balance of
   boreal forests, and disturbances such as fires have a profound influence
   on soil carbon turnover for decades. On the other hand, the longer
   post-fire residence time of carbon in the soil compared to older forests
   suggests that fire effects on the soil carbon pool in boreal forests
   might be less dramatic than previously thought. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This before-and-after-impact study uses the natural abundance N isotope
   ratio (delta N-15) to investigate the effects of a wildfire on
   sub-alpine ecosystem properties and processes. We measured the N-15
   signatures of soil, charred organic material, ash and foliage in three
   sub-alpine plant communities (grassland, heathland and woodland) in
   south-eastern Australia. Surface bulk soil was temporarily enriched in
   N-15 immediately after wildfire compared to charred organic material and
   ash in all plant communities. We associated the enrichment of bulk soil
   with fractionation of N during combustion and volatilization of N, a
   process that also explains the sequential enrichment of N-15 of unburnt
   leaves > ash > charred organic material in relation to duration and
   intensity of heating. The rapid decline in N-15 of bulk soil to pre-fire
   values indicates that depleted ash, containing considerable amounts of
   total N, was readily incorporated into the soil. Foliar delta N-15 also
   increased with values peaking 1 year post-fire. Foliar enrichment was
   foremost coupled with the release of enriched NH4 (+) into the soil
   owing to isotopic discrimination during volatilization of soluble N and
   combustion of organic material. The mode of post-fire regeneration
   influenced foliar N-15 enrichment in two species indicating use of
   different sources of N following fire. The use of natural abundance of
   N-15 in soil, ash and foliage as a means of tracing transformation of N
   during wildfire has established the importance of combustion products as
   an important, albeit temporary source of inorganic N for plants
   regenerating after wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion is one of the primary land management concerns following
   wildfire. This study examines controls on post-fire hillslope-scale
   erosion for the 2012 High Park Fire in northern Colorado, develops
   simple empirical models for predicting post-fire sediment yields, and
   evaluates model performance on several nearby fires. From 2013 to 2015
   we collected ground cover, rainfall, topographic, and sediment yield
   measurements from 29 convergent hillslopes; eight of these hillslopes
   had varying amounts of mulch applied to reduce erosion. From these data
   we examined correlations between annual sediment yield and three
   categories of predictor variables (ground cover, precipitation, and
   topography). Percent bare soil was the single largest control on
   sediment yield, followed by rainfall variables. Sediment yield generally
   decreased with flow path length, but the correlation was weak. The
   empirical models each predicted sediment yield with three variables:
   percent bare soil, one precipitation variable, and one topographic
   variable. The models had similar accuracy for the High Park Fire using
   varying combinations of precipitation and topographic variables
   (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients 0.70-0.84). An empirical model predicting
   annual sediment yields as a function of percent bare soil, June October
   precipitation, and the maximum flow path length had variable performance
   when applied to other fires in the same region, with predictions ranging
   from poor to good for individual fires and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients
   of 0.26-0.32 for all fires combined. These tests show some promise for
   applying the empirical model to fires in the study region, but further
   model testing is needed to determine the range of conditions under which
   the model can be applied.}},

Abstract = {{In a glasshouse experiment, we used the shrub Grevillea speciosa to

   the distance from the soil surface to the junction of the swollen
   hypocotyl with the radicle. We then examined the applicability of the
   technique in the field by using post-fire seedling emergence. We found
   that the mean length of the swollen hypocotyl in seedlings was a good
   predictor of the depth of seed burial (R-2 = 0.97). Most variation
   occurred for seeds buried near the surface at 2-cm depth, where the
   swollen hypocotyl overestimated the depth of seed burial by about 1 cm.
   There was a decline in the ability of seeds to successfully emerge from
   soil depths below 2 cm, with seedlings of G. speciosa able to emerge
   from soil depths up to 8 cm in the glasshouse. This corresponds with the
   estimated maximum emergence depth based on seed mass. In the field,
   seedlings were estimated to have emerged from depths of 1-7 cm after an
   intense wild. re. There was an approximately normal distribution of
   seedling emergence depths; however, the mode of this distribution varied
   among locations. The technique gave comparable results to a similar
   technique developed for Acacia spp., allowing consideration of a greater
   range of species and post-fire locations. Use of the technique has the
   potential to provide insights into the impacts of. res below ground,
   including the nature of post-fire germination, residual soil seed banks,
   the depth-related action of fire-induced germination cues and

Abstract = {{1 Survival, resprouting and growth dynamics of the clonal shrub Andira
   legalis were studied for 2 years after fire, on a sandy spit on the
   coastal plain of Brazil. We examined the importance of resprouting for
   post-fire persistence, the relationship between resprouting patterns and
   injury suffered and size of individuals, and whether ramet growth was
   determined by competition and self-thinning.
   2 Post-fire resprouting was responsible for production of new ramets and
   led to an increase in the mean number of ramets per A. legalis
   individual.
   3 There was a negative association between resprouting from overground
   vs. underground. Highly injured individuals showed a significant
   tendency to sprout new ramets from underground organs whereas less
   damaged plants produced new branches and leaves from stem buds. Ramet
   production was related to an individual's prefire size (basal area), but
   to a lesser extent than to injury.
   4 Immediately after fire, the G(t,x) function (mean of absolute growth
   rates of shoots of size x at time f) was size-independent, suggesting an
   absence of competition. G(t,x) then became size-dependent, while D(t,x)
   (variance of absolute growth rates of shoots of size x at time t)
   remained size-independent, indicating that any competition between
   ramets was symmetric.
   5 Size-dependent mortality and a negative linear relationship between
   mean ramet size and density indicated self-thinning. However, the low
   ramet mortality (7.7\%) and the absence of size hierarchies
   (coefficients of variation remained constant) suggest that competition
   and self-thinning were not intense.}},

Abstract = {{The nurse-plant syndrome is a widely recognized example of positive
   (facilitative) influences of plant species on the establishment and
   growth of other species. Most studies of the nurse-plant syndrome have
   been on species that reproduce mainly from seed rather than
   vegetatively. In this study, we experimentally compared the influences
   of two species of nurse shrubs, Schinus patagonicus and Berberis
   buxifolia, on the survival and growth of vegetatively reproducing
   herbaceous and woody plants in a post-fire shrubland in northern
   Patagonia, Argentina. The vegetation beneath shrubs was removed by
   clipping and, in a paired-sample design, one half of the canopy of each
   shrub was removed. We determined species richness, counted number of
   resprouts, and measured photon flux density and soil moisture beneath
   cut and uncut halves of each shrubs.
   Abundances of resprouts were several times greater beneath the uncut vs,
   the cut shrubs, as was the mean number of species. Thus, shrubs have a
   strong facilitating influence as measured by resprout densities and the
   number of species. Numbers of resprouts and of species were twice as
   high beneath Schinus as beneath Berberis, implying important differences
   in the facilitative effects of the two shrubs species. Microsites
   beneath Schinus were characterized by lower and more heterogeneous light
   levels but by greater soil moisture. Even though the reproductive mode
   in this post-fire shrubland is overwhelmingly vegetative, facilitation
   by nurse shrubs is important and differentially effective for different

Title = {{Rapid Shifts in Soil Nutrients and Decomposition Enzyme Activity in
   Early Succession Following Forest Fire}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{While past research has studied forest succession on decadal timescales,
   ecosystem responses to rapid shifts in nutrient dynamics within the
   first months to years of succession after fire (e.g., carbon (C)
   burn-off, a pulse in inorganic nitrogen (N), accumulation of organic
   matter, etc.) have been less well documented. This work reveals how
   rapid shifts in nutrient availability associated with fire disturbance
   may drive changes in soil enzyme activity on short timescales in forest
   secondary succession. In this study, we evaluate soil chemistry and
   decomposition extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) across time to
   determine whether rapid shifts in nutrient availability (1-29 months
   after fire) might control microbial enzyme activity. We found that, with
   advancing succession, soil nutrients correlate with C-targeting
   beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) EEA four months after the fire, and with
   N-targeting beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) EEA at 29 months
   after the fire, indicating shifting nutrient limitation and
   decomposition dynamics. We also observed increases in BG: NAG ratios
   over 29 months in these recently burned soils, suggesting relative
   increases in microbial activity around C-cycling and C-acquisition.
   These successional dynamics were unique from seasonal changes we
   observed in unburned, forested reference soils. Our work demonstrates
   how EEA may shift even within the first months to years of ecosystem
   succession alongside common patterns of post-fire nutrient availability.
   Thus, this work emphasizes that nutrient dynamics in the earliest stages
   of forest secondary succession are important for understanding rates of
   C and N cycling and ecosystem development.}},

   after severe wildfire and can pose challenges to drinking water
   facilities by straining treatment response capacities, increasing
   operating costs, and jeopardizing their ability to supply consumers.
   Identifying source watersheds that are dangerously exposed to
   post-wildfire hydrologic changes is important for protecting community
   drinking-water supplies from contamination risks that may lead to
   service disruptions. This study presents a spatial index of watershed
   exposure to wildfires in the province of Alberta, Canada, where growing
   water demands coupled with increasing fire activity threaten municipal
   drinking-water supplies. Using a multi-criteria analysis design, we
   integrated information regarding provincial forest cover, fire danger,
   source water volume, source-water origin (i.e., forested/un-forested),
   and population served. We found that (1) >2/3 of the population of the
   province relies on drinking-water supplies originating in forested
   watersheds, (2) forest cover is the most important variable controlling
   final exposure scores, and (3) watersheds supplying small drinking water
   treatment plants are particularly exposed, especially in central
   Alberta. The index can help regional authorities prioritize the
   allocation of risk management resources to mitigate adverse impacts from
   wildfire. The flexible design of this tool readily allows its deployment
   at larger national and continental scales to inform broader water
   security frameworks.}},

Title = {{Fire severity effects on resprouting of subtropical dune thicket of the
   Cape Floristic Region}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{It has been hypothesised that high-intensity fires prevent
   fire-dependent fynbos from being replaced by fire-avoiding subtropical
   thicket on dune landscapes of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). Recent
   extensive fires provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis. We
   posit that (1) fire-related thicket shrub mortality would be size
   dependent, with smaller individuals suffering higher mortality than
   larger ones; and (2) that survival and resprouting vigour of thicket
   shrubs would be negatively correlated with fire severity. We assessed
   survival and resprouting vigour post-fire in relation to fire severity
   and pre-fire shrub size at two dune landscapes in the CFR. Fire severity
   was scored at the base of the shrub and categorised into four levels.
   Pre-fire size was quantified as an index of lignotuber diameter and stem
   count of each shrub. Resprouting vigour consisted of two variables;
   resprouting shoot count and resprouting canopy volume. A total of 29
   species were surveyed. Post-fire survival of thicket was high (83-85\%).
   We found that smaller shrubs did have a lower probability of post-fire
   survival than larger individuals but could detect no consistent
   relationship between shrub mortality and fire severity. Fire severity
   had a positive effect on resprouting shoot count but a variable effect
   on resprouting volume. Pre-fire size was positively related to survival
   and both measures of resprouting vigour. We conclude that thicket is
   resilient to high-severity fires but may be vulnerable to frequent
   fires. Prescribed high-intensity fires in dune landscapes are unlikely
   to reduce the extent of thicket and promote fynbos expansion.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of a wildfire and subsequent rainfall event in 2013 in the
   Warrumbungle National Park in New South Wales, Australia were examined
   in a project designed to provide information on post-fire recovery
   expectations and options to land managers. A coherent suite of
   sub-projects was implemented, including soil mapping, and studies on
   soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N), erosion rates, groundcover
   recovery and stream responses. It was found that the loss of SOC and N
   increased with fire severity, with the greatest losses from severely
   burnt sandstone ridges. Approximately 2.4 million t of SOC and similar
   to 74,000 t of N were lost from soil to a depth of 10 cm across the
   56,290 ha affected. Soil loss from slopes during the subsequent rainfall
   event was modelled up to 25 t ha(-1), compared to a long-term mean
   annual soil loss of 1.06 t ha(-1) year(-1). Groundcover averages
   generally increased after the fire until spring 2015, by which time
   rates of soil loss returned to near pre-fire levels. Streams were filled
   with sand to bank full levels after the fire and rainfall. Rainfall
   events in 2015-2016 shifted creek systems into a major erosive phase,
   with incision through the post-fire sandy bedload deposits, an erosive
   phase likely related to loss of topsoils over much of the catchment. The
   effectiveness of the research was secured by a close engagement with
   park managers in issue identification and a communications programme.
   Management outcomes flowing from the research included installation of
   erosion control works, redesign of access and monitoring of key mass

Abstract = {{Though observations on re-colonisation of post-fire sites in the
   Mediterranean Basin are plentiful, there still is an ongoing debate on
   the interrelation of fire regimes and species traits related to fire
   adaptation. Most of the studies found are restricted to particular
   species or claim to present community attributes. Therefore they often
   lack information for the evaluation of evolutionary evidence and
   historical contingency of the local fire regime and other abiotic
   conditions, which may act as selective pressure for plant regeneration
   strategies. Indeed, knowledge about the success of regeneration
   mechanisms and their interrelation with ecological factors is essential
   for the interpretation of the high spatio-temporal variability found in
   post-fire species performance. Such knowledge would be necessary to
   assess the potential of different regeneration mechanisms to cope with
   ongoing land-use and climate change-a crucial scientific challenge.A
   summary is given of the knowledge about the limits and potential of
   plant regeneration mechanisms after fire in the Mediterranean Basin,
   along with corresponding studies conducted in other parts of the world
   with similar climatic conditions in order to present the fullest
   possible picture. Moreover, the positive or negative impacts of
   particular parameters of a fire regime on different regeneration
   strategies (post-fire seeders, resprouters, and facultative resprouters)
   are explained and discussed in the light of published literature. To
   conclude, reference is made to scientific gaps that need to be filled in

Abstract = {{Life-history attributes can impose differences on root system structures
   and properties related to nutrient and water uptake. Here, we assess
   whether plants with different post-fire regenerative strategies
   (resprouters, seeders and seeder-resprouters) differ in the topological
   and morphological properties of their root systems (external path,
   altitude, magnitude, topological index, specific root length, root
   length, root-to-shoot biomass ratio, length of the main axis of the root
   system and link length). To achieve these objectives, we sampled
   individuals from eight woody species in a shrubland located in the
   western Mediterranean Basin. We sampled the adult root systems using
   manual field excavation with the aid of an air compressor. The results
   indicate that resprouters have a higher root-to-shoot ratio, confirming
   their higher ability to store water, starch and nutrients and to invest
   in the belowground biomass. Moreover, this pattern would allow them to
   explore deeper parts of the soil layers. Seeder species would benefit
   from a higher specific root length, pointing to increased relative root
   growth and water uptake rates. This study confirms that seeders and
   resprouters may differ in nutrient and water uptake ability according to
   the characteristics of their root system. Species that can both resprout
   and establish seedlings after fire had different patterns of root system
   structure; in particular, root:shoot ratio was more similar to
   resprouters and specific root length was closer to seeders, supporting
   the distinct functional performance of this type of species.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{497-506}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Past and present human activities, such as historic agriculture and fire
   suppression, are widespread and can create depauperate plant
   communities. Although many studies show that herbivory on focal plants
   depends on the density of herbivores or the composition of the
   surrounding plant community, it is unclear whether anthropogenic changes
   to plant communities alter herbivory. We tested the hypothesis that
   human activities that alter the plant community lead to subsequent
   changes in herbivory. At 20 sites distributed across 80 300 hectares, we
   conducted a field experiment that manipulated insect herbivore access
   (full exclosures and pseudo-exclosures) to four focal plant species in
   longleaf pine woodlands with different land-use histories
   (post-agricultural sites or non-agricultural sites) and degrees of fire
   frequency (frequent and infrequent). Plant cover, particularly
   herbaceous cover, was lower in post-agricultural and fire suppressed
   woodlands. Density of the dominant insect herbivore at our site
   (grasshoppers) was positively related to plant cover. Herbivore access
   reduced biomass of the palatable forb Solidago odora in frequently
   burned post-agricultural sites and in infrequently burned
   non-agricultural woodlands and increased mortality of another forb
   (Pityopsis graminifolia), but did not affect two other less palatable
   species (Schizachyrium scoparium and Tephrosia virginiana). Herbivory on
   S. odora exhibited a hump-shaped response to plant cover, with low
   herbivory at low and high levels of plant cover. Herbivore density had a
   weak negative effect on herbivory. These findings suggest that changes
   in plant cover related to past and present human activities can modify
   damage rates on focal S. odora plants by altering grasshopper foraging
   behavior rather than by altering local grasshopper density. The
   resulting changes in herbivory may have the potential to limit natural
   recovery or restoration efforts by reducing the establishment or
   performance of palatable plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Mata Nacional da Margaraga represents a rare example where the Atlantic
   climate influences the perpetuity of a small enclave of a previously
   widespread laurel forest. The higher relative humidity values (> 80\%),
   which are almost constant all year long and the mild temperatures,
   rarely exceeding 30 degrees C, even in the dry season (June to
   September), create an insular-like effect. The biological communities of
   Margaraga exhibit a transitory character. The forest is dominated by
   Quercus robur and Castanea sativa, yet Quercus suber, although less
   frequent, can also be found. The laurel species, such as Viburnum tinus,
   Ilex aquifolium, Laurus nobilis and the Portuguese endemic Prunus
   lusitanica ssp. lusitanica, relics from the ancient Portuguese Tertiary,
   comprise the understorey. The present work represents, to the best of
   our knowledge, the first regional macrofungal species list of the Mata
   da Margaraga published to date. The recent fires that occurred in the
   area have provided the opportunity to study the post-fire communities.
   The surveys were carried out in 2004 and later in 2018-2019. A total of
   271 species were registered as belonging to Basidiomycota (approximate
   to 80\%) and Ascomycota (approximate to 20\%). The most represented
   Basidiomycota families were Russulaceae, Mycenaceae and Agaricaceae and
   the most represented Ascomycota families were Pyronemataceae and
   Pezizaceae. The new records to Portugal add up to a total of 88 species

Abstract = {{Although boreal forests are biomes which are characterized by periodical
   forest wildfires, very little is known about adaptations to fire in
   forest herbs. We investigated whether a putatively fire-dependent
   herbaceous species Pulsatilla patens demonstrated adaptive responses to
   environmental cues that reflect differences in pre-fire and post-fire
   environments (the presence of ericoid litter and charcoal, and light
   levels). For comparison, we included in the experiment a close
   congeneric species that is less bound to forest ecosystems (Pulsatilla
   pratensis) and a morphologically similar mesic grassland species from
   the same family (Ranunculus polyanthemos), as examples of species for
   which adaptations to fire should be of lower value, or of no value at
   all, respectively. The addition of ericoid litter to the soil generally
   enhanced plant growth, suggesting that its negative effect on plant
   germination and growth is not as widespread as previously thought. In
   both Pulsatilla species charcoal without forest litter retarded plant
   growth, but in combination with ericoid litter the negative effect
   disappeared or was even replaced by a slightly positive effect. Such an
   interactive effect was absent in the grassland species R. polyanthernos.
   The response of Pulsatilla species to different post-fire signals may be
   explained by adaptive down-regulation of growth after high-intensity
   fire small plant size can be advantageous in sparse and well illuminated
   field-layer vegetation and intense growth in the more competitive
   situation following weak fire. An additional experiment demonstrated
   that the effects of fire-related treatments were not mediated by

Abstract = {{Soil seed banks play a major role in the post-fire regeneration of
   Mediterranean shrublands. They vary throughout the year in species
   composition, abundance, and readiness to germinate. After fire,
   germination occurs mainly during the following fall to spring. Time of
   germination can determine recruitment success. It is unclear what
   factors control post-fire germination and its timing. We tested the
   effects of season and fire on the readily germinable soil seed bank of a
   seeder-dominated shrubland. Plots were burned early and late in the
   summer season (ES, LS). Soil samples were collected before and after
   fire, and germinated in a chamber simulating successively autumn,
   winter, and spring conditions. Samples were kept moistened at all times.
   Fire intensity was similar between ES and LS. Several species of Cistus
   and herbs, mostly annuals, were dominant. Most germination occurred
   during the simulated-autumn period, with little subsequent germination
   during the following two periods. Germination speed (T (50)) during
   simulated-autumn was similar for shrubs and herbs, and independent of
   season or fire. Germination was lower for two shrubs (Rosmarinus
   officinalis, Cistus salvifolius) and higher for herbaceous dicots in LS
   than in ES soils. Fire reduced monocots and enhanced Cistus. Germination
   period significantly interacted with fire and season in some groups or
   species, altering the simulated-autumn germination peak. We demonstrate
   that the seed bank can germinate swiftly under simulated-autumn
   conditions. Hence, water availability is the main controlling factor of
   germination. Fire season differentially affected some species or groups,
   and could affect the post-fire regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Rotational swidden cultivation systems, with fallow periods long enough

   Post-harvest basal area growth generally increased with harvest

Abstract = {{In western North American conifer forests, wildfires are increasing in
   frequency and severity due to heavy fuel loads that have accumulated
   after a century of fire suppression. Forest restoration treatments
   (e.g., thinning and/or burning) are being designed and implemented at
   large spatial and temporal scales in an effort to reduce fire risk and
   restore forest structure and function. In ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests, predominantly open forest structure and a frequent,
   low-severity fire regime constituted the evolutionary environment for
   wildlife that persisted for thousands of years. Small mammals are
   important in forest ecosystems as prey and in affecting primary
   production and decomposition. During 2006-2009, we trapped eight species
   of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona and used occupancy
   modeling to determine community responses to thinning and habitat
   features. The most important covariates in predicting small mammal
   occupancy were understory vegetation cover, large snags, and treatment.
   Our analysis identified two generalist species found at relatively high
   occupancy rates across all sites, four open-forest species that
   responded positively to treatment, and two dense-forest species that
   responded negatively to treatment unless specific habitat features were
   retained. Our results indicate that all eight small mammal species can
   benefit from restoration treatments, particularly if aspects of their
   evolutionary environment (e.g., large trees, snags, woody debris) are
   restored. The occupancy modeling approach we used resulted in precise
   species-level estimates of occupancy in response to habitat attributes
   for a greater number of small mammal species than in other comparable
   studies. We recommend our approach for other studies faced with high
   variability and broad spatial and temporal scales in assessing impacts
   of treatments or habitat alteration on wildlife species. Moreover, since
   forest planning efforts are increasingly focusing on progressively
   larger treatment implementation, better and more efficiently, obtained
   ecological information is needed to inform these efforts.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that, where fire has historically been
   infrequent, wooded areas chat have been invaded by grasses and converted
   to grassland by fire are predisposed to future fire compared to adjacent
   areas that remain wooded; thus, an initial forest fire may promote
   future fires. We compared microclimate between a grass-dominated burned
   area and a nearby grass-invaded woodland that has not burned in recent
   history, both located in the submontane dry forest of Hawaii Volcanoes
   National Park. The results were used to parameterize BEHAVE, a fire
   behavior prediction model developed by the USDA Forest Service. The
   model's predictions include probability of ignition, intensity, rate of
   spread, and tree mortality. Contrary to expectations, daytime hourly
   mean temperatures were higher and relative humidity was lower in the
   woodland site. However, the differences in temperature and humidity were
   not great enough to affect spread rare or probability of ignition. Wind
   speeds were substantially greater in the grassland, and this was most
   important in driving differences in modeled fire spread. Given similar
   synoptic conditions, a fire started in the grassland can be expected to
   spread an order of magnitude faster than one started in the woodland.}},

   method, time since last treatment, and retained tree cover on shrubland
   bird abundance and habitat conditions. Burned and mechanically treated
   wildlife openings differed only in grass and fern cover. Both types of
   wildlife openings had more grasses and forbs, and less bare ground than
   silvicultural openings. Six out of 8 focal bird species were less
   abundant in silvicultural openings than in wildlife openings. In
   contrast, abundance of only 1 species differed between burned and
   mechanically treated wildlife openings. Silvicultural openings supported
   the same species as wildlife openings, indicating that this management
   option could be used in place of more costly wildlife opening
   management. However, because birds were more abundant in wildlife
   openings, maintaining the current population size of shrubland birds
   under a management strategy based entirely on silviculture would require
   a 50-300\% increase in the area of silvicultural openings, depending on
   the species. Individual species peaked in abundance at different times
   post treatment, indicating that managers must maintain a range of
   early-successional conditions across the landscape to provide habitat
   for the entire suite of shrubland birds. Six species exhibited a
   negative relationship with the basal area of retained conifer cover, and
   7 species with deciduous tree cover, indicating that the retention of

Abstract = {{Understanding tree mortality after fires can be used to improve planning
   of prescribed burning and post-burning salvage logging. This study aims
   to assess the effects of burning season, fire severity and tree size on
   the evolution of post-burning mortality of pine species with different
   fire resistance traits. In 2013, two paired plots (1 ha each) were
   burned, one in spring and the other in fall, in two mixed-stands of P.
   sylvestris and P. nigra, and the fire severity and tree size variables
   were measured. Mortality was assessed individually in a total of 933
   pines during the following 3 years post-burning. We modeled the initial
   (1 year post-burning) and delayed (3 years post-burning) tree mortality
   using Firth logistic regression and Conditional Inference trees. The
   probability of dying after burning was lower in P. nigra than in P.
   sylvestris confirming that P. nigra has higher fire-resistance compared
   to the moderate fire-resistance of P. sylvestris. Initial mortality was
   slightly higher for pines burned in spring than for those burned in
   fall; however, after 3 years the proportion of pines that had died after
   the fall burns was higher than that after the spring burns.
   Nevertheless, for the two periods modeled, the likelihood of a pine
   dying was significantly higher in spring than in fall given a certain
   level of crown scorch. This suggests that pines with damaged crowns were
   more likely to die when burning occurred during periods of active
   growth. However, the higher fire severities at the base of the trees
   that occurred during the fall burns compared to the spring burns are
   probably the cause of the higher rates of delayed tree mortality. Higher
   likelihood of mortality in trees burned in fall, with higher percentages
   of white ashes in the stem base suggest basal stem girdling as a cause
   of delayed pine mortality. We can conclude that crown damage is more
   detrimental when burning occurs during the growth season, while longer
   combustion times during fall burns may have caused the higher delayed
   pine mortality in comparison with spring burns.}},

   (1) an image-based burn severity mapping approach using the Differenced
   Normalised Burn Ratio, and (2) a fire effects simulation approach using
   the FIREHARM model. The image-based approach was moderately correlated

   correlated with percentage fuel consumption and weakly correlated with
   percentage tree mortality. Burn severity maps produced by the two

   approaches had the same overall map agreement when compared with a

Abstract = {{Gradual changes in vegetation structure and composition are expected to
   result from continuous environmental change with increasing elevation on
   mountains. Hence, the occurrence of abrupt or discrete ecotones in
   vegetation patterns is intriguing and may suggest key controls on
   community assembly in montane forests. We review tropical montane forest
   (TMF) zonation patterns focusing on a case study from the Cordillera
   Central, Hispaniola where a striking discontinuity in forest composition
   occurs consistently at similar to 2000 m elevation, with cloud forest
   below and monodominant pine forest above. We propose that a
   discontinuity in climatic factors (temperature, humidity) associated
   with the trade-wind inversion (TWI) is the primary cause of this and
   other ecotones in TMFs that occur at a generally consistent elevation.
   Low humidity, fires and occasional frost above the TWI favor pine over
   cloud forest species. Fires in the high-elevation pine forest have
   repeatedly burned down to the ecotone boundary and extinguished in the
   cloud forest owing to its low flammability, reinforced by high humidity,
   cloud immersion and epiphytic bryophyte cover. Small-scale fire patterns
   along the ecotone are influenced by topography and where forest
   structure is impacted by hurricanes and landslides. Analogous patterns
   are observed worldwide in other TMFs where the TWI is important,
   high-elevation fires are frequent, and the flora contains frost-tolerant
   species (often of temperate lineage). The response of this and other
   TMFs to anthropogenic climate change is highly uncertain owing to
   potentially countervailing effects of different climatic phenomena,
   including warming temperatures and decreased frost; changes in the TWI,
   high-elevation drought or cloudiness; and increased frequency or
   intensity of hurricanes and El Nino-Southern Oscillation events.}},

   radiotelemetry to investigate winter roost-site selection by Seminole
   bats (Lasiurus seminolus) on an intensively managed landscape with
   forested corridors in southeastern South Carolina, USA. We modeled
   roost-site selection with logistic regression and used Akaike's
   Information Criterion for small samples (AIC(c)) and Akaike weights to
   select models relating roost-site selection to plot-and landscape-level
   variables. We tracked 20 adult male bats to 71 individual roosts. Bats
   used a variety of roosting structures, including the canopy of overstory
   trees, understory vegetation, pine (Pinus spp.) needle clusters, and
   leaf litter. Roost height, structure type, and habitat type were
   influenced by changes in minimum nightly temperature. On warmer nights,
   bats selected taller trees in mature forest stands, but when minimum
   nightly temperatures were <4 degrees C, bats typically were found
   roosting on or near the forest floor in mid-rotation stands. We
   recommend avoiding prescribed burning in mid-rotation stands on days
   when the previous night's temperature is < 4 degrees C to minimize
   potential disturbance and direct mortality of bats roosting on or near
   the forest floor. We encourage forest managers to incorporate seasonal

Abstract = {{Changes in vegetation and fuels were evaluated from measurements taken

   treatments, and the combination of the two) at 12 Fire and Fire
   Surrogate (FFS) sites located in forests with a surface. re regime
   across the conterminous United States. To test the relative
   effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments and their effect on
   ecological parameters we used an information-theoretic approach on a
   suite of 12 variables representing the overstory (basal area and live
   tree, sapling, and snag density), the understory (seedling density,
   shrub cover, and native and alien herbaceous species richness), and the
   most relevant fuel parameters for wild. re damage (height to live crown,
   total fuel bed mass, forest floor mass, and woody fuel mass).
   In the short term (one year after treatment), mechanical treatments were
   more effective at reducing overstory tree density and basal area and at
   increasing quadratic mean tree diameter. Prescribed. re treatments were
   more effective at creating snags, killing seedlings, elevating height to
   live crown, and reducing surface woody fuels. Overall, the response to
   fuel reduction treatments of the ecological variables presented in this
   paper was generally maximized by the combined mechanical plus burning
   treatment. If the management goal is to quickly produce stands with
   fewer and larger diameter trees, less surface fuel mass, and greater
   herbaceous species richness, the combined treatment gave the most
   desirable results. However, because mechanical plus burning treatments
   also favored alien species invasion at some sites, monitoring and

Abstract = {{Fire regimes have a major influence on biodiversity in many ecosystems
   around the globe, yet our understanding of the longer-term response of
   fauna is typically poor. We sampled bats with ultrasonic detectors in
   three different years in dry sclerophyll forests of south-eastern
   Australia in a long-term, management-scale experiment. Frequent
   low-intensity burning (every 2 or 4 years plus unburnt) and logging
   (with 33\% retention of the original unlogged tree basal area) were
   manipulated to assess their effects on bats. We found that both the fire
   regime and regrowth after logging influenced the local bat community.
   The routine burning treatment (burnt every 4 years) in unlogged forest
   was consistently related to higher total bat activity (2-3 times) and
   species richness when compared to unburnt controls and logging
   treatments. Foraging activity was more variable, but it was typically
   lowest in Unlogged Unburnt Controls. These patterns were evident at both
   the detector site scale and the block scale and were probably due to a
   reduction in understorey stem density with burning, especially in
   unlogged forest. Bat activity was significantly lower across the entire
   study area (including controls) in 1 year, when sampling occurred within
   6 months of burning. When pooled across burning treatments, unlogged
   forest supported higher bat activity (1.5 times) and species richness
   than logged forest (12- to 17-year-old regrowth), again most likely
   because of a negative association with high stem density in regrowth
   after logging. We conclude that low-intensity burning had positive
   benefits for echolocating bats, most notably in unlogged forest.
   However, careful planning is required to generate heterogeneous
   vegetation patterns that are likely to be most suitable for a range of
   taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Literature on relationships between wildfires and vegetation in
   Mediterranean areas indicates high resilience ability for most
   ecosystems on calcareous soils, but data are scarce for acidic soils.
   The resilience ability of a ``fire-driven{''} ecosystem is expected to
   depend both on the characteristics of the ecosystem and on the fire
   recurrence.
   We investigated the vegetation according to fire recurrence in a site
   with ecological and patrimonial stakes (the Maures massif, Provence,
   South Eastern France), in order to determine which ecosystems are more
   resilient and why. We sampled different modalities of fire recurrence
   (frequency of fires and interval of time between fires), and we
   investigated vegetation resilience to fire through different components
   such as composition, richness, diversity and structure. The sites
   corresponded to five modalities of increasing fire recurrence since
   1959: control plots which had not burned since 1959, plots burned by a
   major and intense wildfire in 1990 (= reference fire), other plots
   burned twice or thrice before the 1990 fire and plots burned several
   times then and in 2003.
   The results confirmed that our Mediterranean ecosystems on acidic soils
   are mainly auto-successional, as vegetation composition remained rather
   constant after fire. Significant differences of composition existed
   between the control plots and the plots lastly affected by the 2003
   fire. In contrast, significant differences of functional diversity (i.e.
   plant traits) existed among the five modalities, in particular an
   increase of ruderal species and a decrease of competitive taxa with
   increasing fire recurrence. Moreover, some types of vegetation were
   identified according to fire recurrence modalities. A variation
   partitioning procedure (partial CCA) indicated that the environmental
   data set explained better the plant distribution than the fire
   recurrence data set.
   The final objective of the study is to improve the understanding of the
   interrelationships between fires and the dynamics of vegetation, for a
   sustainable management of these Mediterranean ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of pion-juniper woodlands the past 100 years in the
   western United States has resulted in large scale efforts to kill trees
   and recover sagebrush steppe rangelands. It is important to evaluate
   vegetation recovery following woodland control to develop best
   management practices. In this study, we compared two fuel reduction
   treatments and a cut-and-leave (CUT) treatment used to control western
   juniper (Juniperus occidentalis spp. occidentalis Hook.) of the
   northwestern United States. Treatments were; CUT, cut-and-broadcast burn
   (BURN), and cut-pile-and-burn the pile (PILE). A randomized complete
   block design was used with five replicates of each treatment located in
   a curl leaf mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius Nutt. ex Torr. \& A.
   Gray)/mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. spp. vaseyana
   (Rydb.) Beetle)/Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer) association. In
   2010, 4 years after tree control the cover of perennial grasses (PG)
   {[}Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Pres) and large bunchgrasses]
   were about 4 and 5 \% less, respectively, in the BURN (7.1 +/- A 0.6 \%)
   than the PILE (11.4 +/- A 2.3 \%) and CUT (12.4 +/- A 1.7 \%) treatments
   (P < 0.0015). In 2010, cover of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.)
   was greater in the BURN (6.3 +/- A 1.0 \%) and was 50 and 100 \% greater
   than PILE and CUT treatments, respectively. However, the increase in
   perennial bunchgrass density and cover, despite cheatgrass in the BURN
   treatment, mean it unlikely that cheatgrass will persist as a major
   understory component. In the CUT treatment mahogany cover increased 12.5
   \% and density increased in from 172 +/- A 25 to 404 +/- A 123 trees/ha.
   Burning, killed most or all of the adult mahogany, and mahogany recovery
   consisted of 100 and 67 \% seedlings in the PILE and BURN treatments,
   respectively. After treatment, juniper presence from untreated small
   trees (< 1 m tall; PILE and CUT treatments) and seedling emergence (all
   treatments) represented 25-33 \% of pre-treatment tree density. To
   maintain recovery of herbaceous, shrub, and mahogany species additional
   control of reestablished juniper will be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a simulation model for predicting the recruitment
   response of Pinus nigra from unburned edges in areas affected by large
   wildfires, where the regeneration of burned forests of this tree species
   is very low. We have simulated the distribution of P. nigra seedlings at
   different distances from the unburned edges by integrating empirical
   field data for the different processes affecting seed and seedling
   success. The simulation model determines the final number of seedlings
   established in any subplot, within the burned area, as the
   multiplication of a number of statistically independent processes, from
   cone and seed production and predation, to seed germination and seedling
   establishment. Probabilities are drawn at random at each time step from
   the experimental distributions that describe those processes. The model
   runs for a given number of years, thus simulating the accumulative
   effects on the total number of established seedlings of the different
   processes involved. That represents one model run, which is then
   repeated a sufficient number of times to calculate simulated
   distributions of established seedlings as a function of distance from
   the forest edge. The validation of those results with data from field
   measurements of seedling establishment in old-burned areas has
   demonstrated the ability of the simulation algorithm to reproduce
   observed results. Furthermore, the simulations carried out with the
   model for actual plots, located near the margins of the burned areas
   affected by the largest fires affecting P. nigra forests in Catalonia in
   recent years, have all shown striking similarities. The simulated values
   of established seedlings follow a Gaussian-like distribution in the
   first 100 in, with a wide range of 2000-25,000 seedlings/ha. There is
   also a clear trend for plots with medium and large trees to show an
   increment in increasing seedling establishment with tree density whereas
   plots dominated by small trees give very low regeneration values. (c)

Title = {{Evaluation of Spectral Indices for Assessing Fire Severity in Australian
   Temperate Forests}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Spectral indices derived from optical remote sensing data have been
   widely used for fire-severity classification in forests from local to
   global scales. However, comparative analyses of multiple indices across
   diverse forest types are few. This represents an information gap for
   fire management agencies in areas like temperate south-eastern
   Australia, which is characterised by a diversity of natural forests that
   vary in structure, and in the fire-regeneration strategies of the
   dominant trees. We evaluate 10 spectral indices across eight areas burnt
   by wildfires in 1998, 2006, 2007, and 2009 in south-eastern Australia.
   These wildfire areas encompass 13 forest types, which represent 86\% of
   the 7.9M ha region's forest area. Forest types were aggregated into six
   forest groups based on their fire-regeneration strategies (seeders,
   resprouters) and structure (tree height and canopy cover). Index
   performance was evaluated for each forest type and forest group by
   examining its sensitivity to four fire-severity classes (unburnt, low,
   moderate, high) using three independent methods (anova, separability,
   and optimality). For the best-performing indices, we calculated
   index-specific thresholds (by forest types and groups) to separate
   between the four severity classes, and evaluated the accuracy of
   fire-severity classification on independent samples. Our results
   indicated that the best-performing indices of fire severity varied with
   forest type and group. Overall accuracy for the best-performing indices
   ranged from 0.50 to 0.78, and kappa values ranged from 0.33 (fair
   agreement) to 0.77 (substantial agreement), depending on the forest
   group and index. Fire severity in resprouter open forests and woodlands
   was most accurately mapped using the delta Normalised Burnt ratio
   (dNBR). In contrast, dNDVI (delta Normalised difference vegetation
   index) performed best for open forests with mixed fire responses
   (resprouters and seeders), and dNDWI (delta Normalised difference water
   index) was the most accurate for obligate seeder closed forests. Our
   analysis highlighted the low sensitivity of all indices to fire impacts
   in Rainforest. We conclude that the optimal spectral index for
   quantifying fire severity varies with forest type, but that there is
   scope to group forests by structure and fire-regeneration strategy to
   simplify fire-severity classification in heterogeneous forest
   landscapes.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{193-205}},
Abstract = {{Dry eucalypt forests are believed to be highly fire tolerant, but their
   response to fire is not well quantified. We measured the effect of
   high-severity fires in dry eucalypt forest in the Tasmanian Midlands,
   the driest region on the island. We compared stand structures and fuel
   loads in long-unburnt (>15 years since fire) and recently burnt (<5
   years since fire) sites that had been completely defoliated. Even in
   unburnt plots, 37\% of eucalypt stems and 56\% of acacia stems >= 5 cm
   in diameter were dead, possibly because of antecedent drought. The
   density of live eucalypt stems was 37\% lower overall in burnt than in
   unburnt plots, compared with 78\% lower for acacias. Whole-plant
   mortality caused by fire was estimated at 25\% for eucalypt trees and
   33\% for acacias. Fire stimulated establishment of both eucalypt and
   acacia seedlings, although some seedlings and saplings were present in
   long-unburnt plots. The present study confirmed that eucalypts in dry
   forests are more tolerant of fire than the obligate seeder eucalypts in
   wet forests. However, there were few live mature stems remaining in some
   burnt plots, suggesting that dry eucalypt forests could be vulnerable to
   increasingly frequent, severe fires.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem vs. community recovery 25 years after grass invasions and fire
   in a subtropical woodland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1462-1474}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Despite a large body of research documenting invasive plant impacts,
   few studies have followed individual invaded sites over decades to
   observe how they change, and none have contrasted how compositional
   impacts from invasion compare to ecosystem-process impacts over a
   multi-decadal time-scale.
   2. Using direct measurements of plant density and composition and of
   ecosystems processes, we evaluate how ecosystem structure, above-ground
   net primary production (ANPP), and above-ground and soil nutrient pools
   compare over 25 years since fire and C4 grass invasions disrupted
   seasonally dry Hawaiian woodlands. We compare structure and function
   between primary woodland that has never burned and is largely native
   species-dominated, with sites that had been the same woodland type but
   burned in alien-grass-fuelled fires in the 1970s and 1980s. The sites
   have not experienced fires since 1987.
   3. We report here that woody plant composition and structure continue to
   be dramatically changed by the initial invasions and fires that occurred
   25 years ago and invaders continue to dominate in burned sites. This is
   reflected in continued low plant carbon pools in burned compared to
   unburned sites. Yet ANPP and N storage, which were dramatically lower in
   the initial decade after invasive-grass fuelled fires, have increased
   and are now indistinguishable from values measured in intact woodlands.
   Soil carbon pools were resilient to both invasion and fire initially and
   over time.
   4. Above-ground net primary production has recovered because of invasion
   of burned sites by a non-native N-fixing tree rather than because of
   recovery of native species. This invasive N-fixing tree is unlikely to
   return C storage of the invaded sites to those of unburned woodland
   because of its tissue and growth characteristics and its interactions
   with invasive grasses. It does not facilitate native species but rather
   promotes a persistent invasive grass/N-fixer savanna.
   5. Synthesis. We conclude that fire, an unusual disturbance in this
   system, has perpetuated the dominance of these sites by invasive species
   and that despite the dramatic recovery of above-ground net primary
   production and N pools, the ecosystem continues to be in a distinctly
   different state than the pre-fire, pre-Melinis community. Thus, despite
   the absence of further disturbance (fire), there is no evidence that
   succession towards the original ecosystem is occurring. The fact that N
   pools and above-ground net primary production recover because of a new
   invader (Morella faya), highlights the unpredictability of ecosystem
   trajectories in the face of altered regional species pools.}},

Abstract = {{The North American boreal forest has been developing since the end of
   the last glaciation approximately 10,000 yr ago. With climate warming
   and human occupation, it is anticipated that fire danger, ignition, and
   activity will be increasing, compromising forests' benefits for
   generations to come. In this study, we show, however, that a century of
   rapid climate changes and human densification has had the opposite
   effect in the boreal eastern interior of the North American continent,
   reducing biomass burning to values below two millennia of historical
   levels. A multi-millennial fire history was reconstructed for eight
   forested landscapes from the Lake of the Woods Ecoregion (LWE) located
   at the boreal-prairie ecotone. Fire history was reconstructed using a
   combination of archival (period 1920-2010), tree-ring (stand initiations
   and fire scars: period 1690-2010), and lake sediment charcoal (2500 BP
   to present) records. The archival record revealed recent large fires
   (>200 ha) in 1948, 1980, and 1988. An additional 19 fires were
   identified by the fire-scar record. Fire events in 1805,1840, 1863, and
   the 1890s were identified in numerous locations around multiple lakes
   suggesting that they were of large extents. In accordance with the
   tree-ring record, the charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR) peak record
   generally identified the major fires but tended to lag from the
   tree-ring records by several decades. Within LWE, the long-term charcoal
   record revealed that CHAR was higher for each lake in the earlier
   portion of the record including the warm Medieval Climate Anomaly (AD
   -900 to AD 1000), followed by a progressive decrease toward the cool
   Little Tee Age period. This decline was abruptly interrupted in the mid-
   to late 19th century with large synchronized fires, also reported over
   western and central North America, and resumed approximately four
   decades later. Fire disturbance level is today below the historical
   range, despite the accentuated climate warming. Aging of the forest
   landscape may create biodiversity loss notably in fire-adapted species
   while at the same time setting the tone for major fires in upcoming
   decades if no action is taken for managing fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics after slash-burn agriculture are
   poorly understood in African tropical forest, though recent studies have
   revealed C4 grass invasion as a forest understory influences SOC
   dynamics after deforestation. This study aimed to quantify the relative
   SOC contribution of C4 and C3 plants separately through the sequential
   fallow periods of forest (cropland, or 4-7, 20-30, or >50 years of
   fallow forest) in the tropical forest of eastern Cameroon. We evaluated
   the SOC stock and natural C-13 abundance for each layer. The SOC stock
   was largest in 4-7 years fallow forest (136.6 +/- 8.8 Mg C ha(-1); 100cm
   depth, and C4:C3 = 58:42), and decreased with increasing fallow period.
   SOC from C4 plants was larger in the 4-7 and 20-30 years fallow forests

Title = {{Less fuel for the fire: malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) nesting activity
   affects fuel loads and fire behaviour}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{640-648}},
Abstract = {{Context. Fire is an important driver of species distributions globally.
   At the same time, biota also influence fire regimes. Animal activities
   that modify fuel characteristics may influence fire regimes and hence
   ecosystem function. However, apart from herbivory, animal effects on
   fuels and fire behaviour have rarely been studied.
   Aims. Weexamined the effect of nest building by malleefowl (Leipoa
   ocellata) on litter fuel loads and fire behaviour in the fire- prone,
   semiarid mallee ecosystem of south-eastern Australia. Malleefowl nests
   consist of mounds constructed by raking large amounts of leaf litter
   from the surrounding area. Mound-building activity is likely to affect
   fuel loads and potentially affect fire behaviour in this environment.
   Methods. Litter cover and mass were compared between paired mound and
   non-mound sites. Fire behaviour modelling was used to determine whether
   differences in fuel load were likely to translate into differences in
   fire behaviour. Additionally, in an area recently burnt by wildfire, the
   minimum diameter of burnt stems was compared between mound and non-mound
   sites to determine the effects of malleefowl activity on fire intensity.
   Key results. Malleefowl nesting activity reduced litter fuel loads
   around mounds. Fire behaviour modelling and post-fire minimum stem
   diameter measurements showed this led to reduced fire intensity around
   mounds, even under extreme fire weather conditions.
   Conclusions. The likelihood and intensity of fire is reduced around
   active malleefowl mounds. Malleefowl nesting contributes to more
   heterogeneous burn patterns in mallee vegetation. This in turn may
   contribute to the formation of fire refuges.}},

Abstract = {{The biomass and chemical composition in six dominant field and bottom
   layer species was followed during four years after a fire in a Pinus
   sylvestris forest in western Norway. Three fire intensity levels were
   distinguished: low, medium and high. The overall biomass in the
   different species was estimated from the biomass per shoot, the shoot
   densities in pure stands of the investigated species and the percentage
   cover at medium burned sites. Corresponding measurements were made at
   control plots outside the burned area.
   A strong post-fire increase in the overall biomass of Calluna vulgaris,
   Polytrichum spp., Deschampsia flexuosa and Pteridium aquilinum was
   found, against a much slower regrowth of Vaccinium myrtillus and V.
   vitis-idaea. The Vaccinium species and Calluna were the dominant species
   at the control plot. Accumulation of carbohydrates seemed to take place
   in green and non-green tissue of Pteridium and Deschampsia. A
   corresponding accumulation of nitrogen was found in green and nongreen
   Calluna and in non-green Vaccinium myrtillus tissue, and of phosphorus
   in green and non-green tissue of both Vaccinium species and Calluna as a
   result of fire. The regrowth of Calluna was mainly from seeds that
   appeared to be present in the soil before the fire. The regeneration of
   Pteridium and the two Vaccinium species took place almost exclusively
   vegetatively from below-ground rhizomes that had survived the fire.
   Three years after the fire the overall biomass at the burned site was
   higher than at the control site, due to improved light and nutrient
   conditions. However, the biomass is expected to decrease in the future
   and the species composition will probably change as nutrients are
   leached out of the soil and Pinus and deciduous trees (Betula pubescens
   and Salix caprea) regenerate from seeds and roots, leading to increased
   competition in the field and shrub layer.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the range of Quercus macrocarpa, fire historically played an
   important role in maintaining Quercus stands. However, little is known
   about the role of fire in maintaining stringer Quercus stands on the
   western edge of its distribution. This research suggests that prescribed
   burning could be used to rejuvenate woody plants in Quercus woodlands.
   Relative to unburned areas, there were more (p < 0.1) Quercus, Fraxinus
   pennsylvanica and Acer negundo sprouts following spring burning.
   However, Quercus seedling density did not increase (p = 0.22) relative
   to unburned sites, and changes in the density of woody understory
   species in response to burning were erratic. Dormant season burning has
   some appeal from a fire control point of view and because carbohydrate
   reserves in woody plants are high during this time. However, if the
   objective is to regenerate woody plants and/or mimic historical fires,
   prescriptions should be set to achieve high intensities.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increased incidence of wildfire in oak (Quercus spp.) woodland
   and the increased use of prescribed burning as a management tool, few
   empirical data are available on the effects of burning to wildlife in
   oak woodlands. During the fall of 1993 to the fall of 1997, we studied
   the effects of prescribed burning on woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes) relative
   abundance in oak woodland at Camp Roberts in coastal-central California.
   In October 1997, the California Department of Forestry and Fire
   Protection (CDF) conducted an experimental burn over 500 acres of oak
   woodland at Camp Roberts, including half of our 1-ha study plots. On
   average, nearly half of each plot was burned (range = 30-66\%). CDF
   classified the burn as light to medium intensity. Of the 14 vegetation
   variables measured before and after the burn, 5 were reduced
   significantly: cover of grasses, green forbs, and shrubs, abundance of
   coarse woody debris, and number of woodrat houses. In the falls of 1993
   to 1996 (pre-burn) and again in the fall of 1997 (post-burn), relative
   abundance of woodrats was measured by live trapping. Trap success and
   proportion of recaptures did not differ pre- vs. post-burn.
   Additionally, the sex ratio of woodrats was not different after the burn
   in fall 1997 between burned and unburned plots. Our results indicate
   that low-intensity prescribed burns in oak woodland have minimal
   short-term (<1 year) effects on resident woodrats. Furthermore, any
   potentially negative effects of low-intensity prescribed burns on
   woodrats may be mitigated by positive, longer-term effects, such as
   reduced competition for oak regeneration, rejuvenation of vegetation,
   and reduction of fuel load and the threat of catastrophic wildfire. We
   are continuing to monitor the woodrat abundance to evaluate responses
   over the longer term.}},

Abstract = {{Residual patches of forest remaining after natural or anthropogenic
   disturbance may facilitate regeneration of fragmented forest. However,
   residual patch function remains unclear, especially after natural
   wildfire. We investigate the role of residual boreal forest patches as
   refugia for bryophytes and ask the question, do they house bryophyte
   communities similar to those encountered in undisturbed forests?
   Bryophytes were sampled in three habitat types in black spruce boreal
   forests illustrating a gradient of disturbance severity: undisturbed
   forests, residual patches and burned matrices. Temporal, disturbance
   severity, spatial and structural variables of habitats were also
   recorded. Bryophyte community composition differed among habitat types
   with residual patches characterized by higher species richness, the loss
   of forest specialists and the addition of disturbance-prone species. The
   bryophyte community found in residual patches is at the interface
   between the communities of undisturbed forests and burned matrices. As
   residual patches did not conserve all species, particularly forest
   specialists, they were not refugia. However, we identify temporal,
   spatial and structural characteristics that can maintain bryophyte
   communities most similar to undisturbed forests and enhance residual
   patch ``refugia potential{''}. Residual patches enhance bryophyte
   diversity of the landscape housing species that cannot survive in the
   burned matrix. As conclusion we discuss the use of retention patches in
   harvested stands, together with the preservation of undisturbed stands
   that house singular bryophyte communities and especially sensitive
   forest specialists.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Increasing densities of woody plants in savannas has been attributed to
   both elevated atmospheric CO2 and reduced burning with grazing
   management, such that the biome could represent a substantial carbon
   sink. However, we show that extreme droughts (less than two-thirds
   expected rainfall over 3 years) occur in the drier half of the savanna
   biome and can cause substantial tree death. An Australian case study
   reveals that a net increase in tree cover over five decades of
   above-average rainfall was offset by sudden tree death during drought.
   The relationship between woody cover change and rainfall is moderated by
   competition with growth being facilitated by low woody cover and
   drought-induced death more likely as the woody component of savanna
   increases. The results are not supportive of a sustained increase in the
   woody component of xeric savannas resulting from CO2 fertilization or
   land management. Extensive tree death in savanna regions will become a
   stark consequence of climate change if predictions of increasing
   severity and frequency of drought are realized.}},

Abstract = {{The 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park provided an opportunity to
   study effects of a large infrequent disturbance on a natural community.
   This study addressed two questions: (1) How does prefire heterogeneity
   of the landscape affect postfire patterns of fire severity? and (2) How
   do postfire patterns of burn severity influence plant reestablishment?
   At three sites, 100 sampling points were distributed regularly in a 1-km
   x 1-km grid and sampled annually from 1989 to 1992. Information was
   recorded on fire severity (damage to trees, depth of ash and soil
   charring, and percent mineral soil exposed); pre-fire forest structure
   (forest successional stage; tree density; toe species; tree size; and
   evidence of pre-fire disturbance by mountain pine beetle {[}Dendroctonus
   ponderosae Hopk.] or mistletoe {[}Arceuthobium americanum Nutt. ex
   Engelm.]); postfire percent cover of graminoids, forbs, and low shrubs;
   number of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.)
   seedlings; and general topographic characteristics (slope and aspect).
   Fire severity was influenced by successional stage, with older stands
   more likely to be in the more severe burn class, and by tree diameter,
   with tree damage diminishing with tree size. Prefire bark beetle and
   mistletoe damage also influenced fire severity: severe prefire damage
   increased the likelihood of crown fire, but intermediate prefire damage
   reduced the likelihood of crown fire. Fire severity was not influenced
   by slope, aspect, or tree density. Postfire percent vegetative cover and
   density of lodgepole pine seedlings varied with burn severity. In
   lightly burned areas, percent cover returned to unburned levels by 1991.
   In severely burned areas, total percent cover was about half that of
   unburned areas by 1992, and shrub cover remained reduced. Recruitment of
   lodgepole pine seedlings was greatest during the second postfire year
   and in severe-surface burns rather than in crown fires. Continued
   monitoring of vegetation dynamics in Yellowstone's burned forests will
   contribute to our understanding of successional processes following a
   disturbance that was exceptional in its size and severity.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Abstract = {{Termites, herbivores and fire are recognized as major guilds that
   structure woody plant communities in African savanna and woodland
   ecosystems. An understanding of their interaction is crucial to design
   appropriate management regimes. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   the long-term impacts of herbivore, fire and termite activities on
   regeneration of trees. Permanent experimental quadrats were established
   in 1992 in the Sudanian woodland of Burkina Faso subjected to grazing by
   livestock and annual early fire and the control. Within the treatment
   quadrats, an inventory of the woody undergrowth community was conducted
   on termitaria occupied by Macrotermes subhyalinus, extended
   termitosphere (within 5 m radius from the mound base) and adjacent area
   (beyond 5 m from the mound base). Hierarchical analysis was performed to
   determine significant differences in species richness, abundance and
   diversity indices among vegetation patches within fire and herbivory
   treatments. Grazed quadrats had significantly (P < 0.001) more species
   and stem density of woody undergrowth than non-grazed quadrats but
   maintained similar level of species richness and stem density of woody
   undergrowth on termitaria. There were not significant differences
   (P>0.05) in species richness and stem density between burnt and unburnt
   quadrats. Termitaria supported a highly diverse woody undergrowth with
   higher stem density than either the extended termitosphere or rest of
   quadrats. The density of woody undergrowth was significantly related
   with mature trees of selected species on termitaria (R-2 = 0.593;
   P<0.001) than that on the extended termitosphere (R-2 = 0.333; P<0.001)
   and adjacent area (R-2 = 0.197; P<0.001). It can be concluded that
   termites facilitate the regeneration of woody species while grazing and
   annual early fire play a minor role in the regeneration of woody
   species. The current policy that prohibits grazing should be revised to
   accommodate the interests of livestock herders. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{Over a century of fire suppression in warm/dry mixed conifer forests of
   southwestern Colorado, USA has resulted in changes that have disrupted
   feedback interactions between vegetation composition and structure and
   the accompanying natural fire regime. The ecosystem is now more
   susceptible to high intensity crown fires that were previously rare or
   absent in this forest type, which can lead to novel ecosystems. We
   established four replicated blocks of (1) thin/burn. (2) burn alone and
   (3) control treatments, each approximately 16-ha, to quantify the
   effects of restoration treatments on forest structure. We sampled in
   2003 (pre-treatment) and in 2009 (post-treatment). There were no
   significant changes in the control and burn alone treatments for tree
   density, basal area, canopy cover and tree regeneration between pre-and
   post-treatment. Significant changes in the thin/burn treatments
   included: tree density declining 82\% (582.7 trees ha(-1)), principally
   white fir and Douglas-fir; tree canopy cover decreasing 36\%; basal area
   declining 49\% (12.5 m(2)ha(-1)), primarily from white fir; aspen tree
   regeneration increasing by 362\% (582.7 trees ha(-1)), and white fir
   regeneration decreasing by 94\% (249.1 trees ha(-1)). Overstory trees
   that died tended to be younger, shorter, and/or smaller in diameter.
   Multivariate analysis of tree basal area by species in the thin/burn
   treatments in 2009 showed a strong directional shift away from 2003
   pretreatment data towards the reconstructed historical (1870) forest
   structure. Burn alone treatments were distinct from controls after
   treatment in 2009 but did not resemble reconstructed 1870 forest
   structure. Thin/burn treatments moved warm/dry mixed conifer forests in
   southwestern Colorado rapidly along the trajectory toward historical
   reference conditions by altering forest composition and structure. Burn
   alone treatments were less effective but also less costly. Forest
   restoration will make forests more resilient to stand-replacing fires
   and subsequent transitions to novel ecosystems under a warmer, drier
   climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{446}},

Abstract = {{The southeastern U.S. is considered the ``wood-basket{''} of the world
   where loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations provide tremendous
   ecological and economic benefits to the region. These plantations are
   susceptible to various natural and anthropogenic abiotic and biotic
   stressors and disturbances. The southern pine engravers, Ips avulsus
   (Eichhoff), I. calligraphus (Germar), and I. grandicollis (Eichhoff),
   are considered secondary colonizers of stressed, damaged, and dying
   loblolly pines. However, they may undergo outbreaks and colonize live
   pine hosts if environmental conditions cause physiological stress to
   trees. In 2016, > 230 concurrent Ips infestations > 2 ha in size were
   documented in Georgia, U.S., reportedly due to severe drought. In these
   forests, prescribed burning is often conducted every 2-3 years to reduce
   fuel-loads, improve wildlife habitat, and manage understory vegetation.
   However, the effects of low-severity prescribed fire on active southern
   Ips infestations are unknown; fire may exacerbate or alleviate beetle
   outbreaks. Our objectives were to: (1) compare Ips infestations between
   burned and unburned sites to determine the short-term effects of
   prescribed fire on loblolly pine mortality; and (2) determine which
   site-level and tree-level variables were the best predictors of
   short-term levels of tree mortality. We monitored 838 pines on ten sites
   for eight months following prescribed fire in spring 2017. Overall, 69
   (8\%) trees died with 3.6 times higher tree mortality on unburned sites,
   and a higher probability of survival on burned sites. At the site-level,
   binomial logistic regression models including treatment (unburned versus
   burned) and time since burn were the best predictors of loblolly pine
   mortality. At the tree-level, model selection showed that treatment,
   crown mortality level (1-5), Ips activity level (none, low, medium, and
   high), and tree diameter provided the best predictions of mortality.
   Prescribed burning may thus help alleviate pest pressure and increase
   tree resilience in loblolly pine forests in the southeastern U.S.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{709-720}},
Abstract = {{Altered fire regimes play a key role in shrub expansion in grasslands
   worldwide. We assessed how season and type or intensity of fire affected
   the growth and demography of Rhus glabra, a common woody invader in
   North American mesic grasslands. Fire during any season killed 99\% of
   ramets but stimulated new ramet recruitment from belowground buds,
   resulting in a near-complete turnover of ramet populations. During the
   first 2 years following fire, populations on spring-burned sites had the
   greatest post-fire ramet densities and population growth rates, and
   winter-and spring-burned populations showed the highest resprouting
   rates. However, after 10 years, R. glabra cover on summer-burned sites
   was 3.5 times greater than on autumn-or winter-burned treatments. Thus,
   short-term post-fire responses may not be good predictors of long-term
   changes in abundance. Low-intensity spring backfires resulted in the
   highest ramet population growth rates, whereas high-intensity headfires
   in any season resulted in slower growth, and populations burned with
   low-intensity winter fires declined. In addition, season of fire
   influenced browsing pressure, suggesting that plant responses may be
   partially a result of indirect effects of fire on rates of herbivory.
   Overall, our results demonstrate that the application of frequent autumn
   or winter backfires is an effective management tool for limiting R.
   glabra expansion in grasslands, and that long-term data are critical for
   management decision-making, particularly in systems characterised by
   high interannual climate variability.}},

Abstract = {{Plant growth promoting microbes impact the life of trees, shrubs and
   other plant species in the forest. Fire in forest adversely affects the
   growth of plants directly by burning and heat stress and indirectly by
   affecting the survival of plant growth promoting microbes. Herein, we
   analyzed changes in the population of cultivable microbes owing to fire
   in the pine grown forest in the Indian Himalayan region. We found that
   soil in the burnt region predominantly harbored Gram-positive bacteria
   which lacked biofertilizer and biocontrol traits. Forest fire resulted
   in the loss of Gram-negative strains of genera Pseudomonas, Serratia,
   Enterobacter, Burkholderia, Klebsiella, and Pantoea. Similarly, we found
   that the rhizospheric region of grasses which came after the event of
   the fire in the pine forest lacked the beneficial Gram-negative strains.
   Furthermore, in plantae experiments in which pea (Pisum sativum) and
   wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings were treated with bacteria isolated
   from the burnt and unburnt forest bed showed that bacteria from the
   burnt region did not affect the growth of seedlings as compared to the
   bacteria isolated from the unburnt region which improved the growth of
   seedlings. Comparing the soil parameters between burnt and unburnt
   region showed a decrease in nutrients, and, increase in both bulk
   density and dispersion ratio due to the forest fire. Our results
   strongly indicate that forest fire reduces the population of cultivable
   beneficial microbes and this loss could have a negative impact on the
   growth of forest flora.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary successional vegetation represents one-third of the 7\% of the
   original area covered with tropical dry forest that remains in central
   Veracruz, Mexico. In this region, fallow periods are short, in general,
   no longer than 7-10 years, and old secondary successional sites are not
   available. Therefore we evaluated the potential of very early
   successional stages of tropical dry forest with different land use
   histories for recovering the structure and composition of regional
   forest. We compared five early successional sites (7-72 months) with
   five nearby forest remnants. Successional sites had reached 38 and 30\%,
   respectively, of the average basal area and density recorded for the
   forest understories, but only 5 and 10\%, respectively, of the basal
   area and density of forest overstories. A total of 132 tree species were
   recorded, 45 at successional and 107 at forest sites. Individuals of
   tree species with animal-dispersed seeds (57\%) were significantly
   better represented than wind-dispersed (22\%) and self-dispersing (21\%)
   species in both successional and forest sites. Successional sites had
   already recruited 10\% of the intermediate and shade-tolerant species
   that grow in forest remnants. However, only 20 species occurred in both
   early successional and forest sites, several showing resprouting
   ability. We conclude that the entry of forest species to the
   successional process at very early stages and the recruitment of
   individuals from resprouting may facilitate the recovery of the dry
   forest in Veracruz.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance by fire in the Succulent Karoo is rare but fire events could
   increase as a result of an increase in grassiness (alien and indigenous
   species). This study assessed the effects of fire eight years after an
   experimentally induced burn in Succulent Karoo vegetation. Post-fire
   monitoring was conducted using the line intercept method and species
   counts per plot (1 m(2)) for each of three fire disturbance treatments:
   control/unburnt, high and low fuel load. Vegetation cover and abundance
   were compared across treatments and growth forms. Vegetation cover and
   abundance on fire-disturbed plots had not returned to pre-fire levels
   after eight years. Resprouters exhibited a rapid recovery and early
   dominance on burnt plots. Succulent seedlings established slower, but
   after eight years occurred at higher densities on the burnt than control
   plots. Recovery after disturbance of density and cover of long-lived,
   woody non-resprouter non-succulents was slow relative to resprouting
   non-succulents and reseeding succulents. This study of vegetation change
   following fire disturbance in an arid system highlights the slow return
   of canopy cover, immediate regrowth of only two resprouter species and
   slower re-establishment by seed of non-resprouter species. In addition,
   fire disturbance led to the numerical dominance of succulents within the
   first decade after the fire.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fire is one of the most important ecological disturbances

   8 radio-tagged California spotted owls whose home ranges included forest
   burned in the 5,176-ha Slide Fire in the San Bernardino Mountains,
   California, USA. We analyzed foraging habitat selection with sensitivity
   analysis using 3 different spatial extents to define available resource
   area: utilization distribution, minimum convex polygon, and capture
   radius. At all 3 extents of available habitat these spotted owls
   selected foraging sites close to their territory centers and riparian
   areas. Resource selection functions indicated burned forests were
   generally used in proportion to their availability, with the exception
   of significant selection for moderate-severity burned forests farther
   from territory centers at the largest available habitat extent (capture
   radius). Riparian habitats should be preserved for California spotted
   owls in southern California, and forests burned by high-severity fire
   should be considered potentially suitable foraging habitat. We suggest
   researchers perform habitat selection analyses at multiple spatial
   extents of availability and describe the sensitivity of their results.

Abstract = {{The Battle Creek watershed in northern California was historically
   important for its Chinook salmon populations, now at remnant levels due
   to land and water uses. Privately owned portions of the watershed are
   managed primarily for timber production, which has intensified since
   1998, when clearcutting became widespread. Turbidity has been monitored
   by citizen volunteers at 13 locations in the watershed. Approximately
   2000 grab samples were collected in the 5-year analysis period as
   harvesting progressed, a severe wildfire burned 11,200ha, and most of
   the burned area was salvage logged. The data reveal strong associations
   of turbidity with the proportion of area harvested in watersheds
   draining to the measurement sites. Turbidity increased significantly
   over the measurement period in 10 watersheds and decreased at one. Some
   of these increases may be due to the influence of wildfire, logging
   roads and haul roads. However, turbidity continued trending upwards in
   six burned watersheds that were logged after the fire, while decreasing
   or remaining the same in two that escaped the fire and post-fire
   logging. Unusually high turbidity measurements (more than seven times
   the average value for a given flow condition) were very rare (0.0\% of
   measurements) before the fire but began to appear in the first year
   after the fire (5.0\% of measurements) and were most frequent (11.6\% of
   measurements) in the first 9 months after salvage logging. Results
   suggest that harvesting contributes to road erosion and that current
   management practices do not fully protect water quality.}},

   Analytical framework and case studies in the United States}},
Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{More than 50\% of water supplies in the conterminous United States
   originate on forestland or rangeland and are potentially under
   increasing stress as a result of larger and more severe wildfires.
   Little is known, however, about the long-term impacts of fire on annual
   water yield and the role of climate variability within this context. We
   here propose a framework for evaluating wildland fire impacts on
   streamflow that combines double-mass analysis with new methods (change
   point analysis, climate elasticity modeling, and process-based modeling)
   to distinguish between multiyear fire and climate impacts. The framework
   captures a wide range of fire types, watersheds characteristics, and
   climate conditions using streamflow data, as opposed to other approaches
   requiring paired watersheds. The process is illustrated with three case
   studies. A watershed in Arizona experienced a +266\% increase in annual
   water yield in the 5years after a wildfire, where +219\% was attributed
   to wildfire and +24\% to precipitation trends. In contrast, a California
   watershed had a lower (-64\%) post-fire net water yield, comprised of
   enhanced flow (+38\%) attributed to wildfire offset (-102\%) by lower
   precipitation in the post-fire period. Changes in streamflow within a
   watershed in South Carolina had no apparent link to periods of
   prescribed burning but matched a very wet winter and reports of storm
   damage. The presented framework is unique in its ability to detect and
   quantify fire or other disturbances, even if the date or nature of the
   disturbance event is uncertain, and regardless of precipitation trends.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass burning has attracted great concerns for the emission of
   particular matters and trace gases, which substantially impacts air
   quality, human health, and climate change. Meanwhile, large areas of
   dark char, carbon residue produced in incomplete combustion, can stick
   to the surface over fire-prone areas after open burning, leading to a
   sharp drop in surface albedo, so-called ``surface darkening{''}.
   However, exploration into such surface albedo declines and the radiative
   and meteorological effects is still fairly limited. As one of the
   highest-yield agricultural areas, eastern China features intensive straw
   burning every early summer, the harvest season for winter wheat, which
   was particularly strong in 2012. Satellite retrievals show that the
   surface albedo decline over fire-prone areas was significant, especially
   in the near-infrared band, which can reach -0.16. Observational evidence
   of abnormal surface warming was found by comparing radiosonde and
   reanalysis data. Most sites around intensive burned scars show a
   positive deviation, extending especially in the downwind area.
   Comparisons between ``pre-fire{''} and ``post-fire{''} from 2007 to 2015
   indicated a larger temperature bias of the forecast during the post-fire
   stage. The signal becomes more apparent between 14:00 and 20:00 LT.
   Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem)
   simulations suggest that including surface darkening can decrease model
   bias and well-captured temperature variation after burning at sites in
   fire areas and their adjacent area. This work highlights the importance
   of biomass burning induced albedo change in weather forecast and
   regional climate.}},

Abstract = {{Fremontodendron decumbens grows in a single county in central
   California, USA. Prior research showed that its elaiosome-bearing seeds

   hypotheses regarding the positive role of ant-mediated dispersal to F.
   decumbens: (1) Does ant-mediated seed dispersal facilitate seed escape
   from rodent predation?: (2) Does ant processing of seeds stimulate
   germination?; (3) Are ant middens more suitable microsites for seed or
   seedling survival in unburned chaparral areas?; and (4) Do survival
   benefits of dispersal occur post-fire in the form of differences in
   seedling survival probabilities and, if so. why? Results of tests of
   each hypothesis were: (1) similar percentages of seeds placed on ant
   middens and under F. decumbens shrub canopies were destroyed by rodents,
   but seeds from which elaiosomes had been removed were more likely to
   escape rodent predation: (2) seeds processed by ants did not germinate
   more readily than seeds removed directly from shrub branches; (3)
   seedling predation was a major cause of mortality in unburned chaparral
   on both ant middens and under shrubs, and overall seedling survival did
   not differ between the two microsites: (4) post-burn seedling survival
   was significantly greater for seedlings dispersed away from F. decumbens
   shrub canopies, because dispersed seedlings were both less likely to be
   killed by predators and more likely to be growing in a gap created by
   the fire-caused death of an established shrub. I concluded that the
   major ecological benefit to F. decumbens of ant-mediated seed dispersal

Abstract = {{Southwestern USA ponderosa pine (Pin us ponderosa C. Lawson var.
   scopulorum Engelm.) forests evolved with frequent surface fires and have
   changed dramatically over the last century. Overstory tree density has
   sharply increased while abundance of understory vegetation has declined
   primarily due to the near cessation of fires. We examined effects of
   varying prescribed fire-return intervals (1,2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years,
   plus unburned) on the abundance and composition of understory vegetation
   in 2007 and 2008 after 30+ years of fall prescribed burning at two
   ponderosa pine sites. We found that after 30 years, overstory canopy
   cover remained high, while understory plant canopy cover was low,
   averaging <12\% on all burn intervals. We attributed the weak understory
   response to a few factors - the most important of which was the high
   overstory cover at both sites. Graminoid cover and cover of the major
   grass species, Elymus elymoides (squirreltail), increased on shorter
   fire-return intervals compared to unburned plots, but only at one site.
   Community composition differed significantly between shorter fire-return
   intervals and unburned plots at one site, but not the other. For several
   response variables, precipitation levels appeared to have a stronger
   effect than treatments. Our findings suggest that low-severity burn
   treatments in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, especially those that
   do not decrease overstory cover, are minimally effective in increasing
   understory plant cover. Thinning of these dense forests along with
   prescribed burning is necessary to increase cover of understory
   vegetation. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-evergreen forests of central coastal California are being severely
   impacted by the recently introduced plant pathogen, Phytophthora
   ramorum. We collected forest plot data using a multi-scale sampling
   design to characterize pre-infestation forest composition and ongoing
   tree mortality along environmental and time-since-fire gradients.
   Vegetation pattern was described using trend surface analysis, spatial
   autocorrelation analysis and redundancy analysis. Species-environment
   associations were modeled using non-parametric multiplicative regression
   (NPMR). Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) mortality was analyzed with
   respect to environmental and biotic factors using trend surface analysis
   and multivariate regression. Mixed-evergreen forest occurs throughout
   the Big Sur region but is most widespread in the north, on north facing
   slopes, at mid-elevations near the coast. Relative basal area of the
   dominant tree species changes fairly predictably from north to south and
   from coast to interior in relation to mapped patterns of precipitation,
   temperature factors and soil characteristics. Most dominant tree species
   sprout vigorously after fire. The forests experience a mixed-fire regime
   in this region ranging from low severity understory burns to high
   severity crown fires, with the latter increasing above the marine
   inversion layer and at more interior locations. Ceanothus spp. can
   dominate mixed-evergreen sites for several decades after severe fires.
   All of the dominant broadleaf evergreen tree species are hosts of P.
   ramorum, although not all will die from infection. Tanoak mortality
   decreases from northwest to southeast and is significantly correlated
   with climate, especially growing degree days and mean annual
   precipitation, and with basal area of the foliar host bay laurel
   (Umbellularia californica) in a 0.5-1 ha neighborhood. Adaptive
   management of mixed-evergreen forest to mitigate P. ramorum impacts in
   the region will need to consider large local and regional variation in
   forest composition and the potentially strong interactions between
   climate, fire, forest composition and disease severity. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We assessed the effectiveness of forest fuel thinning projects that
   explicitly removed surface and ladder fuels (all but one were combined
   mechanical and prescribed fire/pile burn prescriptions) in reducing fire
   severity and tree mortality in 12 forest fires that burned in eastern
   and southern California between 2005 and 2011. All treatments and fires
   occurred in yellow pine or mixed conifer forests, in a variety of
   landscape conditions. Most fires burned under warm, dry conditions, with
   moderate to high winds. With few exceptions, fire severity measures
   (bole char height, scorch and torch height, scorch and torch percentage)
   and tree mortality were much lower in forest stands treated for fuels
   than in neighboring untreated stands. Fire-tolerant species like Pinus
   jeffreyi and Pinus ponderosa exhibited much higher postfire survivorship
   than fire-intolerant species like Abies concolor. Among variables
   related to fire weather, fuel loading, and treatment age, ten-hour fuel
   moisture was found to be a better predictor of tree survival in
   untreated stands than in treated stands, while fuel loading was a better
   predictor of survival in treated stands. We did not find an effect of
   treatment age, but our oldest treatments (nine years when burned) were
   below the mean pre-Euroamerican settlement fire return interval for
   these forest types. Within treatments, fire severity decreased with
   distance from the treatment boundary, and canopy fires were almost
   always reduced to surface fires within 70 m of entering the treatment.
   In California yellow pine and mixed conifer forests, treatment
   prescriptions should allow for levels of fire-driven canopy tree
   mortality (c. 5-15\%) that better mimic natural fires. Our results add
   significantly to the growing evidence that fuel treatments that include
   removal of surface and ladder fuels in these forest types are highly
   effective management tools for reducing fire severity and canopy tree
   mortality. In our opinion, quantitative assessments of fuel treatment
   effects on fire severity in frequent-fire forest types hardly merit
   further effort. Rather, we suggest that future work focus on documenting
   and comparing other ecological outcomes of fuel treatments in burned and
   unburned forest, such as effects on plant and animal diversity, soil
   conditions, and habitat heterogeneity. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   do Sul, Brazil. Per grassland site, 20 individuals each of 1-2 grassland
   shrub species (Asteraceae) and two forest tree species (Myrsinaceae,
   Myrtaceae) were tagged, and post-disturbance survival and growth
   monitored for 1 year at 2-4 month intervals. Differences in resprouting
   vigour (summed-up basal area of resprouted shoots per pre-disturbance
   summed-up area of basal stems), and in density and allometry of
   resprouted shoots (allocation mode) were compared between tree and shrub
   species by linear mixed effects modelling and multiple comparisons,
   using the Tukey test. All grassland shrub individuals resprouted and
   regained 73-142 \% (species average) of pre-disturbance basal area
   within one year, as opposed to 14-24 \% in trees. All Myrtaceae
   `gullivers' resprouted, but up to two-thirds of Myrsine individuals did
   not survive disturbance. Tree species tended to produce either many
   slender or few stout shoots, while shrub species were intermediate
   between these extremes. Forest trees regained 22-46 \% of
   pre-disturbance height, independent of allocation mode, and grassland
   shrubs up to 73 \%. This suggests that grassland fires allow grassland
   shrubs but not forest trees to persist and to grow to reproductive size.
   Differing sprout allocation modes may reflect allometric constraints
   rather than strategies to outgrow the fire-prone grass matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Savanna vegetation is characterized by high and variable ground layer
   species richness regulated by functional group interactions with fire
   regimes and canopy cover. Frequent fire selects for C4 grasses and
   prairie forbs in canopy openings and C3 graminoid species and
   shade-adapted forbs and shrubs in canopy shade. Frequent fire also
   maximizes heterogeneity in partial canopy cover and species richness
   across the full canopy gradient. However, few studies have linked fire
   induced change in tree canopy cover with groundlayer vegetation dynamics
   in relation to this model. In 1986 and in 2007, we measured canopy cover
   and sampled groundlayer vegetation in 1 m(2) plots along 53 transects at
   the Tefft Savanna, a fire managed 197 ha eastern sand savanna with
   strong canopy cover and elevation gradients. We analyzed temporal change
   in canopy cover and groundlayer vegetation, correlating percent change
   in canopy cover with change in ground layer functional groups. After 20
   years of burning at 3 fires/decade, elevation accounted for 62\% of the
   variation in an NMS ordination of groundlayer vegetation. However,
   canopy cover, which averaged 24-86\% in 2007, had a significant
   secondary effect on the ordination. Five vegetation types classified by
   TWINSPAN varied significantly in elevation and canopy cover. Woody
   vegetation comprised 8 of the 12 species with greatest niche breadths,
   and tended to predominant in woodland or forest, where tree cover
   averaged 50\% or more. Forbs had greater richness in savanna, which
   averaged less than 30\% canopy cover. The C3 sedge Carex pensylvanica
   was the dominant graminoid species under woodland canopy cover, and was
   co-dominant with the C4 grasses Andropogon scoparius and Sorghastrum
   nutans under savanna canopy cover. As in other savannas, N-fixing
   species sorted across shade and canopy openings, and heterogeneity among
   transects was maximized at mid-canopy cover. Over time, canopy cover
   decreased up to 50\%, creating more open savanna conditions at mid to
   high elevations. This decrease was associated with a 20-100 \% increase
   in species richness and was significantly correlated with increasing
   richness and cover of C4 grasses and summer flowering prairie and
   woodland forbs. These results support a canopy cover model of
   fire-maintained savanna vegetation, with greater abundance of C4 grasses
   and prairie forb species associated with lower canopy cover, greater
   heterogeneity at mid-canopy cover, and species richness maximized across
   the light gradient. They also indicate that decreasing canopy cover
   caused by repeated burning increases species richness and abundance of
   C4 and prairie forb species. (C) 2011 Elsevier RV. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding changes in copro-necrophagous beetle diversity related to

   diversity and assemblage structure in copro-necrophagous beetles under
   different livestock management systems in an anthropized tropical dry
   forest landscape in Mexico. We used a standard sampling protocol to
   capture copro-necrophagous beetles in three livestock management
   systems: silvopastoral systems with Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (SPS)
   associated with grasses, treeless pastures (monocultures) and managed
   tree fallows of tropical dry forest with livestock. We characterized the
   habitat structure, management practices and physico-chemical parameters
   of the soil in each system. We recorded a total of 1423 specimens
   belonging to 15 species. The results show a greater beetle species
   richness in the SPS with G. ulmifolia, which declines with reduced site
   complexity and soil quality and increased management practice intensity.
   There was a positive relationship between beetle species abundance and
   the soil physico-chemical characteristics such as moisture and nutrient
   content, as well as with the density of plants. A negative effect of
   management practices (use of insecticides, anti-parasite treatments and
   burning) was observed on beetle abundance; when the analyzed variables
   were related to each individual species, only four species responded to
   differences in levels of nitrogen and magnesium, as well as to the
   management practice and density of plants. Systems where perennial woody
   plants (trees and/or shrubs) interact with traditional components
   (animals and herbaceous forage plants) under integrated management can
   provide favorable conditions for the maintenance of a relatively high

Abstract = {{This study investigated emission factors (EFs) for CO2, CO, NO and
   carbonyls from laboratory-based combustion of five typical vegetation
   types of Western Australia. A range of combustion conditions was
   obtained by controlling the vegetation moisture content and air flow
   rate. CO2, CO and NO were measured using a multi-gas monitor MultiRAE.
   Six carbonyls were collected using 2,4-DNPH sorbent tubes and analysed
   using HPLC-UV.
   Burns of woodland (Banksia) and forest (Jarrah) had significantly higher
   EFCO, with lower modified combustion efficiency (MCE) than those of
   tropical grass (Spinifex). Temperate grass (Veldt) fires had lower EFCO2
   and higher EFCO and EFcarbonyls, and a much lower MCE than those of the
   tropical grass fires. EFNO were similar for woodland, forest and
   tropical grass but large differences in EFNO were observed for Spinifex
   and Veldt grass. Formaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl emitted.
   Combustion conditions influenced the EFcarbonyls with larger EFs from
   burns with higher fuel moisture contents and/or at higher flow rates.
   Functions to extrapolate EFs for infrequently measured carbonyls
   (acetaldehyde, acetone and propionaldehyde) from EFformaldehyde were
   developed. The EFCO2 and EFCO were similar to values reported from field
   measurements for similar ecosystems in Australia, indicating the
   applicability of these laboratory-based results. EFs for other gases
   differed to those reported from bushfires in other parts of the world
   suggesting that to improve prediction of bushfire emissions and impacts

Abstract = {{Wildfires affect ecosystems depending on the fire regime. Long-term
   studies are needed to understand the ecological role played by fire,
   especially as regards its impact on soils. The aim of this study is to
   monitor the long-term effects (18 years) of a wildfire on soil
   properties in two areas affected by low and high fire severity regimes.
   The properties studied were total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), C/N
   ratio, soil organic matter (SOM) and extractable calcium (Ca), magnesium
   (Mg), sodium (Na) and potassium (K). The study was carried out in three
   phases: short- (immediately after the wildfire), medium- (seven years
   after the wildfire) and long-term (18 years after the wildfire). The
   results showed that in both fire regimes TN decreased with time, TC and
   SOM were significantly lower in the burned plots than they were in the
   control in the medium-and long-terms. C/N ratio was significantly lower
   at short-term in low wildfire severity area. Extractable Ca and Mg were
   significantly higher in control plot than in the burned plots in the
   medium-term. In the long-term, extractable Ca and Mg were significantly
   lower in the area exposed to a high severity burning. No differences
   were identified in the case of extractable Na between plots on any of
   the sampling dates, while extractable K was significantly higher in the
   plot exposed to low wildfire than it was in the control. Some
   restoration measures may be required after the wildfire, especially in
   areas affected by high severity burning, to avoid the long-term impacts
   on the essential soil nutrients of TC, SOM, extractable Ca and Mg. This
   long-term nutrient depletion is attributable to vegetation removal,
   erosion, leaching and post-fire vegetation consumption. Soils clearly
   need more time to recover from wildfire disturbance, especially in areas
   affected by high severity fire regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Composts are frequently used to restore various degraded lands
   especially after fire. We investigated how different organic amendments
   after frequent wildfires can affect soil microbial functions. We crossed
   three times since fire (1, 5 and 18 years) with three different compost
   qualities (i.e. young, intermediate and old). After 5 months, alkaline
   phosphatase increased by the intermediate compost in early post-fire
   chronosequence (1 and 5 year after fires). This increase was confirmed
   10 months after amendment with the three composts but only for the most
   recent fire. The net nitrification increased 5 months after amendment
   under both the young and intermediate composts in the 5 and 18 years of
   time since fire plots. This increase was confirmed 10 months after
   amendment with the intermediate and old compost treatments for the 1 and
   5 years of time since fire plots. In this case, compost amendment even
   induced positive nitrification rates for the 5 years of time since fire
   plots. Moreover, older composts affected catabolic diversity after 5
   months, whereas at the same time, we detected an increase in biomass of
   cultivable bacteria. Urease activity gradually increased with the age of
   composts after 10 months. beta-glucosidase activity increased under the
   young and intermediate composts and did not change with the older. This
   study suggests compost addition can result in an artificial acceleration
   of the nutrient cycles. Thus organic amendments in burned ecosystems
   should be reasoned according to both the step of the Mediterranean
   post-fire recovery and the quality of organic amendments. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing use of fire in managing oak woodlands, little
   information exists on quantitative changes to stand structure from
   prescribed burning. Fire damage and recovery in a mixed deciduous oak
   woodland were recorded after a prescribed fire on the northern Diablo
   Range, Santa Clara County, California. Blue oak (Quercus douglasii Hook.
   \& Arn.), valley oak (Q. lobata Nee), and black oak (Q. kelloggii Newb.)
   trees were monitored for 4 yr to determine the effects of a late spring
   burn on stand structural characteristics. Fire-caused mortality was low;
   4 yr after the low intensity ground fire only four oaks died (1.9\%).
   There were significant differences in mean percent tree crown scorch and
   mean trunk char height between plots that burned under different fire
   intensities, but not between tree size classes. Although overall tree
   damage was low, crown resprouts developed on 80\% of the trees and were
   found as shortly as 2 wk after the fire. Recovery was vigorous; both
   valley oaks and blue oaks produced crown resprouts on trees with 100\%
   crown scorch. Classification tree analysis identified aspect (mostly
   southern exposures) and tree size related to the presence of crown
   resprouting. Crown damage was also an important factor; trees with
   greater than 40\% of their crown scorched resprouted. Fire-induced trunk
   scars occurred on a small number of trees (9.1\%) but was
   disproportionately higher for black oak compared to blue and valley oak.
   Stand structural characteristics (species composition, tree density,
   basal area, and crown closure) were not substantially altered by the
   event but rather maintained. Prescribed fire might be a viable tool in
   reducing fuels and maintaining oak woodlands; however, further
   investigations that include relationships of regeneration with repeated
   fire are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Shortly after Liwonde National Park was gazetted in 1973, the influence
   of fire and elephant foraging was expected to be the priority management
   consideration. A number of permanent woodland plots were established,
   including a 200x10 m belt transect in open mixed woodland. All woody
   plants >1.5 m high were individually followed individually over the
   37-year study. Declines in canopy tree numbers (58\%) and species losses
   (7 of 19) were gradual throughout the period. Mean physical
   characteristics such as height, stem basal area and canopy cover were
   either stable (height) or increased slowly through the first three
   sample periods, with notable gains in the last 16 years. In spite of the
   substantial decline in the number of individuals, growth of the
   surviving larger trees compensated for these losses until 2014. During
   the first 21 years, upper canopy tree loss through fire remained stable
   at 0.8 trees/year. Over the last 16 years mean annual fire losses was
   1.1 trees/year with five trees lost in 2015. Elephant damage through
   `pushovers' remained very low at 0.3 trees/year up to 1999. With
   increasing elephant numbers this increased to 1.1 trees/year, reaching
   5.0 trees/year in 2015. All pushovers were ultimately killed by fire.
   Elephant foraging had a strong synergistic effect on fire mortality.
   Tree species remain in the shrub layer as rootstock or fire suffrutices.

   die out. Damage and mortality at this intensity will eventually reduce
   this woodland to tall dense grassland with scattered large trees.}},

Abstract = {{Understory fires are important for the maintenance of pine savanna
   ecosystems of the southeastern U.S., which contain high biodiversity and
   numerous federally endangered species. Prescribed burns are administered
   to maintain the open structure of pine savannas, conserve biodiversity,
   and to reduce wildfire hazard. However, relatively little research has
   examined which factors control the effects of prescribed burns on mature
   trees, and how responses might be altered by changing climate. The
   impact of prescribed burning on growth responses is likely to vary by
   tree species and by environmental conditions. To test the importance of
   these factors, tree cores were taken from mature Pinus palustris and
   Pinus serotina individuals at multiple locations across Fort Bragg, NC,
   a military preserve with detailed records on prescribed burn history
   dating back to 1991. Individual trees were sampled along the hydrologic
   gradient from xeric uplands to streamside wetlands. Annual growth was
   modeled as a function of species identity, hydrologic position, fire
   history, and climate conditions. We determined that prescribed burning
   produced a moderate decline in annual growth indicating that stress from
   prescribed burns outweighs benefits from increased water and nutrient
   availability. We found that the negative effects from prescribed burning
   were diminished or reversed during warmer years, and that the model
   predicts potential increases in growth during burn years under
   anticipated climate change scenarios. Surprisingly, there were no
   significant differences in growth rate by species or hydrologic
   position. Together these findings suggest that while prescribed burns
   may have minor, short-term impacts on tree growth under most current
   conditions, these effects are small enough that they are unlikely to
   outweigh the many benefits of this management technique for other
   aspects of ecosystem structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Woody encroachment into grasslands is occurring across the world and is
   of concern to land managers. Studies of forest-grassland boundaries have
   informed models describing factors that govern tree establishment and
   the maintenance and origin of grassland ecosystems. Central to these
   models is the role of fire relative to bottom up' resources such as soil
   and the geological substrate in determining the extent of grassland and
   forest in the landscape. The view that human lit fires have shaped
   vegetation across the Australian continent has been bolstered by early
   19th century observations of Aboriginal-set fires in Tasmanian montane
   grasslands and the documented encroachment of trees into these
   grasslands in the 20th century. We examined the pattern of lateral
   encroachment of woolly tea-tree (Leptospermum lanigerum (Sol. ex Aiton)
   Sm.) into these grasslands and used tree ring chronologies to
   investigate (i) past fire activity and (ii) how the geological substrate
   mediates growth rates of L.lanigerum. Changes in fire regimes inferred
   from L.lanigerum recruitment were corroborated by historical records.
   Encroachment (and increases in woody cover) of trees into grasslands was
   highest on granitic substances, although L.lanigerum growth rates were
   highest on basalt substrates, followed by conglomerate, granite and
   Mathinna sediments. Frequent burning up to the 1980s may have stymied
   the encroachment of trees in grasslands underlain by basalt. Growth
   rates decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge. This may
   be due to incremental changes in soil resources, grass competition
   and/or microclimate. The dynamics between grasslands and forests in
   montane Tasmania are consistent with tree growth-fire interaction models
   that highlight the interplay of edaphic factors, growth rates and fire
   history. Such complexity cautions against generalizations concerning the
   direct effects of landscape fire in shaping vegetation distribution
   across Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Invasions by nonnative plants have changed the structure of many
   terrestrial ecosystems and altered important ecological processes such
   as fire, the dominant driver in grassland ecosystems. Reestablishing
   fire has been proposed as a mechanism to restore dominance of native
   plants in grasslands invaded by nonnative plants, yet fire may function
   differently in these altered systems, potentially affecting animals in
   novel ways. To assess whether invasions by nonnative plants alter the
   effects of fire on animals, we performed a manipulative experiment in
   semi-desert grasslands of southeastern Arizona that have been invaded by
   a perennial, nonnative grass from Africa, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis
   lehmanniana). We applied fire to 36 of 54 1-ha plots established along
   an invasion gradient where dominance of E. lehmanniana ranged from 0\%
   to 91\% of total live plant biomass. Over the 5-year period from 2000 to
   2004, we used mark-recapture methods to assess how population and
   community attributes of small mammals varied along the gradient of
   nonnative grass and in response to fire. We quantified changes in
   presence of 17 species, abundance of 9 species, total abundance of all
   species combined, species richness, and species composition. Based on
   11,226 individual mammals from 24 species, we found that effects of
   nonnative-grass dominance varied with habitat preferences of each
   species, resulting in composition of the small-mammal community changing
   predictably along the invasion gradient. As dominance of nonnative grass
   increased, presence and abundance of granivorous heteromyids and
   insectivores (e. g., Chaetodipus, Perognathus, Onychomys; pocket mice
   and grasshopper mice) decreased, whereas presence and abundance of
   omnivorous and herbivorous murids (e. g., Reithrodontomys, Sigmodon;
   harvest mice and cotton rats) increased. Species richness of the
   small-mammal community averaged 8.4 species per plot and was highest at
   intermediate levels of nonnative-grass dominance where vegetation
   heterogeneity was greatest. Abundance of all small mammals combined
   averaged 26.9 individuals per plot and did not vary appreciably with
   nonnative-grass dominance. During the 4- to 8-week period immediately
   after fire, abundance of 6 of the 9 most common species changed, with 5
   species decreasing and 1 species increasing on burned plots relative to
   unburned plots. During this same time period, species richness of small
   mammals decreased by an average of 3 species (38\%) and total abundance
   of all species combined decreased by an average of 16 individuals (61\%)
   on burned plots relative to unburned plots. Effects of fire on
   vegetation biomass, on presence of 9 of 17 mammalian species, and on
   abundance of 4 of 9 mammalian species remained evident >= 2 years after
   fire. Effects of fire on most small-mammal species varied with the
   degree of nonnative-grass dominance, suggesting that fire functioned
   differently in areas invaded by nonnative plants relative to areas
   dominated by native plants. Specifically, effects of fire on presence of
   12 of 14 species and abundance of 7 of 9 species varied along the
   gradient of E. lehmanniana. During this post-fire period, however,
   composition of the small-mammal community in areas dominated by
   nonnative grass transitioned towards composition of areas dominated by
   native grasses, suggesting that fires had some restorative effect on
   habitat for small mammals. The relative strength of this effect will
   likely depend in general on the structural and compositional contrasts
   between invaded and native plant communities.
   Despite the reported neffectiveness of fire at reducing dominance of
   nonnative plants, restoring fire to grasslands invaded by nonnative
   plants can help maintain the mosaic of vegetation conditions necessary
   to support the diverse assemblage of animals that inhabit these
   fire-governed ecosystems. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Common ecological restoration treatments such as thinning trees and
   prescribed burning could result in changes to soil fungal communities
   and changes to the function of those communities. Ectomycorrhizal fungi
   are especially likely to be affected as they are symbionts on plant
   roots and exhibit host and niche preferences. Ectomycorrhizal fungi also
   produce extracellular enzymes that are important in soil nutrient
   cycling. We conducted a community survey of ectomycorrhizal fungi and
   assayed ectomycorrhizal root tip enzyme activity using substrate plugs
   in northern Mississippi upland oak-pine woodland plots differing in
   restoration history to explore the influence of woodland restoration on
   ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and function. Restoration
   treatment was significant in explaining the occurrence of the most
   common fungal species (Russula xerampelina) and the most common family
   (Thelephoraceae) in the ectomycorrhizal fungal community survey. Highest
   potential laccase, peroxidase, and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase
   enzyme activity were found in a prescribed burn plot, and the lowest
   enzyme activities at a wildfire plot, where richness of ectomycorrhizal
   fungi was also lower. Different fungal families displayed significantly
   different enzymatic capabilities, with Hydnangiaceae having the highest
   laccase activity and Tuberaceae having significantly higher peroxidase
   and chitinase activity than several other families. These results
   suggest that restoration treatments can affect ectomycorrhizal fungal
   community composition and function, and better understanding these
   changes can aid understanding of the niches of ectomycorrhizal fungi and
   the impacts of restoration.}},

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Increasing frequency and size of wildfires over the past few
   decades have prompted concerns that populations of obligate seeding
   species may be vulnerable to repeat, short-interval fires that occur
   prior to these species reaching maturity. The susceptibility of
   populations to this risk is partially dependent on the amount and
   characteristics of fuel loading over time and their influence on fire
   behavior and effects. This study characterized fuel dynamics and modeled
   fire behavior across a time-since-fire chronosequence in stands of the
   rare, serotinous conifer, Baker cypress (Hesperocyparis bakeri {[}Jeps.]
   Bartel), ranging in age between 3 and 147 years post fire. Results
   Litter and fine woody fuel loading (1- to 100-hour) were highest in the
   10-year-old and 147-year-old stands, while coarse fuel loading
   (1000-hour) peaked in the 10-year-old stand and subsequently decreased
   with time since fire. Duff loading consistently increased with time
   since fire. Cone production had not occurred in the first 10 yr of stand
   development. Foliar moisture content in Baker cypress was inversely
   correlated with stand age, and older foliage had lower moisture content
   than younger foliage. Modeled surface fire behavior was highest in the
   10-year-old and 107-year-old stands in accordance with higher litter,
   fine woody fuel, or shrub fuel accumulation. While foliar moisture
   content was higher in younger stands and influenced the critical
   fireline intensity, we did not observe changes in fire type. Conclusions
   Fine-fuel loading in Baker cypress stands followed a U-shaped pattern
   over time (first decreasing, then stable, then increasing), consistent
   with findings in other forests with stand-replacing fire regimes. Our
   results indicated that early-successional stages of Baker cypress
   forests have sufficient fuels to allow for the spread of wildfire and
   10-year-old stands could burn with substantive fire behavior prior to
   cone production. Whenever possible, we recommend suppressing wildfire in
   stands less than 20 yr old to avoid substantial decreases or local
   extirpation of these rare Baker cypress populations. Our results
   highlight the importance of knowing the cone production patterns, fuel
   dynamics, and corresponding fire behavior over the development of
   obligate-seeder species to assess the risk of population loss due to
   short-interval fires.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the abundance and diversity of vascular plants in seven
   types of disturbance in mixed-wood boreal forest. Disturbance treatments
   included wildfire, natural regeneration after harvest and several
   methods of silvicultural site preparation. Relative to undisturbed
   forest, all disturbance treatments increased plant diversity to about
   the same extent. The abundance of plant growth-forms differed
   significantly between disturbance treatments. Silvicultural treatments
   involving soil disturbance (disk-trenching, drum-chopping and blading)
   had higher cover of grasses and annual forbs; naturally regenerated and
   Bracke-cultivated treatments contained more perennial forbs and shrubs.
   Thus, different post-disturbance plant communities established following
   contrasting types of disturbance. Plant community biomass and tree
   growth varied among disturbance treatments. Shoot mass of aspen (Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) and the root mass of all species declined
   significantly with increasing soil disturbance intensity. Aspen and
   white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) differed in their response to
   disturbance. Aspen growth was similar among disturbance treatments. In
   contrast, aspen density was significantly lower in disk-trenched and
   bladed treatments than in burned or naturally regenerated treatments,
   and aspen basal area was significantly lower only in drum-chopped
   treatments. White spruce grew fastest in drum-chopped sites. Burned
   treatments had the highest recruitment of volunteer spruce seedlings (up
   to 3200 ha(-1)), but not significantly higher than in other disturbance
   treatments. Taken together these results suggest that the most intensive
   silvicultural treatments had the expected effects of reducing aspen
   abundance and increasing the growth of spruce, but also contained more
   grasses and forbs and had lower total root mass than burned or naturally
   regenerating sites. Further work is needed to examine long-term
   productivity and the persistence of both native and persistent weedy
   species following contrasting types of disturbance. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Despite historically dominating many landscapes of the southeastern
   United States, old-growth stands of southern pine (Pinus palustris, P.
   elliottii var. densa, P. elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii, P. echinata,
   and P. taeda) are extremely rare and have high ecological value, but may
   be underrepresented and mischaracterized due to small fragment size and
   restrictive definitions. Such misunderstanding is a barrier to future
   old-growth management and conservation. To quantify, characterize, and
   conserve these remnants, we conducted inventories for five species of
   old-growth southern pines on 16 sites across similar to 44,110 forested
   ha managed by the Florida Park Service. We used characteristics of
   old-growth pines and forests from the literature to locate potential
   sites and assess status and threats. This inventory documented 4697.5 ha
   of old-growth southern pines in 16 parks throughout Florida. The median
   size stand we inventoried or included due to existing documentation is
   121 ha, with stands as small as eight ha and as large as 2020 ha.
   Despite their small relative extent, these stands harbor rare,
   threatened, or endangered species and represent significant conservation
   areas in the region. A threat common to most of the old-growth stands in
   Florida State Parks is complications from reintroduction of prescribed
   fire following prolonged fire exclusion. Heavy fuel loading and invasion
   of off-site species has resulted in high post-fire mortality linked to
   both forest floor duff consumption and overstory crown consumption.
   Management measures are presented to improve conditions of old-growth

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{16-44}},
Abstract = {{The global boreal forests comprise large stocks of organic carbon that
   vary with climate and fire regimes. Global warming is likely to
   influence several aspects of fire and cause shifts in carbon
   sequestration patterns. Fire severity or forest floor depth of burn is
   one important aspect that influences both carbon emission during
   combustion as well as postfire ecosystem regeneration. Numerous
   publications on projections of future area burned exist, whereas
   scenarios on twenty-first century fire severity are more scarce, and the
   stand-typical response to severe fire weather is rarely taken into
   account. This paper aims to synthesize knowledge on boreal forest carbon
   stocks in relation to changes in fire severity for Quebec, Canada.
   Besides warming, this region may be subjected to an important increase
   in future precipitation. Future fire severity and area burned may well
   increase as fire weather will be drier, especially near the end of the
   twenty-first century. Moreover, the fire season peak may shift towards
   the late summer. Intense burning will favour tree cover development
   while the forest floor carbon stock may become less important. As a
   result, total Quebec boreal carbon sequestration may diminish. The
   development of dynamic vegetation models may improve scenarios on
   twenty-first century changes in carbon sequestration driven by climate
   change and fire severity and frequency effects.}},

Abstract = {{In ponderosa pine and mixed conifer ecosystems of the Southwestern US,
   regional-scale climate tends to synchronize fire years among study sites
   and increase fire extent or severity within a forest. At landscape
   scales (1-100 km(2)), fire frequency and severity may also be influenced
   by local-scale differences in elevation and aspect, including fire
   barriers in rugged terrain. This study examines local-scale and regional
   controls of past fire regimes in three tributary watersheds of the San
   Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. In each watershed, we sampled
   fire-scarred trees and tree age structure and identified fire years and
   cohorts of post-fire tree recruitment. Fire frequency varied by aspect,
   and we observed the largest differences between the north- and
   south-facing aspects in the two largest basins. Fire severity was also
   different by aspect, with low-severity fire regimes on south-facing
   slopes and mixed-severity fire on north-facing slopes. The majority of
   fire years were unique, single-basin fires, indicating a lack of
   synchrony of fire years among basins, which we attributed to fire
   barriers and rugged terrain. We conducted Superposed Epoch Analysis
   (SEA) on two groups of fire years, to show average climate conditions
   before and during fire years. The first group were unique single-basin
   fires (n = 27) and the second group included all years when synchronous
   fire burned in two or three basins (n = 15). Both groups had
   significantly dry Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) values during the
   fire year (p < 0.01), while the second group also showed significantly
   wet conditions for two years prior to the fire year (p < 0.01). Steep
   topography and fire barriers likely reduced the influence of regional
   climatic on the frequency and timing of fires for individual basins,
   though fires still burned during years of regional drought. Rugged
   terrain also contributed to asynchronous fire years among basins and
   longer fire return intervals compared with other ponderosa pine and
   mixed conifer forests in the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The 2000 Valley Complex wildfire burned in steep montane forests with
   ash cap soils in western Montana, USA. The effects of high soil burn
   severity on forest soil hydrologic function were examined using rainfall
   simulations (100 mm h(-1) for 1 h) on 0.5-m(2) plots. Infiltration
   rates, sediment yields and sediment concentrations were compared among
   three treatments: control (unburned and undisturbed); bare (unburned
   with all surface vegetation, litter, and duff removed prior to each
   simulation); and burned. Rainfall simulations were done immediately
   after the fire and repeated in 2001, 2002, and 2005. Soil moisture,
   water repellency, and understory canopy and ground cover were measured
   and related to infiltration rates and sediment yields. The unburned
   forest soil was water repellent at the mineral surface. This surface
   repellency was no longer detected after it was burned at high severity,
   but a post-fire water repellent soil layer was observed at 1-2 cm below
   the surface. The control plots had high ground cover (90\% overall),
   infiltration of 44-48 mm, and very low sediment concentrations (median
   values of 0.1-0.6 g L-1) and sediment yields (6-54 g m(-2)) for all
   years despite changes in soil moisture and strong water repellency. The
   bare and control plots had similar water repellency values, but the
   interrill erosion in the bare plots was high throughout the study
   (624-1277 g m(-2)) In the year of the fire, the burned sites had high
   rates of soil water repellency (88\%) and little ground cover (10\%).
   This resulted in low infiltration rates (30 mm), high sediment
   concentrations (median value 21 g L-1), and high sediment yields (1157 g
   m(-2)). By 2005, the fire-altered water repellency decreased in
   occurrence (48\%) and severity, and the ground cover increased (42\%).
   This resulted in much greater infiltration (84 mm), lower sediment
   concentration (median value 0.5 g L-1), and lower sediment yields (15 g
   m(-2)) on the burned plots. The importance of ground cover for
   preventing interrill erosion was demonstrated by the very low sediment
   yields on the control plots as compared to the bare and burned plots.
   The strength and occurrence of water repellency in both the unburned and
   burned sites decreased as soil moisture increased; however, strong soil
   water repellency was detected at the soil surface whenever unburned
   soils were dry. Fire-altered soil water repellency influenced the
   infiltration capacity and increased runoff rates immediately after the
   fire; however, the loss of protective ground cover was a more
   significant factor for the increased sediment concentrations and
   sediment yields. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass burning is a global phenomenon and systematic burned area
   mapping is of increasing importance for science and applications. With
   high spatial resolution and novelty in band design, the recently
   launched Sentinel-2A satellite provides a new opportunity for moderate
   spatial resolution burned area mapping. This study examines the
   performance of the Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument ( MSI) bands
   and derived spectral indices to differentiate between unburned and
   burned areas. For this purpose, five pairs of pre-fire and post-fire top
   of atmosphere ( TOA reflectance) and atmospherically corrected ( surface
   reflectance) images were studied. The pixel values of locations that
   were unburned in the first image and burned in the second image, as well
   as the values of locations that were unburned in both images which
   served as a control, were compared and the discrimination of individual
   bands and spectral indices were evaluated using parametric ( transformed
   divergence) and non-parametric ( decision tree) approaches. Based on the
   results, the most suitable MSI bands to detect burned areas are the 20 m
   near-infrared, short wave infrared and red-edge bands, while the
   performance of the spectral indices varied with location. The
   atmospheric correction only significantly influenced the separability of
   the visible wavelength bands. The results provide insights that are

   In the burn treatment, 19.3\% of residual live overstory trees were
   scarred, compared to 32.4\% of trees in the thin + burn treatment.
   Analysis of scar area revealed that thinning before burning
   significantly increased the surface area (cm(2)) of fire scars. In
   general, trees in the red oak group (Erythrobalanus spp.) had the
   greatest percentage of scarred trees, followed by the white oak group
   (Leucobalanus spp.), hickories (Carya spp.), and shortleaf pines (Pinus
   echinata Mill.). Our data indicate that two fires did not significantly
   decrease the radial growth of white oaks, except in stands which were
   thinned prior to prescribed burns. Average percent change in ring-widths
   (mm) suggest a 1.9\% growth decrease in control, 1.4\% decrease in burn,
   84\% increase in thin, and a 35\% increase in thin + burn. Covariates
   such as age, slope, surrounding basal area, canopy openness, and fire
   scars were analyzed, but tree diameter was the only significant
   predictor of growth response. Overall, results suggest that effects of
   prescribed burning are more pronounced in thinned stands as a function
   of increased fuel loads and fire intensity, causing greater mortality,
   fire scarring, and reductions in potential growth than fire or thinning
   alone. This study highlights important tradeoffs between prescribed fire
   and thinning in oak dominated ecosystems, especially where fire related
   damages are in potential conflict with other stand objectives. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Fuel reduction treatments are often designed to achieve multiple
   resource management objectives in addition to reducing potential fire
   hazard. In the White Mountains of Arizona State (U.S.A.), the 2014 San
   Juan Fire burned through several thinning prescriptions designed to

   reduced fire severity for a standard set of fuel treatments, but the
   range of variability in fuel treatment effectiveness for alternative

   High-severity fire effects were estimated to be reduced between 114 m

   alternative fuel treatment prescriptions with various target

Abstract = {{Fire is an important disturbance in forest ecosystems globally. Many of
   the effects of fire on forest processes are mediated through effects on
   vegetation structure. Understanding how fire properties, fire regimes
   and environmental variation interact to affect structure is required in
   the face of predictions of increasing size and severity of fires -
   ``megafires{''}. Here, we investigated the influence of topographic
   position, fire severity, and time since last fire on vegetation
   structure in foothill eucalypt forests, two years after a large wildfire
   in south-eastern Australia. We found that forest gullies had
   significantly greater structural complexity than forest slopes; but that
   fire severity and time since last fire influenced the structure of
   vegetation in gullies and slopes in similar ways. Two years after
   wildfire, severely burnt gullies and slopes (tree crowns scorched or
   consumed) had a reduced canopy cover, but a denser cover of eucalypt
   saplings up to 4 m tall, than gullies and slopes that had not been
   burnt. Compared with severe fire, understorey fire had much less
   influence on the structure of vegetation, with a significant effect only
   on slopes. There was little effect of the time since last fire prior to
   2009 (<= 3 years vs. >= 20 years) on subsequent vegetation structure
   after wildfire in either gullies or slopes. Finally, we found that fire
   did not homogenise the structure of gullies and slopes: vegetation
   structure in paired gullies and slopes did not become more similar
   following understorey or severe fire. Two years after a large wildfire,
   heterogeneity in the structural complexity of forest vegetation was
   evident at both the site and landscape scale. At the landscape scale,
   fire-induced heterogeneity in vegetation structure, arising from spatial
   variation in fire severity, provides habitat structures of differing
   quality for plants and animals. At a finer scale, the rapid return of
   distinct vegetation structure between adjacent gullies and slopes is
   important for the persistence of species that depend on a complex
   vegetation structure or require fine-scale heterogeneity in vegetation.

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition that natural disturbance is a dominant
   force in forest development. This paper sets out to review natural
   disturbances and their effects in forests in Australia, and to determine
   whether or not the effects of management of forests for all of their
   benefits can be contained within the known effects of natural
   disturbance.
   The history and evolutionary significance of fire in Australia is
   reviewed, and the differing fire ecologies of two representative
   species, Eucalyptus regnans in the south-east (which is killed by fire
   and regenerates prolifically from seed after fire) and Eucalyptus
   marginata in the south-west (which survives all but the most severe
   fires and regenerates from both shoots and seeds) are outlined. The
   development of E. regnans following stand-replacing fire can be defined
   as highly resilient (returning quickly to the pre-disturbance state) and
   that of E. marginata as resistant (difficult to move from the
   pre-disturbance state).
   The topic of forest management in relation to disturbance is discussed
   within the context of forests of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the
   world's tallest flowering plant, in south-eastern Australia. These
   forests in their natural state are essentially even-aged or at the most
   include two to three age-classes, the result of regeneration following
   stand-replacing bushfires. They produce timber of high value, and
   cuffent land planning and management prescriptions allow for about
   one-half of the forest area to be managed for timber production on a
   sustained-yield basis. The silvicultural system is clear-felling,
   followed by burning to give stand-replacing conditions. Mountain ash
   regenerating from this system is one of the fastest growing tree species
   in the world and at its best has a volume increment of 50 m3 ha-1 year-1
   and net primary production of 35 t ha-1 year-1 over the first 10 years.
   There is no definitive evidence of a loss of diversity of plant species
   in timber production forests. The greatest problem is to manage land for
   timber production and for the diversity of fauna which depend on nesting
   hollows in large dead or living trees. However, all of the species found
   in older forests can be found in regrowth forests which have been burned
   or logged over the past 50 years and which include large dead or living
   trees with nesting hollows.
   Them has been speculation that harvesting mountain ash forests by
   clearfelling and regenerating them following slash-burning will lead to
   a loss of nutrients and a consequent loss of productivity. Nutrient
   cycling in mountain ash is shown to be resilient to disturbance. Rapid
   uptake of nutrients by the regenerating forest, immobilization of
   nutrients by microorganisms, and increased rates of nitrogen fixation
   are processes which lead to the conservation of nutrients following
   stand-replacing fires. There is no evidence of productivity decline
   following bushfire or timber harvesting.
   Another concern about forest harvesting is that there will be a
   reduction in carbon storage. The break-even point for E. regnans
   plantations yielding short-lived products (e.g. paper) is 3 7 years and
   for E. regnans forests grown for sawn timber, 60 years. Harvesting
   forests on rotations of 80-120 years will therefore result in an
   increase in carbon storage; however, it would take several rotations to
   restore carbon storage equivalent to that of old-age forest.
   Much of the literature on disturbance illustrates the difficulties of
   dealing with traditional and sometimes deeply entrenched concepts of how
   plant communities develop and the nature of the end-state of
   development. Development of mountain ash forest fits within Egler's
   model of initial floristic composition; there is no stable and
   self-perpetuating end-point, the climax is probably no more than the
   state where species change is immeasurably slow, and maximum diversity
   and productivity are maintained by random periodic disturbance. Does
   this set of conclusions provide the basis for management of the forest?
   The management of diversity in heath is discussed as an example; the
   issue is less contentious than in forests since no commercial product is
   harvested. Coastal heath on soils of poor fertility in Victoria also
   follows the model of initial floristic composition; diversity and
   productivity are maintained by fire, decreasing markedly within 20-50
   years of disturbance. Management can use fire to maintain a mosaic of
   regenerated heathland to accommodate the range of responses of fauna and
   flora to disturbance, thereby maximizing diversity.
   The solution of maintaining diversity through an intermediate level of
   disturbance is well-established in the ecological literature; through
   disturbance, an equilibrium is never reached and higher diversity is
   maintained. In the managed forest, management dictates the disturbance
   regime (frequency, size and intensity) which must be fined to the
   attributes, or life histories, of the organisms to be managed.
   This paper presents the view that timber harvesting in Australian
   forests is ecologically sustainable and that the effects of management
   can be contained within the framework of those caused by natural
   disturbance. Given that each plot in the forest differs from all other
   plots and that none is at steady state, a solution for the management of
   diversity is to use the whole of the forest estate (parks, stream
   reserves, catchment reserves, old-age forest, forests of different ages
   resulting from past fires and logging) so that diversity of the estate,
   rather than diversity of each plot, is maximized.}},

   Seedling growth decreased with increasing temperature of the heat

   correlated with seed age. Our results suggest that fire and seed age
   could affect demographic responses of R.acetosella seedling populations.
   Post-fire recruitment could be partially favored by the positive effect

Abstract = {{In North America, Eurasia, and Australia, salvage logging is
   increasingly being used to mitigate economic losses due to fire,
   although the effects of this type of intervention are still essentially
   unknown. In a field experiment in a large recent boreal forest fire in
   central Quebec, we used 24 paired salvaged and non-salvaged stands to
   test the effect of salvage on the recruitment of two conifer species
   possessing an aerial seed bank (Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana). The
   seedbeds following salvage were, on average, more hospitable to
   germination, but, incongruously, engendered far lower regeneration
   densities. The poor recruitment on salvaged sites was due primarily to
   the loss of seeds following the immediate post-fire salvage, when
   cone-bearing branches were removed along with the trunks. By contrast,
   the density of the asexually-recruited Populus tremuloides was
   relatively unaffected. We suggest simple ways to modify current salvage
   procedures that would retard this transition from conifer to Populus
   forest, as well as leaving more wood in situ.}},

Abstract = {{It is not clear which mechanisms are responsible for changing soil
   biological activity following a fire. To address this knowledge gap, we
   measured such parameters of soil biological activity as flux rates of
   CH4, and CO2 and identified key environmental parameters that can
   influence soil biological activity. Soil samples were collected in
   burned and adjacent unburned control forests, along a 3000 km-long
   north-south transect in European Russia. A raw biological activity of
   tested soil samples varied significantly between forest types, but not
   between burned and control forest stands. Linear mixed effect modeling
   demonstrated a striking contrast in the importance of different drivers
   in sustaining a soil biological activity in the burned and control
   forests. The optimal model of basal soil respiration consisted of:
   ``Soil moisture{''} (26\%), ``Fire treatment x Soil moisture x Labile
   soil N:P ratio{''} (21\%), and ``Fire treatment x Labile soil C x Labile
   soil N:P ratio{''} (13\%). The model for CH4 in turn was defined by
   interactions of bulk and labile soil C with soil moisture and other
   factors. Our study clearly demonstrated that forest fires affect soil
   biological activity rather indirectly through modifying soil properties.
   The results enable forecasting post-fire effects on soil functioning in

   opportunistic study to examine understory plant community responses to
   pre-fire fuel reduction treatments in areas dominated by dry
   mixed-conifer forests. In 2016, five years after the fire, we remeasured
   nine pairs of treated and untreated sites that were installed in 2012
   and compared understory characteristics including species cover,
   richness and community composition. Native plant cover was significantly
   higher (20\% total cover) in areas that were treated for fuel reduction
   before the fire compared with untreated areas (17\% cover), despite the
   variability in fire severity and tree mortality. Non-native plant cover
   was not significantly different between treated and untreated units.
   Herbaceous understory cover was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with
   total tree basal area and tree canopy cover in treated as well as
   untreated units, and positively correlated with tree mortality and basal
   area mortality in the untreated units. In the treated units, species
   richness and diversity were negatively (r = -0.62 to -0.63) correlated

   experimentally the ignitability, the sustainability, the combustibility
   and the consumability of undisturbed (=non-reconstructed) litter samples
   with a point-source mode of ignition. Although the frequency of ignition
   was similar between all the vegetation types, we distinguished four

   sparse shrublands dominated by Cistus species, medium shrublands with
   cork oak, high Erica shrublands with sparse cork oak woodlands, and
   mixed mature oak woodlands with Q. suber, Q. ilex and Q. pubescens. As
   these vegetation types corresponded to a specific range of past fire
   recurrence, we also tested the effect of the number of fires and the

   recurrently burned had low ability to propagate flames and low flame
   sustainability. We discuss how the recent fire history can modify

Abstract = {{Approximately 20 experimental fires were conducted on forest plots of
   1-4 ha each in 2000-07 in two types of boreal forests in central
   Siberia, and 18 on 6 x 12-m plots in 2008-10. These experiments were
   designed to mimic wildfires under similar burning conditions. The fires
   were conducted in prescribed conditions including full documentation on
   pre-fire weather, pre-fire and post-fire forest fuels, fire intensities,
   and other biological, physical and chemical parameters. The amount of
   particulate matter emitted during a typical fire averaged 0.6 t ha(-1)
   and ranged within 0.2-1.0 t ha(-1) depending on burning conditions.
   Particulates accounted for similar to 1-7\% of the total mass of the
   consumed biomass during a typical forest fire (10-30 t ha(-1) based on
   our data from 2000-07). Most of the particulate matter consists of
   organic substances, 77\% on average, with a range of 70-90\%. Elemental
   carbon averaged 8\%, with a range of 2-18\%. Trace element compositions
   and amounts of particulates indicate that there was no actual difference
   in the element emissions sampled from the fires conducted in the two
   forest types (6-8\% in larch forest and 8\% in pine forest). Most of the
   particulate matter, 90-95\%, consists of submicrometre and
   near-micrometre particles similar to 0.1-5 mu m in diameter.}},

   associated with knowledge of forest succession for mixed forest types

   uncertainty in expert knowledge is highest when vegetation dynamics are
   highly stochastic as with complex species assemblages, environmental
   controls on succession are weak, and effects of disturbances are less
   drastic. Awareness about the degree of uncertainty in expert knowledge

Abstract = {{To reduce soil erosion after fires, forest managers commonly employ
   rehabilitation treatments, including application of grass seed or
   mulching with straw. In 1999 the Megram fire burned 24,000 ha of mixed
   conifer/tanoak forest in northern California, USA. In the subsequent
   year, some areas were aerially seeded with barley and others were
   mulched with rice straw; some areas received both treatments. We
   investigated how these treatments affected these aspects of ecological
   recovery: (a) the introduction of non-native plants, (b) percent
   vegetative cover, (c) the diversity and density of regenerating native
   plants, and (d) the density and frequency of conifer seedlings. We found
   that mulched quadrats had a significantly higher occurrence of
   non-native species than untreated quadrats did. In addition, we found
   little evidence that mulching or mulching + seeding facilitated recovery
   of the native plant community. Percent vegetative cover was no higher in
   treated quadrats than in untreated quadrats. While annuals were present
   in significantly higher densities in the mulched + seeded quadrats
   compared to the other treatments, perennial density and overall plant
   density were not affected by treatment. Mulching and mulching + seeding
   significantly reduced the density and frequency of conifer seedlings.
   While we found similar native species richness on a perquadrat basis for
   all three treatments, the cumulative number of native species in
   untreated quadrats taken as a whole exceeded the numbers found in
   mulched-only and mulched + seeded quadrats. We recommend that managers
   take steps to assure that mulch is free of non-native seed, and that
   further efforts be made to investigate systematically aspects of
   ecological recovery after the application of rehabilitation treatments.

   forms, species traits with respect to the kind of fuel (i.e. woody and

   recurrent fires because a second fire in the period of maximum fire risk
   created a community with less dead fuel. This result implies a lack of

Abstract = {{In close-to-nature silviculture one strives to derive the advantages of
   the natural adaptations of tree species to different growth conditions.
   Evidence of the natural distribution of tree species is obtained through
   vegetation science ( recent ground vegetation, primeval forest relicts),
   studies of old written sources, and pollen and macrofossil analyses.
   Here we have analysed macrofossil samples of charcoal kiln sites and the
   recent ecological conditions in the vicinity of these sites, as well as
   secondary written sources on forest and land-use history. From charcoal
   analysis of kiln sites we were looking for spatial patterns of past tree
   species exploitation, with special regard to regional and local
   differences in the forest growth conditions and the natural wood supply.
   Therefore, we selected remote forest areas characterised by a high
   density of kiln sites and significant differences in the ecological
   conditions. The sample sites ranged over a landscape pro. le of 40 km,
   covering many ecological site types. The anthracological results of 181
   post-medieval kiln sites were evaluated, considering two spatial scales:
   the total 40- km pro. le and a fine-scale pro. le of 4 km. Considering
   the charcoal material analysed as a whole, all of the tree taxa to be
   expected based on the natural conditions were found. The frequencies of
   the exploited taxa also reflected a natural situation. Wood of the
   climax vegetation, Fagus, Abies and Picea, was mainly used and all other
   taxa were quantitatively unimportant. The results for the individual
   sites showed considerable differences in taxa composition, from which
   regular spatial patterns of the past tree species distribution were
   deduced. These regional and local patterns are explained by natural
   differences in the ecological conditions in the vicinity of the sample
   sites. At the same time, new indications of the natural tree species
   composition of our forests are inferred. A pronounced dependency of
   charcoal production on the local natural wood supply is discernible. No
   indications of tree species selection or forest degradation could be
   found.}},

Abstract = {{Explaining the variation in communities of soil organisms across plant
   communities or ecosystems remains a major challenge for ecologists.
   Several studies have explored how soil communities are affected along
   ecosystem successional gradients but most of these are based on
   relatively short term chronosequences. To address the impact of
   ecosystem age on micro-arthropod communities, we utilized a 5000 year
   old post-fire chronosequence, which consists of thirty lake islands
   differing greatly in time since fire in the boreal forested zone of
   northern Sweden. The Acari community did not change along this
   chronosequence, indicating that Acari rapidly(<60 yr) reach equilibrium
   after forest fire and that they are relatively unresponsive to
   subsequent long term changes in plant community composition and soil
   quality. The Collembola community composition, however, showed greater
   responsiveness to the chronosequence and this was best explained through
   their functional traits. Notably, the youngest (most recently burned)
   islands, which had the highest ecosystem productivity and fungal mass
   turnover, were dominated by soil-dwelling (eu-edaphic) Collembola
   species that are best positioned to take advantage of resource input to
   the soil. Although plant community characteristics did not emerge as
   powerful drivers of the Collembola community, we found that Collembola
   community composition was related to the quality (N and P) of the soil
   substrate, which reflects a long term legacy of the plant community.
   Collembola life history characteristics proved to be important for
   understanding how abundances of different taxa varied relative to one
   another across the gradients of plant diversity and substrate quality
   gradients that occur across long-term chronosequences. The causal
   connection between vertical stratification of Collembola and substrate
   quality is at present unclear but is likely to be related to their
   feeding preferences and microhabitat conditions. Because the
   soil-dwelling Collembola showed a strong decline in abundance with
   ecosystem retrogression while surface-dwelling Collembola did not these
   two life history groups may operate as functionally distinct groups
   within the soil food web across these long-term chronosequences. 2017

Abstract = {{Alteration of Iowa, USA, landscapes for agricultural production has
   resulted in a loss of >99\% of the original prairie and >95\% of native
   wetlands. This conversion has included riparian areas, which, as
   interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, are important to
   many wildlife species. Farm Bill programs have resulted in the
   reestablishment of millions of hectares of grasslands and wetlands
   nationwide, including >100,000 ha in riparian areas of the Midwest. We
   assessed plant and arthropod responses to burning and disking of
   riparian grasslands in east-central Iowa in 2001 and 2002. Burning
   altered the plant community by removing litter and standing dead
   vegetation and had negative effects on several arthropod taxa, including
   Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. However, we observed no differences in
   vegetation or arthropods between burned and unburned fields during the
   second year postburning (P > 0.05). Disking decreased the cover of
   grasses, litter, and standing dead vegetation and increased plant
   species richness and the cover of forbs and bare ground (P < 0.05).
   Arthropod abundance and dry biomass were greater on disked than undisked
   portions of fields (P < 0.05). Increases in the abundance and biomass of
   arthropods associated with changes in vegetation structure and
   composition likely improved habitat quality for a number of breeding
   bird species. Both burning and disking appear to be effective management
   options for maintaining or enhancing riparian grasslands for wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems in the eastern United States that were shaped by fire over
   thousands of years of anthropogenic burning recently have been subjected
   to fire suppression resulting in significant changes in vegetation
   composition and structure and encroachment by invasive species. Renewed
   interest in use of fire to manage such ecosystems will require knowledge
   of effects of fire regime on vegetation. We studied the effects of one
   aspect of the fire regime, fire frequency, on biomass, cover and
   diversity of understory vegetation in upland oak forests
   prescribe-burned for 20 years at different frequencies ranging from zero
   to five fires per decade. Overstory canopy closure ranged from 88 to
   96\% and was not affected by fire frequency indicating high tolerance of
   large trees for even the most frequent burning. Understory species
   richness and cover was dominated by woody reproduction followed in
   descending order by forbs, C3 graminoids, C4 grasses, and legumes. Woody
   plant understory cover did not change with fire frequency and increased
   30\% from one to three years after a burn. Both forbs and C3 graminoids
   showed a linear increase in species richness and cover as fire frequency
   increased. In contrast, C4 grasses and legumes did not show a response
   to fire frequency. The reduction of litter by fire may have encouraged
   regeneration of herbaceous plants and helped explain the positive
   response of forbs and C3 graminoids to increasing fire frequency. Our
   results showed that herbaceous biomass, cover, and diversity can be
   managed with long-term prescribed fire under the closed canopy of upland

   mycorrhizal symbiosis in Eucalyptus forests. Fire is frequent and a
   dominant ecological factor in these forests, and this study tested the
   hypothesis that fire triggers both increased sporocarp production by
   some hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with eucalypts, and
   increased mycophagy by mammals. Three experimental burns were set in E.
   tenui-ramus forest in southeastern Tasmania. Digging activity (which
   reflects feeding on hypogeous fungi) by a mycophagous marsupial, the
   Tasmanian bettong Bettongia gaimardi, increased up to ten-fold after
   fire, with a peak about 1 month post-fire. This was associated with a
   similar pattern of increase in sporocarp production, which was due to
   species in the family Mesophelliaceae (especially Castoreum tasmanicum
   acid Mesophellia spp.). This family appears to have radiated in
   association with eucalypts and has an exclusively Australasian
   distribution, unlike many of the other ectomycorrhizal fungi collected
   in this study which are cosmopolitan and have broad host ranges. No B.
   gaimardi were killed by fire, and there was no increase in mortality
   following fire. Population density increased after fire as a result of
   immigration of adult males. However, body condition and fecundity of
   individual B. gaimardi were maintained at pre-fire levels. This suggests
   that the availability of energy to B. gaimardi increased as a result of
   fire, and the fact that the contribution of fungus to the diet of B.
   gaimardi was high on burnt relative to control sites suggests further
   that this increase in energy availability was provided by hypogeous
   fungi. Effects of fire on hypogeous fungi and B. gaimardi were
   short-lived; all measured variables returned to control values about 4
   months after fire. The capacity of B. gaimardi to survive fire and to
   harvest the increased sporocarp production triggered by fire provides a
   mechanism for the rapid dispersal of spores after fire. This should
   result in the establishment of ectomycorrhizae very early in post-fire
   succession. Because only some species of ectomycorrhizal fungi fruited
   in response to burning, fire probably has a strong influence on
   community structure among ectomycorrhizal fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial communities influence the rate and trajectory of

   severely burned ({''}high burn{''}) in ponderosa pine ('P') and mixed

   differences in initial and post-burn M and P soil parameters (i.e. pH,

   to correlate with shifts in bacterial community composition. Richness
   tended to be lower in the high burn M soils relative to unburned M
   soils, while it was similar across all P soils. Collectively, our

   a large wildfire that took place in October 2017. Groundwater samples
   were collected in four springs that emerged within burned forests, while
   control samples were from one spring located in an unburned area.
   Sampling took place from October 2017 until September 2018, starting 15
   days after the wildfire occurrence, to evaluate the influence of the

   composition. Groundwater samples collected in burned areas presented
   increased content of sulfate, fluoride and nitrogen and variability in
   pH values. Iron, manganese and chromium contents also increased during

Abstract = {{Dense, monospecific cattail (Typha spp.) stands are a problem in many

   Wildlife Area, a Wetland of International Importance in central Kansas,
   has experienced a large increase in cattails and a subsequent decrease
   in migratory wetland bird use. As a consequence, intensive cattail
   management is practiced. We assessed the effectiveness of prescribed
   burning, discing following prescribed burning, and cattle grazing
   following prescribed burning at two stocking rates of 5 and 20 head per
   11 ha in suppressing cattail, as well as the effects of these treatments
   on non-cattail vegetation. The disced and high-intensity (20 head per 11
   ha) grazed treatments resulted in the lowest cattail densities and
   biomass. Implementation of these treatments, however, was at the expense
   of the non-cattail aquatic plant community. Species richness and
   diversity, and non-cattail shoot density and biomass, were generally
   lowest in these treatments. In managed wetlands where cattail reduction
   is the objective, we recommend discing or high-intensity grazing
   following prescribed burning to improve wildlife use, at least in the
   short-term, as they suppressed cattail more effectively than burning

Abstract = {{Fire is an important ecological disturbance in vegetated ecosystems
   across the globe, and also has considerable impacts on human
   infrastructure. Vegetation flammability is a key bottom-up control on
   fire regimes and on the nature of individual fires. Although New Zealand
   (NZ) historically had low fire frequencies, anthropogenic fires have
   considerably impacted indigenous vegetation as humans used fire
   extensively to clear forests. Few studies of vegetation flammability
   have been undertaken in NZ and only one has compared the flammability of
   indigenous plants; this was a qualitative assessment derived from expert
   opinion. We addressed this knowledge gap by measuring the flammability
   of terminal shoots from a range of trees and shrubs found in NZ. We
   quantified shoot flammability of 60 indigenous and exotic species, and
   compared our experimentally derived ranking with expert opinion. The
   most flammable species was the invasive exotic shrub Gorse (Ulex
   europaeus), followed by Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), K (u) over bar
   marahou (Pomaderris kumeraho), Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) and Silver
   Beech (Lophozonia menziesii). Our experimentally derived ranking was
   strongly correlated with expert opinion, lending support to both

   identifying high-risk landscapes, and low flammability species for green

   from 7.7 to 53.9 Mg ha(-1). Heli-mulching reduced soil loss by on
   average 90\%. The variation in mulch cover in the first and second years
   after fire was significantly related to mean gust wind velocity. Soil
   burn severity and the mean dry mean weight diameter of soil aggregates
   were related to soil loss and modulated the effects of mulching during

Abstract = {{The spread of buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) in semi-arid Australia in
   recent decades has substantially increased ground cover and fuel loads,
   particularly in open woodland vegetation communities. The resulting
   alteration of fire regimes may be the most significant impact of buffel
   invasion on ecological communities in these areas. Broad scale
   management of buffel grass is currently not an option in Australia but
   it is becoming increasingly relevant to assess the benefits of restoring
   areas of native vegetation where preventing buffel grass invasion is
   no-longer possible. We managed buffel grass in a series of experimental
   plots from 2008-2012. In June and August 2011, two unplanned fires burnt
   through the plots providing a unique opportunity to compare the outcome
   of wildfire, including the spatial pattern of fire, and the effect on
   ground vegetation and on a long-lived, perennial overstorey species, in
   replicated managed and unmanaged plots. The area of ground that remained
   unburnt was much greater in managed plots (with predominantly native
   vegetation) than unmanaged (predominantly buffel grass) plots and where
   the managed plots did burn the fire was more patchy. This had direct
   implications for the richness of ground layer plant taxa following fire
   and the extent to which overstorey trees were exposed to fire. Fire
   increased pre-existing differences in the number of taxa in the ground
   level vegetation, an effect that persisted for the duration of our
   study, suggesting that fire accelerates direct negative competitive
   effects between buffel grass and native grasses and forbs. Hakea
   divaricata (fork-leafed corkwood) trees in unmanaged buffel grass sites
   suffered higher burn intensities, and their long-term viability at this
   location is likely to be threatened if fires fuelled by buffel grass
   continue. Our results demonstrate clear benefits of removing
   fire-enhancing invasive plants from areas of high conservation value.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have claimed that fire acts as the chief ecological factor

   meaningful dormancy-breaking cues because: (1) fire is erratic and may
   break PY in seasons during which seedlings cannot complete their life
   cycle; (2) fire may not occur for long periods, thereby only providing
   an opportunity for dormancy break and germination once in every several
   years; and (3) if fire opens the specialized anatomical structures
   called `water gaps', in seconds, their evolutionary role of detecting
   environmental conditions becomes irrational. Although fire breaks
   dormancy in a proportion of seeds, given the risk of seed mortality and
   the post-fire environment providing cues for dormancy break, it is
   suggested that fire might possibly be an exaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major ecological process in ecosystems globally. Its impacts
   on fauna can be both direct (e.g., mortality) and indirect (e.g.,
   altered habitat), resulting in population recovery being driven by
   several possible mechanisms. Separating direct from indirect impacts of
   fire on faunal population recovery can be valuable in guiding management
   of biodiversity in fire-prone environments. However, resolving the
   influence of direct and indirect processes remains a key challenge
   because many processes affecting fauna can change concomitantly with
   time since fire. We explore the mechanisms influencing bird response to
   fire by posing the question, can temporal changes in vegetation
   structure predict changes in bird occurrence on sites, and can these be
   separated from other temporal changes using the surrogate of time since
   fire? We conducted a 12-yr study of bird and vegetation responses to
   fire at 124 sites across six vegetation classes in Booderee National
   Park, Australia. Approximately half of these sites, established in 2002,
   were burned by a large (>3000 ha) wildfire in 2003. To disentangle
   collinear effects of temporal changes in vegetation and direct
   demographic effects on population recovery that are subsumed by time
   since fire, we incorporated both longitudinal and cross-sectional
   vegetation effects in addition to time since fire within logistic
   structural equation models. We identified temporal changes in vegetation
   structure and richness of plant and bird species that characterized
   burned and unburned sites in all vegetation classes. For nine bird
   species, a significant component of the year trend was driven by
   temporal trends in one of three vegetation variables (number of
   understory or midstory plant species, or midstory cover). By contrast,
   we could not separate temporal effects between time since fire and
   vegetation attributes for bird species richness, reporting rate, and the
   occurrence of 11 other bird species. Our findings help identify species
   for which indirect effects of vegetation dominate recovery and thus may
   benefit from vegetation management where conservation actions are
   required and, conversely, those species for which direct effects of time
   since fire drive recovery, where simply leaving a system to recover
   following the last disturbance will be sufficient.}},

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{In most habitats, vegetation provides the main structure of the
   environment. This complexity can facilitate biodiversity and ecosystem
   services. Therefore, measures of vegetation structure can serve as
   indicators in ecosystem management. However, many structural measures
   are laborious and require expert knowledge. Here, we used consistent and
   convenient measures to assess vegetation structure over an exceptionally
   broad elevation gradient of 866-4550m above sea level at Mount
   Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Additionally, we compared (human)-modified
   habitats, including maize fields, traditionally managed home gardens,
   grasslands, commercial coffee farms and logged and burned forests with
   natural habitats along this elevation gradient. We distinguished
   vertical and horizontal vegetation structure to account for habitat
   complexity and heterogeneity. Vertical vegetation structure (assessed as
   number, width and density of vegetation layers, maximum canopy height,
   leaf area index and vegetation cover) displayed a unimodal elevation
   pattern, peaking at intermediate elevations in montane forests, whereas
   horizontal structure (assessed as coefficient of variation of number,
   width and density of vegetation layers, maximum canopy height, leaf area
   index and vegetation cover) was lowest at intermediate altitudes.
   Overall, vertical structure was consistently lower in modified than in
   natural habitat types, whereas horizontal structure was inconsistently
   different in modified than in natural habitat types, depending on the
   specific structural measure and habitat type. Our study shows how
   vertical and horizontal vegetation structure can be assessed efficiently
   in various habitat types in tropical mountain regions, and we suggest to
   apply this as a tool for informing future biodiversity and ecosystem
   service studies.}},

   woodlands following drought-induced mortality}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{341}},

Abstract = {{Two decades of drought and rising temperatures have triggered bark
   beetle outbreaks and extensive mortality of Colorado pinon (Pinus
   edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) across the southwest
   US. For example from 2002 to 2005, over one-third of the pinons in Mesa
   Verde National Park's old-growth woodlands were killed by the bark
   beetle Ips confusus and other drought-related factors. Extensive
   wild-fires have also burned through the Park over the last two decades,
   reducing the extent of old-growth woodlands by nearly one-half. We
   compared historical (1970-19905) and recent (2005-2011) data to gauge
   the effects of the 2002-2005 mortality event on canopy structure, woody
   surface fuels, and tree recruitment. Large, mature pinons were the most
   susceptible to mortality; we measured significant reductions in pinon
   cover and diameter. Due to the loss of large trees, woodlands that were
   subjected to substantial mortality had reduced structural complexity
   relative to nearby unaffected stands. In a longitudinal fuels
   comparison, 2010-2011 fuels were compared to historical 1993 values in
   the same plots; we could not detect a change in woody fuel load. However
   when the 2010-2011 fuels are compared across mortality severity classes,
   there was a trend toward slightly greater 1-100 h, greater 1000 h fuel
   loads, and more litter in stands with higher levels of tree mortality.
   However, modeled surface fire behavior did not differ across mortality
   severity classes. Modeled crown fires needed higher wind speeds to
   spread from tree to tree in stands without tree mortality, but this is
   likely due to the inherently more open canopy structure in stands that
   resisted mortality rather than due to tree mortality per se.
   Post-mortality pinon reproduction and recruitment were recorded from
   2005 to 2011 and compared with NPS monitoring data from 1975 to 1995.
   Cone production in 2005 was comparable to historical trends, but recent
   seedling and sapling densities were significantly below historical
   values. Yearly seedling and sapling density in 1975-2011 was positively
   correlated with precipitation during the sampling year and two years
   prior. The largest proportion of seedlings and saplings occurred under
   pinon or juniper canopies, and a smaller proportion under native shrubs.
   Given the loss of a substantial component of the adult trees, reduced
   stand structural complexity, and demonstrated need for moist conditions
   and nurse plants for effective recruitment, these old-growth woodlands
   may be vulnerable to decline under future warm and dry climate
   projections. Management strategies focusing on maintaining structural
   features of both the overstory and understory could help provide
   conditions for sustainable recruitment and contribute to the goal of
   conservation of rare old-growth pinon-juniper woodlands. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Small-mammal recolonization of a fire-exclusion catchment in the Natal
   Drakensberg Park was investigated by live-trapping at six-monthly
   intervals for four years after unscheduled burning. During the first two
   years the pattern of recolonization was similar to that found in
   biennially burnt grassland during previous studies in the Drakensberg;
   although numbers were initially lower. Low numbers during the first year
   may have been due to the extent of the burn (all surrounding grassland
   was also burnt), with limited nuclei from which recolonization could
   take place. During the second year, both the extent of the burn and low
   spring and early summer rainfall are believed to have affected the rate
   of population increase of small mammals. At the end of the third year,
   after average rainfall, total numbers reached a peak, slightly higher
   than numbers recorded in the catchment before it was burnt, and much
   higher than those recorded in pure grassland, where numbers generally
   start to decline markedly three or four years after burning. In the
   fire-exclusion area the vegetation contained a high woody plant
   component, which developed in the absence of fire, with an understorey
   of grass and forbs. Recovery of this vegetation had taken place by three
   years, and it is hypothesized that small-mammal recolonization did not
   follow the pattern previously recorded at three to four years post fire
   in grassland, but advanced beyond the decline and consequent low
   observed in pure grassland to the situation that exists in long-term
   fire-exclusion areas where woody vegetation has developed.}},

Title = {{Fire and restoration of sagebrush ecosystems}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{177-185}},
Abstract = {{Wildlife managers often resort to prescribed fire to restore sagebrush
   (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems thought to have been affected by fire
   exclusion. However, a fire mosaic of burned and unburned areas may be
   tolerated by certain wildlife but can be detrimental to sagebrush
   obligates. This article assesses evidence about the historical frequency
   and pattern of fire in sagebrush ecosystems and the need forprescribed
   fire. Fire-scar data from nearby forests require adjustment to estimate
   fire rotation, the time required to burn once through a sagebrush
   landscape. Estimates from forests require correction for unburned area
   and because sagebrush burns less often than forests. Recovery time also
   might indicate fire rotation. Mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia
   tridentata ssp. vaseyana) recovers within about 35-100 or more years
   after fire, and Wyoming big sagebrush (A.t. ssp. wyomingensis) requires
   50-120 or more years. Fire rotation in other ecosystems is 2 or more
   times the recovery period. Together, the evidence suggests fire
   rotations may be a minimum of 325-450 years in low sagebrush (A.
   arbuscula), 100-240 years in Wyoming big sagebrush, 70-200 years or more
   in mountain big sagebrush, and 35-100 years in mountain grasslands with
   a little sagebrush. Given these long rotations, fire exclusion likely
   has had little effect in most sagebrush areas. If maintaining and
   restoring habitat for sagebrush-dependent species is the goal, fire
   should be suppressed where there is a threat of cheatgrass (Bromus
   tectorum). Elsewhere, fire does not need to be reintroduced until native
   understory plants can be restored, so that sagebrush ecosystems can
   fully recover from fire.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of down-core variations in pollen and charcoal in two short
   cores of lake sediment and wood samples taken from the in situ remains
   of Nuxia congesta from Lake Emakat, a hydrologically-closed volcanic
   crater lake occupying the Empakaai Crater in northern Tanzania, have
   generated evidence of past vegetation change and lake level
   fluctuations. Eight AMS radiocarbon (C-14) dates on bulk samples of lake
   sediment provide a chronological framework for the two cores and
   indicate that the sediment record analysed incorporates the last c. 1200
   years. The in situ remains of a Nuxia congesta tree, now standing in
   deep water, were dated with three additional AMS C-14 dates, suggesting
   tree growth within the interval similar to 1500-1670 AD. Down-core
   variations in pollen from terrestrial taxa, particularly the montane
   forest trees Hagenia abyssinica and Nuxia congesta, indicate a broad
   period of generally more arid conditions in the catchment to c. 1200 AD
   and at a prolonged period between c. 1420 and 1680 AD. Variations in
   pollen from plants in lake margin vegetation indicate low lake levels,
   presumably as a result of reduced effective precipitation, contemporary
   with indications of relatively dry conditions mentioned above, but also
   during the late 18th and the late 19th centuries. The presence of
   charcoal throughout both cores indicates the frequent occurrence of

Abstract = {{An experimental study based on the effects of fire on soil hydrology was
   developed at the Experimental Station of `La Concordia' (Valencia,
   Spain). It is located on a calcareous hillside facing SSE and composed
   of nine erosion plots (4 x 20 m). In summer 2003, after eight years of
   soil and vegetation recovery from previous fires in 1995 (with three
   fire treatments: T1 high-intensity fire, T2 moderate intensity, and T3
   not burnt), experimental fires of low intensity were again conducted on
   the plots already burnt, to study the effects of repeated fires on the
   soil water infiltration, soil water content and runoff.
   Infiltration rates and capacities were measured by the mini-disk
   infiltrometer method (MDI), assessing the effects of vegetation cover by
   comparing the under-canopy microenvironment (UC) and its absence on bare
   soil (BS), immediately before and after the fire experiments. Soil
   properties like water retention capacity (SWRC) and water content (SWC)
   were also determined for the different fire treatments (T1, T2 and T3)
   and microsites (UC and BS). Hydrological parameters, such as runoff and
   infiltration rate, were monitored at plot scale from July 2002 to July
   2004. In the post-fire period, data displayed a 20\% runoff increase and
   a decrease in infiltration (18\%).
   Differences in the steady-state infiltration rate (SSI) and infiltration
   capacity (IC) were tested with the MDI on the different treatments (T1,
   T2 and T3), and between the UC and BS microsites of each treatment.
   After fire, the SSI of the UC soil declined from 16 mm h(-1) to 12 mm
   h(-1) on T1, and from 24 mm h(-1) to 19 mm h(-1) on T2. The IC was
   reduced by 2/3 in the T1 UC soil, and by half on T2 UC soil. On the BS
   of T1 and T2, the fire effect was minimal, and higher infiltration rates
   and capacities were reached. Therefore, the presence/absence of
   vegetation when burnt influenced the post-burnt infiltration patterns at
   soil microscale. On the T3, different rates and capacities were obtained
   depending on the microsites (UC and BS), with higher SSI (25 mm h(-1))
   and IC (226 mm h(-1)) on BS than on UC (SSI of 18 mm h(-1) and IC of 136
   mm h(-1)).
   The SWRC and SWC were recovered from 1995 to 2003 (prior to the fires).
   The 2003 fire promoted high variability on the SWC at pF 0.1, 2 and 2.5,
   and the SWRC on burnt soils were reduced. To summarize, the IC and SSI
   post-fire decreases were related to the lower infiltration rate at plot
   scale, the significant differences in the SWRC between burnt and control
   treatments, and the increase in the runoff yield (20\%).
   According to the results, the MDI was a useful tool to characterize the
   soil infiltration on the vegetation patches of the Mediterranean maquia,
   and contrary to other studies, on the UC soil, the infiltration rate and
   IC, when soil was dry, were lower than that obtained on BS. Once the
   soil gets wet, similar values were found on both microenvironments.

Abstract = {{Ecosystem disturbances that remove vegetation and disturb surface soils
   are major causes of excessive soil erosion and can result in accelerated
   transport of soils contaminated with hazardous materials. Accelerated
   wind erosion in disturbed lands that are contaminated is of particular
   concern because of potential increased inhalation exposure, yet
   measurements regarding these relationships are lacking. The importance
   of this was highlighted when, in May of 2000, the Cerro Grande fire
   burned over roughly 30\% of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),
   mostly in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest, and through areas
   with soils containing contaminants, particularly excess depleted and
   natural uranium. Additionally, post-fire thinning was performed in
   burned and unburned forests on about 25\% of LANL land. The first goal
   of this study was to assess the potential for increased inhalation dose
   from uranium contaminated soils via wind-driven resuspension of soil
   following the Cerro Grande Fire and subsequent forest thinning. This was
   done through analysis of post-disturbance measurements of uranium air
   concentrations and their relationships with wind velocity and seasonal
   vegetation cover. We found a 14\% average increase in uranium air
   concentrations at LANL perimeter locations after the fire, and the
   greatest air concentrations occurred during the months of April-June
   when wind velocities are highest, no snow cover, and low vegetation
   cover. The second goal was to develop a methodology to assess the
   relative contribution of each disturbance type towards increasing public
   and worker exposure to these resuspended soils. Measurements of
   wind-driven dust flux in severely burned, moderately burned, thinned,
   and unburned/unthinned forest areas were used to assess horizontal dust
   flux (HDF) in these areas. Using empirically derived relationships
   between measurements of HDF and respirible dust, coupled with onsite
   uranium soil concentrations, we estimate relative increases in
   inhalation doses for workers ranging from 15\% to 38\%. Despite the
   potential for increased doses resulting from these forest disturbances,
   the estimated annual dose rate for the public was < 1 mu Sv yr(-1),
   which is far below the dose limits for public exposures, and the
   upper-bound dose rate for a LANL worker was estimated to be 140 mu Sv
   yr(-1), far below the 5 x 10(4) mu Sv yr(-1) occupational dose limit.
   These results show the importance of ecosystem disturbance in increasing
   mobility of soil-bound contaminants, which can ultimately increase
   exposure. However, it is important to investigate the magnitude of the
   increases when deciding appropriate strategies for management and
   long-term stewardship of contaminated lands. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   forests, and altered fire regimes threaten the large, full-crowned
   mature trees that produce crops of high-quality acorns and provide
   cavities for many wildlife species. To examine the effects of different
   kinds of burns on tribal values including associated plants, fungi, and
   wildlife of special cultural significance, we reviewed and synthesized
   scientific studies of black oak in conjunction with interviews and
   workshops with tribal members who use the species and recall burning by
   their ancestors. We conducted two exploratory analyses to understand
   trends in large black oaks and potential tradeoffs regarding black oak
   restoration. Our findings identify opportunities for reintroducing
   low-intensity fire, in conjunction with thinning, to restore stands that
   are favorable for acorn gathering. We present examples of such projects
   and discuss how to overcome challenges in restoring the socioecological
   benefits of black oak ecosystems for tribes.}},

Abstract = {{Although development of pinyon-juniper woodlands is understood to
   require decades after stand-replacing fire, data describing
   relationships between many key structural elements and time since fire
   (TSF) are lacking. In this study, we sampled live trees, seedlings,
   shrubs, snags, and downed logs on 13 sites that together comprised a
   370-year fire chronosequence. We analyzed individual relationships
   between structural attributes and TSF. We also developed an additive
   index of structural complexity and analyzed its relationship with TSF.
   Live juniper and total tree density were positively and linearly related
   to TSF (R-2 = 0.76 and 0.49, respectively). Pinyon tree density and TSF
   were not significantly related. No live trees (>= 1.37 m height) were
   found on sites burned less than 30 years before sampling, although
   seedlings were found as early as 6 years TSF. Live pinyon tree biomass,
   live juniper biomass, and total tree biomass followed ``s-shaped{''}
   functions (4-parameter Weibull; R-2 = 0.32, 0.62, and 0.96,
   respectively), with total biomass maximizing at 65 Mg ha(-1) around 250
   years since fire. Seedling densities and shrub cover were not
   significantly related to TSF. juniper snag density showed a significant
   negative relationship with TSF (R-2 = 0.54) and total snag density
   followed a ``u-shaped{''} function depending on TSF (2nd-order
   polynomial; R-2 = 0.47). Pinyon snag density and TSF were not
   significantly related. Density of rotten logs was positively and
   linearly related to TSF (R-2 = 0.46) whereas sound logs and TSF were not
   statistically related. Structural complexity showed a positive linear
   relationship with TSF (R-2 = 0.46). These results indicate that although
   individual structural elements show various relationships with TSF,
   structural complexity increases as sites approach persistent woodland
   conditions. Findings from this study provide resource professionals with
   information that can help in developing and assessing management
   approaches intended to emulate natural structural patterns. (C) 2012

Title = {{Fire Affects Asymbiotic Nitrogen Fixation in Southern Amazon Forests}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the biogeochemical consequences of fire in
   seasonally flooded Amazon forests, where recent declines in forest cover
   have been linked to increases in fire frequency and severity. Previous
   studies have hypothesized that a quasi-permanent state-shift transition
   from typical Amazon forests to open savannas can occur when fire results
   in further depletion of already impoverished soil nutrient pools.
   Asymbiotic N-2 fixation (ANF) is an essential pathway for fire-affected
   forests to acquire nitrogen (N) after disturbance, but ANF response to
   fire has yet to be quantified in Amazonia. Here, we quantify ANF through
   field sampling and laboratory incubations using N-15-labeled dinitrogen
   (N-15(2)) and measurement of 14 biogeochemical parameters in surface
   (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-30 cm) soils. Our data represent burned and
   unburned replicated sampling sites, across five stands, spanning a
   gradient from infrequent (once in 13 years) to frequent (five times in
   13 years) fire occurrences. ANF did not vary with fire frequency but
   was, on average, 24\% lower in burned than in unburned surface soils
   across all stands. Burned and unburned subsurface soils had similar ANF
   rates. About 58\% of ANF variance was explained by the joint effect of
   carbon (C):N ratio and available phosphorus (P) in burned and unburned
   soils. ANF increased linearly with C:N and P availability in unburned
   soils, but a highly non-linear relationship was observed in burned
   soils. Our findings show that fire alters soil C-to-nutrient
   stoichiometry, which resulted in lower N inputs via ANF into burned
   relative to unburned tropical forest soils.
   Plain Language Summary The impact of fire on biological N-2 fixation in
   tropical forests is poorly understood. In Amazon forests, most of the N
   is recycled through the litter layer, which is mostly consumed during a
   fire event. Therefore, asymbiotic biological N-2 fixation (ANF) in the
   soil-the conversion of atmospheric N-2 into plant-available N by
   free-living soil bacteria or archaea-is expected to be a significant
   source of N for vegetation growth after fire events. We measured rates
   of soil ANF as well as soil C and P, which are known to affect N cycling
   in tropical forests. Rates of ANF were 24\% lower in burned compared to
   unburned surface soils (0-10 cm), while no difference was detected in
   subsurface soils (10-30 cm). At both soil depths, ANF was expected to
   increase linearly with C:N ratio and P availability, but non-linear
   relationships between soil variables make predictions more challenging
   in burned soils regardless of fire frequency. Our findings suggest that
   decreased N inputs due to post-fire ANF suppression could help
   accelerate the transition from Amazon forests to open savannas.
   Key Points
   Asymbiotic N-2 fixation (ANF) was quantified for the first time in
   fire-affected seasonally flooded Amazon forests ANF rates were, on
   average, 24\% lower in burned compared to unburned surface soils (0-10
   cm) Soil carbon:nitrogen ratio and available phosphorus explained 58\%
   of ANF variance in burned and unburned soils}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{599-612}},

Abstract = {{Redistribution of soil, nutrients, and contaminants is often driven by
   wind erosion in semiarid shrublands. Wind erosion depends on wind
   velocity (particularly during episodic, high-velocity winds) and on
   vegetation, which is generally sparse and spatially heterogeneous in
   semiarid ecosystems. Further, the vegetation cover can be rapidly and
   greatly altered due to disturbances, particularly fire. Few studies,
   however, have evaluated key temporal and spatial components of wind
   erosion with respect to (i) erosion rates on the scale of weeks as a
   function of episodic high-velocity winds, (ii) rates at unburned and
   burned sites, and (iii) within-site spatial heterogeneity in erosion.
   Measuring wind erosion in unburned and recently burned Chihuahuan desert
   shrubland, we found (i) weekly wind erosion was related more to daily
   peak wind velocities than to daily average velocities as consistent with
   our findings of a threshold wind velocity at approximately 7 in s(-1);
   (ii) greater crodibility in burned vs. unburned shrubland as indicated
   by erosion thresholds, aerodynamic roughness, and nearground soil
   movement; and (iii) burned shrubland lost soil from intercanopy and
   especially canopy patches in contrast to unburned shrubland, where soil
   accumulated in canopy patches. Our results are among the first to
   quantify post-fire wind erosion and highlight the importance of
   accounting for finer temporal and spatial variation in shrubland wind
   erosion. This finer-scale variation relates to semiarid land
   degradation, and is particularly relevant for predictions of contaminant
   resuspension and redistribution, both of which historically ignore
   finer-scale temporal and spatial variation in wind erosion.}},

Abstract = {{As a practical forest fuel-reduction technique, prescribed fires have
   been implemented in many countries regardless of their potential impact
   on surface soil erosion process. Greater runoff and surface soil erosion
   (rill and inter-rill) after these forest fires is facilitated by the
   lack of vegetative ground cover on the soil surface and the degradation
   of soil physical characteristics. Here, the effects of different forest
   surface fire intensities and slope levels on surface soil erosion were
   studied by using 5-m x 2-m runoff plots. Specifically, three prescribed
   (controlled) burn sites, one on a high (53\%) and two on low (11\% and
   12\%) slope areas in old stands of Pinus nigra trees, were subjected to
   high (1596 kW/m) and low (567 kW/m and 797 kW/m) fire intensities. The
   experimental field study was conducted in 2013-2015 in the Kunduz
   Province, Vezirkopru District in Samsun, Turkey. To achieve replication
   within each site, three runoff plots were installed within each burn
   site, and three other runoff plots in their adjacent control (i.e.,
   unburned) areas. A total of 18 surface runoff plots were located on the
   ground to collect the water samples, which were measured for their
   volume and picked up after each severe precipitation event, or monthly
   when runoff had accumulated in the collecting buckets. Results showed
   that surface soil loss occurred even with the effects of low intensity
   of fire under high slope level; however, the effects were not marked
   with significant differences in the low-slope areas regardless of fire
   intensity. Therefore, our study suggests that surface prescribed forest
   fires could be used as a management tool to reduce the build-up of
   forest fuel loads, especially in those low-sloping areas with a low
   potential of surface soil erosion.}},

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-176}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a complex physical and ecological process and one that has
   dramatically affected New Zealand's landscapes and ecosystems in the
   post-settlement era. Prior to human settlement in the late 13th century,
   the Holocene palaeoenvironmental record suggests that fire frequencies
   were low across most of New Zealand, with the notable exception of some
   wetland systems. Because few of New Zealand's indigenous plant species
   show any real adaptation to fire, the greatly increased fire activity
   that accompanied human settlement resulted in widespread, and in some
   cases permanent, shifts in the composition, structure and function of
   many terrestrial ecosystems. The combined effects of Maori and European
   fire have left long-lasting legacies in New Zealand's landscapes with
   the most obvious being the reduction of forest cover from 85-90\% to
   25\% of the land area. Here we review the long-term ecological history
   of fire in New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems and describe what is
   known about the fire ecology of New Zealand's plant species and
   communities, highlighting key uncertainties and areas where future
   research is required. While considerable emphasis has been placed on
   describing and understanding the `initial burning period' that
   accompanied Maori arrival, much less ecological emphasis has been placed
   on the shifts in fire regime that occurred during the European period,
   despite the significant effects these had. Post-fire successional
   trajectories have been described for a number of wetland and forest
   communities in New Zealand, but in contemporary landscapes are
   complicated by the effects of exotic mammalian species that act as seed
   and seedling predators and herbivores, reduced pollination and dispersal
   services due to declines in the avifauna, and the presence of
   pyrophyllic exotic plant species. Many invasive plant species (e.g.
   Pinus spp., Acacia spp., Hakea spp., Ulex europaeus) are favoured by
   fire and now co-occur with indigenous plant species in communities whose
   long-term composition and trajectory are unclear. On the other hand,
   some highly-valued ecosystems such as tussock grasslands may require
   recurrent fire for their long-term persistence. Combined, the direct and
   indirect effects of the introduction of anthropic fire to New Zealand
   may have shifted large areas into successional `traps' from which, in
   the face of recurrent fire, escape is difficult. Developing appropriate
   management strategies in such a context requires a nuanced understanding
   of the place of fire in New Zealand's ecosystems.}},

   vegetation gradient parallel to ground elevation. We also studied the
   correlations between the rates and biotic (initial numbers of trees and
   initial basal area) and abiotic parameters (altimetric quota). We
   verified that recruitment was higher than mortality, and the gain of
   basal area was higher than the loses. This result suggests that the
   forest is expanding, with gain in number of individuals and in basal
   area. Normally, this result characterizes forests in recuperation after
   some disturbance. The community sectors (basis, middle and top of didn't

Abstract = {{Fire suppression has removed an important ecological force previously

   Upland areas of north-central Mississippi that have been protected from
   fire are now closed-canopy forests including species known to be

   Anecdotal evidence suggests that warm-season grasses were prevalent in
   the understory of these communities, which could have provided more
   consistent fuel. We corroborate the historic presence of these grasses
   by looking at their natural co-occurrence with oak regeneration (a
   requisite of self-replacing stands of oaks found historically).
   Restoration of these communities has typically focused on burning and
   off-site tree thinning. Utilizing a restoration experiment implementing
   these treatments, we found significantly reduced understory leaf litter
   in treatment areas. To test which variables associated with restoration
   treatments were most important for the survival of these grasses, we
   measured the effect of leaf litter removal and its interaction with
   environmental conditions on the survival of transplanted shoots.
   Survival of little bluestem increased with decreasing canopy density and
   decreasing leaf litter. Leaf-litter removal did not increase survival,

Abstract = {{Wildlife managers use spring prescribed burns to set back succession in
   managed grasslands throughout the prairie pothole region. Yet,
   prescribed burns are expensive and weather dependent. Autumn biomass
   harvest of native prairie plants may also simulate natural disturbances
   and help prevent the invasion of woody species. As such, biomass harvest
   can be an attractive management option that can augment, and in some
   cases, replace spring burning programs. We compared vegetation
   characteristics (vegetation ht and density, and residual litter depth)
   and changes to the plant community (e.g., species richness, relative
   abundance of native and exotic plant species) in restored native
   grasslands of Minnesota, during 2007-2009, in response to spring
   prescribed burns and autumn biomass harvest. We used a randomized block
   design to control for site-to-site variability, and compared treatments
   using mixed models that accounted for this source of variation as well
   as within-plot repeated measures. This framework also allowed us to
   consider additional variables (e.g., Julian date, yr effects) thought to
   influence response patterns, and also additional fields that were
   treated with an autumn biomass harvest during the same time period.
   Vegetation characteristics exhibited substantial site-to-site and
   temporal variability, but, with the exception of litter depths,
   vegetation characteristics were largely similar in biomass harvest and
   burned subplots. We conclude that autumn biomass harvests deserve more
   consideration as a potential grassland management tool. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{We examined the current composition and structure of a woodland in
   northeastern Illinois and evaluated the early effect of two prescribed
   bums. In an effort to increase white oak (Quercus alba L.) regeneration,
   managers are reintroducing fire into the woodland understory. We
   assessed canopy species and compared understory vegetation and light,
   along with soil nutrient characteristics, between a burned and an
   unburned area. In addition, we monitored transplanted white oak
   seedlings to better understand their growth and survivorship in the
   woodland. The canopy was dominated by white oak, but non-oak species,
   particularly slippery elm (Ulmus rubra Muh1.), ash (Fraxinus spp. Q, and
   black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), dominated the smaller size
   classes. There were no differences in woody and herbaceous vegetation,
   soil, and light characteristics between the burned and unburned area.
   White oak regeneration was poor which appeared to be due to low
   understory light levels associated with high density of the shrub
   prickly ash (Zanthoxylum americanum Mill.) and high numbers of non-oak
   saplings. Transplanted seedlings also performed poorly, with low
   survival rates throughout the woodland as a whole. Mammalian herbivory
   is a likely cause of additional stress to white oak regeneration.
   Evidence of browsing of transplanted white oak seedlings was apparent
   throughout the study area. If white oak is to be a component of the
   future woodland, managers should consider: (1) implementing a more
   intensive management program aimed at reducing competition from non-oak
   species and (2) increasing light in the understory.}},

   .2. EFFECTS ON NUTRIENT DYNAMICS AND NET LOSSES IN STREAMWATER}},

Abstract = {{Streamwater chemistry was monitored for five years in six streams in a
   paired catchment experiment in Mendolong, Sabah, Malaysia, comparing the
   effects of different ways to establish forest plantations with Acacia
   mangium. At the start of the monitoring in 1985 three catchments were
   covered with selectively logged rain forest (W4- W6) and three with
   secondary vegetation after forest fire (W1-W3). The treatments were: (1)
   clearing of secondary vegetation, burning and planting (W1 and W2); (2)
   clear-felling, crawler tractor extraction, burning and planting (W5);
   and (3) clear-felling, manual extraction, no burning and planting (W4).
   W3 and W6, with no treatment, were monitored as control catchments.
   Reference monitoring at all streams was for two years and was followed
   by treatments which lasted for nine months before the full establishment
   of a new vegetation cover. This paper covers monitoring for a further
   2.5 years. The soil types of the catchments were Orthic Acrisol in W3,
   Gleyic Podsol in W6 and a mix of both soil types in the other
   catchments.
   The effect of treatments on streamwater chemistry was clear at both
   base- and stormflows. Concentrations of major plant nutrients (N, P and
   K) became positively correlated to streamflow during treatments. The
   response of leaching from slash at clear-felling was fast and larger
   from the clear-felling residues (W4 and W5) than the cleared secondary
   vegetation (W1 and W2). The intense response to burning was more marked.
   The stormflow period mean nutrient concentrations were approximately
   10-fold for N and K and 10 - 100 fold for P after burning compared with
   baseflow mean concentrations over the same period. Significant
   differences in baseflow concentrations in treated streams generally
   lasted one year for most elements, but elevated concentrations were
   still detectable after three years. The first large pulse of leaching
   was related to mineralization after tree-felling and particularly
   burning. The longer lasting elevated concentrations in baseflow were
   associated with the loss of weathering products.
   The amounts of nutrients lost, calculated by regression analysis as the
   effect of treatment compared with control, were found to be higher with
   the degree of vegetation killed and with increased soil disturbance.
   Consequently, normal forestry practices, with crawler tractor extraction
   and burning before planting, created the largest leaching losses. The
   total calculated effect of losses in total N, P and K were (i) W1 + W2
   0.5, 1.8, 83-9; (ii) W4 0.8, 0-8, 105.6; and (iii) W5 1.3, 1.3, 189-4 kg
   ha-1 for the period of 33 months during and after treatment. With normal
   forestry practice using crawler tractors and with burning before
   planting (W5), the treatment-induced loss of K was equivalent to 86\% of
   the content of easily decomposed parts of the biomass (leaves, twigs,
   fine roots and ground vegetation) of the old forest, or larger than K
   removed by harvest. Exhaustion effects of lowered leaching after
   repeated burning (forest fire and pre-planting fire) was observed for
   several elements, indicating possible nutrient deficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the dynamics of forest structure aids inference regarding
   future forests and their distributions around the world. Over the last
   few decades, several papers have addressed changing forest structure in
   the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, but these studies were limited in scope. We
   carried out a broad comparison of forest density and composition in the
   1930s versus the 2000s for the west slope of the central and northern
   Sierra Nevada, using the two most extensive data sets available. Forests
   in this region have endured a long, complex history of human
   disturbance, and are now experiencing climatic shifts. We subdivided the
   landscape into elevation and latitude zones and compared historical and
   modern tree densities within each zone. We compared densities in
   historical plots to burned and unburned modern plots, as well as
   densities of individual tree species in historical vs. modern plots for
   their entire elevational distribution. Density of small trees (10.2-30.4
   cm dbh) was significantly higher in the modern data set for all
   elevations and all latitudes, ranging from 20 to 148\% higher. However,
   density of large trees (>= 61.0 cm) was lower in the modern data set for
   most elevations and latitudes, ranging from 41\% to 60\% lower in most
   zones. Density difference of mid-sized trees (30.5-60.9 cm) was mixed,
   but was generally higher in modern plots. The pattern of more small
   trees but fewer large trees held for most individual species as well,
   but with notable exceptions. Our comparison of burned and unburned plots
   strongly implicates fire suppression as a driver of increased density of
   small trees in low-to mid-elevation forests. However, modern
   high-elevation (>2500 m) forests, where fire suppression impacts should
   be minimal, were also significantly denser than historical plots.
   Changing climatic conditions may be driving increased densities of small
   trees in high elevations, as well as decreased densities of large trees
   across the region.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important driver of ecological pattern and process in
   grasslands worldwide, although its role in semi-arid systems is less
   well known. We used published studies and new experimental research to
   1) provide a synthesis of existing knowledge of fire in the semi-arid
   grasslands of the North American Great Plains, and 2) assess the degree
   of similarity in semi-arid and mesic grassland responses to fire in this
   region. Based on published studies, burning has neutral to negative
   effects on aboveground productivity in semi-arid grasslands and variable
   effects on plant communities. To more rigorously assess fire effects,
   replicated experimental plots were established in ungrazed shortgrass
   steppe in northern Colorado and prescribed spring fire was applied in
   2006 and 2007, 2006 only, or not at all. Aboveground net primary
   productivity decreased or remained unchanged with burning. Plant
   community changes included increases in perennial forbs, decreases in
   annual grasses and a positive response in annual forbs to the
   combination of fire and a wet spring in 2007. Combined, these results
   indicate that post-fire changes in productivity in semi-arid grasslands
   are neutral to negative, in contrast to positive responses in mesic
   grasslands, and not strongly negative as previously assumed. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the importance of burned habitat characteristics as
   well as the likely dispersal from specific habitats in the distribution
   of saproxylic beetles the same year as a fire occurred, in burned black
   spruce stands (Picea mariana {[}Mill] B.S.P.) in the northern boreal
   forest of Quebec. The distribution of early post-fire saproxylic species
   was mainly driven by burned habitat attributes at the plot scale (0.04
   ha), especially fire severity, suggesting that the effect of environment
   attributes can act at a relatively fine scale. Some xylophagous and most
   predaceous species were more abundant in severely burned stands whereas
   fire severity had the opposite effect on several common mycophagous
   species. The amount of newly fire-killed trees that could be used as
   breeding substrates in the burned stands had only a weak positive
   influence on these functional groups. The great majority of early
   saproxylic species were weakly associated with the distance from
   unburned forests or other recently burned patches that could act as
   potential ``source habitats{''}. Indeed, these variables were of lesser
   importance than the attributes of the burned habitat. Woody debris that
   were already present in plots before the fire, potentially serving as
   local of source-populations for early colonizers, had virtually no
   influence on the local abundance of species. Many saproxylic species,
   including some true pyrophilous, clearly showed higher abundance as
   distance from unburned stands increased. This unexpected relation may
   reflect that dispersal of insects toward the burnt landscape very
   shortly after fire could be driven by the higher amount of volatiles
   released by severely burned forests, which are more likely as distance
   from unburned forest increased. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   increased flushing of tree canopies on burnt areas, although the
   spatially patchy recovery within and between catchments points to the
   importance of other factors such as the recovery of the ground layer. It

Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{261-271}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Climate change, unpredictable dry spells and human population growth are
   expected to increase the frequency of forest fires. Forest fires induce
   damage on soil ecosystems and seriously compromise their functionality
   and provision of ecosystem services. They reduce diversity in many soil
   organism groups, although they also support flora and fauna dependent on
   fires. Fires disrupt in the cycling of nutrients, and have been argued
   to threaten the sustainability of forest biomes. However, despite these
   potentially large effects on soil ecosystems, a literature survey on the
   forest fire effects on soil fauna demonstrated that the number of
   publications on this topic between 1979 and 2013 has been surprisingly
   low compared with studies of other kinds of disturbances. A poll
   conducted among soil ecologists who actually studied forest fires
   revealed that more than 50\% of the findings about fire effects on soil
   ecosystems are unlikely to ever be published.
   The aim of this review was to discover and structure the reasons why
   forest fires are often neglected by soil zoologists and ecologists and
   to identify the major problems which deter soil zoologists from this
   area of research and from publishing obtained results. We show that
   forest fires are harder to study than many other types of disturbances.
   Fires are largely unpredictable and are often unique, which makes it
   difficult to apply statistically robust sampling plans and select proper
   controls. Spatial heterogeneity of fire intensity and soil fauna
   distribution complicate the resulting picture. Moreover, high
   variability of soil biota in time and space, and complicating effects of
   multiple fires make the results of such studies hard to interpret. We
   propose several approaches, which may help to document biodiversity and
   functional changes in soil communities affected by fire more
   effectively. These include prescribed burnings, indoor and outdoor
   experiments and meta-analyses of large datasets, including unpublished
   ones. We further justify the need for closer coordination of researchers
   to solve the ``file drawer problem{''} for the unpublished data on soil
   biota shifts in response to forest fires. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fire is known to structure tree populations, but the role of broad-scale
   climate variability is less clear. For example, the influence of
   climatic ``teleconnections'' (the relationship between
   oceanic-atmospheric fluctuations and anomalous weather patterns across
   broad scales) on forest age structure is relatively unexplored. We
   sampled semiarid pinon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma)
   woodlands in western Colorado, USA, to test the hypothesis that woodland
   age structures are shaped by climate, including links to
   oceanic-atmospheric fluctuations, and by past. res and livestock
   grazing. Low-severity surface. re was lacking, as. re scars were absent,
   and did not influence woodland densities, but stand-replacing. res
   served as long-rotation (>400-600 years), stand-initiating events.
   Old-growth stands (>300 years old) were found in 75\% of plots,
   consistent with a long. re rotation. Juniper and pinon age structures
   suggest contrasting responses during the past several centuries to dry
   and wet episodes linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)
   and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Juniper density increased
   slightly during periods of drought, positive (warm) AMO (after similar
   to 10-year lag), and negative (cool) PDO. In contrast, pinon populations
   may still be recovering from a long, drought-filled period (AD
   1620-1820), with pulses of recovery favored during cool AMO, warm PDO,
   and above-average moisture periods. Analysis of 20th-century tree
   establishment and instrumental climate data corroborate the long-term
   relationships between age structure and climate. After Euro-American
   settlement (AD 1881), livestock grazing reduced understory grasses and
   forbs, reducing competition with tree seedlings and facilitating
   climate-induced increases in pinons. Thus tree populations in these
   woodlands are in flux, affected by drought and wet periods linked to
   oceanic-atmospheric variability, Euro-American livestock grazing, and
   long-rotation, high-severity. res. Reductions in livestock grazing
   levels may aid ecological restoration efforts. However, given long-term
   fluctuations in tree density and composition, and expected further

   misdirected.}},

Abstract = {{Semiarid forests across the western USA and elsewhere are being thinned
   to reduce risk from fire, restore previous ecological conditions, and/or
   salvage trees from recently burned areas. Prescriptions and monitoring
   for thinning generally focus on biotic characteristics of vegetation,
   like tree density, rather than abiotic characteristics of soils and
   their loss, which are usually only considered in association with water
   erosion. Recent studies indicate that sediment transport by wind in
   forests is substantial and can exceed water transport, yet forest wind
   erosion responses to tree thinning and/or burning are unknown. We
   measured wind-driven horizontal dust flux, a metric related to wind
   erosion, with respect to presence/absence of fire and/or thinning in a
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in northern New Mexico, USA.
   Passive dust collectors at several sampling heights documented elevated
   dust fluxes at sites that were burned and/or thinned. Unexpectedly,
   thinned sites had erosion rates as large as burned sites, documenting
   significant restoration impacts on soil stability. Thinning and fire
   impacts on dust flux were correlated with remaining tree or ground
   cover. The results highlight that dust fluxes provide a readily
   measurable metric of soil stability that should be integrated into
   prescription and monitoring plans for forest restoration and thinning.

   contorta saplings were second in density to P. engelmannii in the
   moderate and severely burned stands, respectively. The understory shrub
   and herbaceous species that were most abundant during the first 17 years
   were common the first year after the fire and were also found in the
   unburned mature forest. Species present in the unburned forest
   contributed 91-100\% of the understory cover in the moderate burn, and
   55-74\% in the severe burn. Species richness was greatest in the
   severely burned stand and has increased during the 17 years of
   succession. While sprouting is the primary mechanism for understory
   plant establishment in the moderate burn, most species appear to have
   grown from seeds in the severe burn.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the seed ecology of Iliamna longisepala as an aid to
   developing a conservation strategy for this rare endemic forb of
   northcentral Washington. We conducted field, greenhouse, and laboratory
   studies to quantify: (1) densities of buried viable seed among sites
   with different histories of burning, (2) post-fire spatial distributions
   of germinants relative to reproductive plants and burn severity, (3)
   seed production and its annual variation, and (4) germination
   requirements. Density of seed in the soil was not significantly related
   to history of burning, but sites that experienced fire 10 years before
   sampling averaged 10 times as many seeds as sites that burned recently
   and four times as many seeds as sites that had not burned within 50
   years. Density of viable seeds in the soil did not correlate with
   density of reproductive plants. In a field experiment, germinants
   appeared after fall burning, but not after spring burning. Germinants
   were most abundant within 10 m of reproductive plants and were
   concentrated in areas of high burn severity. Seed production per plant
   was significantly correlated to crown diameter, but production varied
   dramatically from year to year. Experimental germination trials were
   largely unsuccessful due to low (8\%) viability of seeds collected from
   mature plants. However, field studies illustrate that fire is sufficient
   to break the dormancy of seeds that have accumulated in the soil.
   Long-term exclusion of fire may lead to local extinction of populations
   as the longevity of reproductive plants and seeds are exceeded. However,
   burning more frequently than every 10 years could deplete local seed
   reserves.}},

Pages = {{903-913}},
Abstract = {{Forests adapted to frequent-fire regimes are being treated to reduce
   fuel hazards and restore ecosystem processes. The maintenance of
   treatment effects under future climates is a critical issue. We modelled
   forest change under different climate scenarios for 100 years on
   ponderosa pine landscapes in the south-western USA, comparing management
   regimes that included prescribed burning, tree cutting, and
   no-management. We applied the Forest Vegetation Simulator (1) in its
   standard form, and (2) with modifications of reduced tree growth and
   increased mortality to simulate the effects of two levels of climate
   change. Without climate change effects, several management regimes,
   including the use of frequent burning similar to the historical fire
   frequency (similar to 5 year), maintained future forest structure within
   a target range of variability. In contrast, simulations that accounted
   for climate change effects indicated that burning intervals should be
   lengthened (similar to 20 year) and future tree thinning should be
   avoided to minimise forest decline. Although it has been widely
   predicted that future climate conditions will support more burning
   (warmer, drier fuels, longer fire season), our modelling suggests that
   the production of fuels will decline, so there will eventually be a
   trade-off between increased fire, driven by climate, v. reduced fuel,
   also driven by climate.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and wildfire are interacting to drive vegetation change
   and potentially reduce water quantity and quality in the southwestern
   United States, Forest restoration is a management approach that could
   mitigate some of these negative outcomes. However, little information
   exists on how restoration combined with climate change might influence
   hydrology across large forest landscapes that incorporate multiple
   vegetation types and complex fire regimes. We combined spatially
   explicit vegetation and fire modeling with statistical water and
   sediment yield models for a large forested landscape (335,000 ha) on the
   Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona, USA. Our objective was to assess the
   impacts of climate change and forest restoration on the future fire
   regime, forest vegetation, and watershed outputs. Our model results
   predict that the combination of climate change and high-severity fire
   will drive forest turnover, biomass declines, and compositional change
   in future forests. Restoration treatments may reduce the area burned in
   high-severity fires and reduce conversions from forested to non-forested
   conditions. Even though mid-elevation forests are the targets of
   restoration, the treatments are expected to delay the decline of
   high-elevation spruce-fir, aspen, and mixed conifer forests by reducing
   the occurrence of high-severity fires that may spread across ecoregions.
   We estimate that climate-induced vegetation changes will result in
   annual runoff declines of up to 10\%, while restoration reduced or
   reversed this decline. The hydrologic model suggests that mid-elevation
   forests, which are the targets of restoration treatments, provide around
   80\% of runoff in this system and the conservation of mid- to
   high-elevation forests types provides the greatest benefit in terms of
   water conservation. We also predict that restoration treatments will
   conserve water quality by reducing patches of high-severity fire that
   are associated with high sediment yield. Restoration treatments are a
   management strategy that may reduce undesirable outcomes for multiple
   ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the impacts of different traditional forest
   management types on plant diversity of the seasonal tropical rainforests
   and infer effective conservation strategies, four types of forests with
   different management histories were studied in Nabanhe National Nature
   Reserve (NNNR), Xishuangbanna. China. They were: old-growth forest
   (non-timber product collection allowed), understorey planted old-growth
   forests, old secondary forests (similar to 200-years after slash and
   burn), and young secondary forest (15-50-years after slash and burn).
   Although human activities affected tree diversity and composition of the
   forests in NNNR, the forest regeneration potential of the different
   management systems were good. Even the young secondary forests, that
   showed the lowest Fisher's alpha diversity at the plot level, had
   similar diversity levels to old-growth forest when all plots were
   combined. Number of red list tree species, timber species, and edible
   plant species in young secondary forests was as high as those of
   old-growth forests, and higher than old secondary forests. Additionally,
   there were a number of vulnerable and endangered species that were more
   common in the secondary than old-growth forests, indicating the high
   conservation value of secondary forests. Understorey plantation in
   old-growth forest, however, impaired regeneration of the climax species.
   The beneficial effects of traditional forest use depend strongly on its
   small scale and its close proximity to undisturbed forest, which serves
   as a species source during secondary forest regeneration. Unfortunately,
   traditional forest use is now under serious threat by expanding
   large-scale monoculture rubber plantations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   reconstructions of Mid- and Late Holocene climate, vegetation dynamics
   and local environmental change based on pollen, plant macrofossil and
   testate amoeba records from a site at Selikhovo (Mid-Russian Upland,
   Russia). Eutrophic fen vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis
   developed around 6800 cal year BP and has been resilient to episodes of
   local burning and variable input of mineral material through the
   Holocene. New and previously-published data show that the boundary
   between broadleaf forest and steppe occupied a similar position to
   present during the period 7000-4800 cal year BP, despite a warmer and
   drier climate, but shifted to the south following climate cooling and an
   increase in precipitation from 4800-2500 cal year BP. A subsequent
   decline in woodland cover was caused by both climate change and human
   impacts, with human activity becoming increasingly significant over the
   last two millennia. Prior to major human disturbance (about 1700 cal
   year BP) the landscape was dominated by mixed broadleaf-pine forests
   with some spruce covering about 60 \% of the study area. Our results
   emphasize the variability of steppe-forest habitats over long time

Abstract = {{In order to quantify the difference between a recently disturbed and
   undisturbed alvar woodland, thus indicating the impact of disturbance,
   and to determine differences in the effects of bulldozing and burning,
   we analyzed quadrat data and compared species lists from four
   situations: (1) a burned area 100 days after the fire, (2) the same
   burned area a little more than a year after the fire. (3) bulldozed
   tracks through unburned woodland a little more than a year after
   bulldozing, and (4) adjacent unburned woodland. Correspondence analysis
   and coordinate analysis based on distance coefficients suggested that
   the greatest differences were between unburned woodland and burned
   woodland 100 days after the fire. Bulldozed tracks and burned woodland
   more than a year after disturbance occupied an intermediate position. It
   appears that initially after a major disturbance event involving both
   removal of woody biomass and soil disturbance, mixed or
   conifer-dominated alvar woodland develops a very different plant
   community which is quickly replaced by one that more closely resembles
   the unburned woodland. Species strongly or exclusively associated with
   unburned woodland included (in descending order of suggested
   association): Abies balsamea, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Waldsteinia
   fragarioides, Rhamnus frangula, and Carex eburnea. Species particularly
   associated with unburned woodland and bulldozed tracks were: Cypripedium
   parviflorum var. pubescens. Prunella vulgaris and Bromus kalmii. At the
   other end of the scale, species associated with alvar woodland burned
   100 days earlier were (in descending order of importance): Calystegia
   spithamea, Viola cf. adunca, Populus tremuloides. Maiantheminn
   canadense, Corydalis aurea, Scutellaria parvula, Geranium bicknellii,
   Dracocephalum parviflorian, Rhus radicans ssp. negundo, and Aralia
   nudicaulis. Verbascum thapsus and Potentilla argentea and a number of
   other introduced species were uniquely associated with bulldozed tracks.
   Since burning was associated with fewer alien colonizers than
   bulldozing. it is potentially a more desirable form of disturbance
   management, but bulldozed tracks did include many native species. Alien
   species may decline over the longer term. Disturbance management,
   involving woody biomass removal and substrate disturbance, is an
   important consideration in maintaining biodivesity at both the community
   and species levels in alvar landscapes.}},

   management can influence the decisions of forest managers and NGOs
   involved' in responding to pests and diseases; however, they are rarely
   assessed directly. Evidence on the social acceptability of tree health
   management methods is required to inform government led policy and
   management. A nationally representative survey of 2000 members of the UK
   public was used to address two research questions: (1) How acceptable
   are tree health management methods to the public? (2) How do opinions
   about woodland functions, concern and awareness of tree pests and
   diseases, and demographics influence acceptance of management methods?
   We found that public stakeholders are highly supportive of tree health
   management; however, knowledge about tree pests, diseases, and
   management options is low. Methods seen as more targeted and `natural'
   were preferred, e.g. felling and burning only affected trees and using
   biological control rather than chemical control. There were demographic
   differences in attitudes: men and older people are more likely to
   support management interventions and stronger management methods than
   females and younger people. Acceptance of management can also differ
   according to location and local context (e.g. management is less
   supported when it may impact on wildlife) and values (e.g. those with
   economic values are more supportive of management). These findings
   provide evidence to support current government initiatives on tree
   health and should improve confidence amongst managers tasked with
   carrying out tree pest and disease management. However, there is a need
   for in-depth qualitative studies to explain the beliefs which influence
   demographic variations in acceptance and the influence of concepts such
   as `nativeness' and `naturalness'. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Oak savannas, once common in the Midwest, are now isolated remnants
   within agricultural landscapes. Savanna remnants are frequently
   encroached by invasive trees to become woodlands. Thinning and
   prescribed burning can restore savanna structure, but the
   ecohydrological effects of managing these remnants are poorly
   understood. In this study, we measured sap flow (J(s)) to quantify
   transpiration in an Iowa bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) savanna woodland
   encroached by elms (Ulmus americana), and in an adjacent restored
   savanna after thinning to remove elms, during summer 2004. Savanna oaks
   had greater mean daily J(s) (35.9 L dm(-2) day(-1)) than woodland oaks
   (20.7 L dm(-2) day(-1)) and elms (12.4 L dm(-2) day(-1)). The response
   of J(s) to vapor pressure deficit (D) was unexpectedly weak, although
   oaks in both stands showed negative correlation between daily J(s) and D
   for D > 0.4 kPa. An earlier daily peak in J(s) in the elm trees showed a
   possible advantage for water uptake. As anticipated, the woodland's
   stand transpiration was greater (1.23 nm day(-1)) than the savanna's
   (0.35 mm day(-1)), yet the savanna achieved 30\% of the woodland's
   transpiration with only 11\% of its sapwood area. The difference in
   transpiration influenced water table depths, which were 2 m in the
   savanna and 6.5 m in the woodland. Regionally, row-crop agriculture has
   increased groundwater recharge and raised water tables, providing
   surplus water that perhaps facilitated elm encroachment. This has
   implications for restoration of savanna remnants. If achieving a savanna
   ecohydrology is an aim of restoration, then restoration strategies may
   require buffers, or targeting of large or hydrologically isolated
   remnants. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Adult western jewel butterflies Hypochrysops halyaetus Hewitson were
   studied in the Koondoola Regional Bushland Reserve on the northern
   outskirts of the Perth metropolitan area, Australia, in 1999. The
   butterfly is myrmecophilous, and the southern (Perth) form is considered
   to be `Vulnerable'. Butterfly dispersal, distribution, population size
   and habitat preferences were estimated using mark-recapture techniques.
   Butterflies were capable of moving large distances, and were widespread
   within the reserve but with a low density; however, one small physical
   area (80 x 20 m) contained a colony with large numbers of individuals.
   This colony, and an adjacent area of bush, was subject to a detailed
   microdistribution study: 1158 butterflies were marked within it over a
   25-day period. The small size of the microdistribution study area
   compromised statistical independence assumptions: spatial
   autocorrelation was tested for and corrected, where appropriate, using a
   Markov-chain Monte-Carlo approach. Sex differences were evident in
   spatial autocorrelation: female data were not spatially autocorrelated,
   whilst male data was. The latter probably reflects the impact of the
   perching mode of mate location employed by males. Butterflies appeared
   to prefer rather degraded bush typical of a post fire/disturbance regime
   with high densities of the host plant Jacksonia sternbergiana. Males
   were positively correlated with the proportion of bare ground, again
   probably relating to preferred perching sites for mate location. Females
   were negatively correlated with Conospremum stoechadis probably
   indicating dense ground cover in degraded areas and Xanthorrhoea
   preissii probably an indicator at the site of more mature vegetation.
   Reserve management to improve vegetation quality may threaten the
   persistence of the butterfly within the reserve, whilst controlled
   burning to create even quite small new areas of habitat in an urban
   situation may be difficult to achieve. The creation of suitable habitat
   may be possible using mechanical means, provided the action of fire is
   not an essential component of habitat creation. As the western jewel

Abstract = {{QuestionsWhen a tree or a shrub dies, the space it occupied can be
   overtaken by plants that were recruiting beneath it or colonized by new
   species. Such replacement processes can drive the temporal change in
   species abundance in a plant community. Can we predict the dynamics of a
   real plant community using observational data on plant-plant recruitment
   interactions? What would be the relative importance of recruitment
   interactions vs life-history traits in determining community dynamics?
   LocationForest communities dominated by Pinus halepensis and Quercus
   ilex in SE Spain.
   MethodsWe develop a continuous time non-linear model that can be easily
   parameterized with empirical data for the interactions between adult and
   juvenile plants recruiting beneath them. These interactions form a
   complex replacement network (or matrix) that is the backbone of the
   model. We parameterize the model with life-history data from the
   literature and from recruitment interactions observed in a successional
   community 12yr after a forest fire. We explore the behaviour of the
   model under different intensities of chronic disturbance, and after
   modifications of the structure of the replacement network and the values
   of the parameters.
   ResultsThe model predicts that the current community of the burned area
   will develop into a forest very similar quantitatively to the
   surrounding mature forests, as long as the rates of chronic disturbance
   remain very low. For increasingly higher levels of chronic disturbance,
   the community would reach stable states resembling a mixed pine-oak
   forest, a degraded oak forest, an oak dehesa and, finally, a steppe-like
   vegetation. All these types of plant assemblages can currently be found
   throughout the study area. These predictions are less sensitive to
   variation in the estimates of species' life history (i.e. growth, death
   and colonization rates) than to variation in the structure of the
   recruitment matrix.
   ConclusionsThe model projects realistic community dynamics. The analysis
   of the model suggest that understanding the structure of replacement
   networks and how they are assembled can contribute significantly to our
   knowledge of the dynamics and stability of forest plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta, Dougl.) was introduced to New Zealand in
   about 1880. It is the most vigorous naturally regenerating introduced
   conifer, which has led to large areas of unwanted spread or `wildings'.
   Wildings threaten existing indigenous flora and fauna, visual landscape
   and land use values. The area affected by all conifer natural
   regeneration is estimated at 150,000 ha of which approximately two
   thirds is lodgepole pine. Control operations have been undertaken in New
   Zealand since the 1960s. The high `weed' potential of lodgepole pine,
   coupled with its low grower and market acceptance in New Zealand, means
   that the species is seldom planted nowadays.
   Lodgepole pine spreads more Vigorously than other introduced conifers as
   it cones earlier, is capable of producing seed and wildings at higher
   altitudes, and has lighter seed allowing dispersal over wide areas.
   Spread occurs most readily on ungrazed land with low vegetation density,
   and is least likely to occur in intact, dense vegetation, or where
   intensive grazing is practiced. Direction and distance of spread from
   parent trees is predictable. Most wildings occur initially as fringe
   spread within 50 m downwind of parent trees. Distant spread (measured in
   kilometers) is usually associated with trees on take-off sites exposed
   to the wind, such as hilltops and ridges. Spread commonly occurs in
   `waves', about once every 5 years for fringe spread, and once every
   10-20 years for distant spread.
   Research on seed production, dissemination and the factors influencing
   seedling establishment has resulted in the development of strategies for
   the prevention and control of spread. The major aspects to consider for
   new plantings are siting, planting design and surrounding land
   management. Where large areas of spread exist, containment is often the
   most practical recommendation. Eradication is by burning, hand pulling
   (small seedlings only), felling and application of chemicals to stumps
   or foliage.
   Lodgepole pine was the first conifer to attract significant adverse
   attention due to its propensity for natural regeneration, but concern
   about the spread of introduced conifers is now general, especially in
   the hill and high country grasslands of the eastern South Island. This
   concern has been promoted by new `effects-based' resource management
   legislation which is currently being implemented by territorial
   authorities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Patterns of woodboring beetle activity following fires and bark beetle
   outbreaks in montane forests of California, USA}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Increasingly frequent and severe drought in the western
   United States has contributed to more frequent and severe wildfires,
   longer fire seasons, and more frequent bark beetle outbreaks that kill
   large numbers of trees. Climate change is expected to perpetuate these
   trends, especially in montane ecosystems, calling for improved
   strategies for managing Western forests and conserving the wildlife that
   they support. Woodboring beetles (e.g., Buprestidae and Cerambycidae)
   colonize dead and weakened trees and speed succession of habitats
   altered by fire or bark beetles, while serving as prey for some
   early-seral habitat specialists, including several woodpecker species.
   To understand how these ecologically important beetles respond to
   different sources of tree mortality, we sampled woodborers in 16 sites
   affected by wildfire or bark beetle outbreak in the previous one to
   eight years. Study sites were located in the Sierra Nevada, Modoc
   Plateau, Warner Mountains, and southern Cascades of California, USA. We
   used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate hypotheses concerning
   the response of woodboring beetles to disturbance type, severity, and
   timing; forest stand composition and structure; and tree
   characteristics.
   Results: Woodborer activity was often similar in burned and bark beetle
   outbreak sites, tempered by localized responses to bark beetle activity,
   burn severity, tree characteristics, and apparent response to ignition
   date. Larval woodborer activity was inversely related to bark beetle
   sign within a sampling quadrat, was higher on pines, and-in burned
   sites-was higher on the south-facing sides of smaller trees.
   Adults-especially buprestids-were more abundant where burn severity was
   higher. Fires with intermediate ignition dates during the study period
   supported higher rates of larval woodborer activity and higher numbers
   of adult buprestids as well as cerambycids in the genus Monochamus
   Dejean 1821.
   Conclusions: Woodboring beetle abundance was related to bark beetle
   activity, burn severity, tree characteristics, and ignition date.
   Considering these patterns when managing disturbed forest stands could
   yield improved outcomes for wildlife, including species that prey on
   woodboring beetles. We also reported preliminary evidence that the
   current trend toward more frequent wildfires might not stimulate larger
   woodboring beetle populations if those fires increasingly occur outside
   the historical fire season.}},

Abstract = {{Trees may be retained on logged sites in eucalypt forests for a number
   of reasons, such as to provide wildlife habitat, for future wood
   production, for aesthetic reasons, to mitigate erosion, or to provide
   seed for regeneration. These trees may be required to survive for a
   considerable period to meet these objectives. Logged sites in eucalypt
   forests are routinely treated with a post-logging slash-burn to reduce
   fuel loads and facilitate regeneration. We compared rates of mortality
   and collapse among trees retained on logged sites that were routinely
   treated with a high-intensity slash-burn with logged sites routinely
   treated with a low-intensity slash-burn. All observations were made 2-5
   years after logging. The proportion of all retained trees that were
   killed after logging was 37\% on sites treated with a high-intensity
   slash-burn and 14\% on sites treated with a low-intensity slash-burn.
   The rate of collapse among retained trees over the same period was 1.5
   and 0.5\%, respectively Results of logistic regression models indicated
   that trees retained on logged sites were more likely to die and collapse
   if the site was treated with a high-intensity slash-burn; however, trees
   were also more likely to die if the basal area of trees retained on the
   site was relatively low and the site had a northerly aspect. Mortality
   was similar among all diameter classes on sites treated with a
   high-intensity slash-burn. Some of the objectives of retaining trees on
   logged sites, such as perpetuating hollow-bearing trees for wildlife,
   may be compromised where high-intensity post-logging slash-burns are

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Drivers of species productivity and ecosystem function are of great
   ecological significance. In fire-prone ecosystems, dispersion patterns
   of important pollinator species are driven by the various fire events
   over space and time. However, different species have varying responses
   to fire intensity and frequency. Here, we assess how time since last
   fire influences abundance, composition, and dispersion patterns of
   flowering plants and anthophiles in a highly fire-prone landscape. We
   classified study area into age since last fire, which were <1 yr
   (short-term burned), 2-3 yr (medium-term burned), and 9-10 yr (long-term
   burned). We collected insect anthophiles using yellow, blue, and white
   pan traps at sites established in each post-fire class. We also
   estimated flower abundance at each study site. Overall, anthophile
   abundance was highest in medium-term burned, while lowest in short-term
   burned sites. Also, flower abundance was highest at medium-term burned
   and lowest in long-term burned sites. Species composition of flowering
   plants and anthophiles, especially bees and flies, differed
   significantly across post-fire class. Overall, flower abundance had a
   significant positive effect on bee abundance. Of all the taxa, bees were
   the only group that showed dispersion patterns reflecting those of
   flower abundance. Other factors, especially requirements for other
   resources such as logs, drive the distribution of other anthophile taxa,
   especially flies. We conclude that fire drives the distribution patterns
   of bees through its direct effect on flower abundance and composition in
   a fire-prone landscape. While high frequency of short-term fire may
   reduce flower abundance, flower-rich areas with moderate time since fire
   may increase diversity of anthophiles in this fire-prone landscape.}},

Title = {{Strong Legacy Effects of Prior Burn Severity on Forest Resilience to a
   High-Severity Fire}},
Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Legacy effects from one disturbance may influence successional pathways
   by amplifying or buffering forest regeneration after the next
   disturbance. We assessed vegetation and tree regeneration in
   non-serotinous Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contortavar.murrayana)
   stands after a 1984 wildfire which burned with variable severity and
   again after a high-severity subsequent fire in 2012. The legacy effects
   of the 1984 fire were amplified; seedlings and saplings were abundant in
   areas initially burned at low severity (1267 stems ha(-1)) despite high
   reburn severity, but regeneration was low in areas twice burned at high
   severity (31 stems ha(-1)). Our results suggest that the severity of the
   1984 fire may have influenced post-2012 tree regeneration by creating
   variable fuel loading, which may have affected soils, litter cover and
   shade after the 2012 fire and therefore affected seedling establishment
   and survival. A canopy seed bank of unburnt cones from trees killed by
   the 2012 fire potentially contributed to a strong effect of prior burn
   severity on regeneration after the 2012 fire despite a lack of
   serotinous or resprouting tree species, although the influence of this
   canopy seedbank was likely limited to the year following the fire. Our
   results suggest that a low- to moderate-severity fire increases forest
   resilience relative to a high-severity fire even when the next fire
   burns at high severity.}},

   level at the basin outlet are exploited, while uncertainty is considered

   Rs in the low burning severity plots decreased by 19\%, while it

Abstract = {{Lantana (Lantana camara L., Verbenaceae) is an invasive species of
   global interest that threatens more than 300 Australian plant and animal
   species of conservation significance. Reptiles may be at high risk due
   to their ground-dwelling habit and reliance on microhabitat structure.
   We examined the effects of lantana, and its management, on reptile
   assemblages in a wet sclerophyll forest in southeast Queensland,
   Australia. We compared reptile assemblages across four treatments: (i)
   manual clearing and herbicide application; (ii) herbicide application
   followed by prescribed burn; (iii) untreated lantana thickets; and (iv)
   wet sclerophyll forest. Plots treated with herbicide and then burned
   were structurally more diverse than manually cleared sites and supported
   a greater diversity of reptiles. No species occurred exclusively in
   untreated lantana habitats; however, these plots supported relatively
   high abundances of rare species, particularly Challenger Skinks
   (Saproscincus rosei). Lantana also had a higher species richness
   compared to manually cleared and sclerophyll forest. The use of lantana
   as habitat by a number of species highlights the need to consider the
   importance of these habitats for fauna prior to implementing management
   options. Herbicide application followed by prescribed burning appears to
   be an ideal approach to manage lantana due to the increased
   heterogeneity and regrowth of native vegetation, an option which
   supported more diverse reptile communities. Our results caution against
   the whole scale clearing of lantana from invaded areas, as these
   habitats continue to support reptile communities including threatened
   species. Nevertheless, by treating lantana with herbicide and prescribed
   fire, reptile community structure might be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{On the dry, flat, jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.)-dominated ecosystems
   of the northern Lake States and eastern Canada, wildfire behavior often
   produces narrow, remnant strips of unburned trees that provide
   heterogeneity on a landscape historically shaped by stand-replacing
   wildfires. We used landscape metrics to analyze a chronosequence of
   aerial imagery to examine these ``stringers{''} of mature trees within
   historical wildfires in northern Lower Michigan. Our major objective was
   to describe the natural range of variability of stringer patterns and
   their persistence and change during the fire-free interval. Field
   studies were then used to examine stringer composition and structural
   variability. Stringers were found to occur in all fires >1000 ha, in
   about one-third of wildfires >80 ha, but never in fires <80 ha, likely
   because of the lack of fire intensity on smaller fires that is necessary
   for stringers to be formed. Stringers were typically composed of many
   small, well-aggregated patches that represented 3-14\% of the area
   within the burn perimeter, and stringer formation was relatively
   independent of pre-fire forest structure or composition. Stringer
   patterns changed mostly in the first decade after the fire that created
   them and then stabilized. Major changes that occurred in stringer
   patterns after this period were most often due to human activities,
   highlighting their natural persistence through the fire-free interval.
   The historical persistence and importance of these features also
   highlights their importance on modern fire-prone landscapes,
   particularly in northern Lower Michigan where a high proportion of land
   management is focused on jack pine plantations for breeding habitat for

Abstract = {{Wildfire is the predominant natural disturbance in the boreal forests of
   western Canada. Natural disturbance based forest management involves the
   use of retention harvesting to retain stand structural diversity after
   harvest; however, unlike fire, this partial harvesting technique does
   not cause combustion of the forest floor. Application of prescribed
   burning to areas treated with retention harvesting might emulate the
   influence of wildfires more effectively than harvesting alone. We
   compared understory vascular plant diversity, abundance, and composition
   between forest stands subjected to dispersed retention harvesting (10\%
   retention) with and without prescribed burning 1, 6, and 11 or 12 years
   after burning. Untreated forest was included as a reference. Research
   was conducted in conifer-dominated, mixedwood, and deciduous-dominated
   boreal forest stands in northwestern Alberta, Canada. In
   deciduous-dominated stands, burned areas of retention harvested stands
   had higher species richness and greater cover than did unburned areas.
   In all three forest cover types, effects of harvest with and without
   burn on species richness, cover, and composition were still evident a
   decade after disturbance. Fire-adapted species benefited most from the
   prescribed burn treatment. The combination of prescribed burning with
   retention harvesting can be considered a useful option in forest
   management that aims to emulate natural disturbance.}},

Title = {{How does forest recovery following moderate-severity fire influence
   effects of subsequent wildfire in mixed-conifer forests?}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Given regional increases in fire activity in western North
   American forests, understanding how fire influences the extent and
   effects of subsequent fires is particularly relevant. Remotely sensed
   estimates of fire effects have allowed for spatial portioning into
   different severity categories based on the degree of fire-caused
   vegetation change. Fire effects between minimal overstory tree mortality
   (< 20\%) and complete (or nearly complete) overstory tree mortality (>
   95\%) are often lumped into a single category referred to as moderate
   severity. In this paper, we investigated how burned areas in this broad
   category of moderate-severity fire fared when reburned by a subsequent
   fire. Specifically, we examined the influence of forest structure, tree
   species composition, and shrub cover 9-17 yr following moderate-severity
   fire on the severity of a subsequent large wildfire event. We used
   plot-based measurements of trees and shrub cover to develop 15 forest
   structure and composition variables to attempt to explain observed
   reburn severity.
   Results: Only live Abies Mill. species basal area and dead standing
   biomass were identified as significant predictors of reburn severity
   using conditional inference tree analysis, both of which were positively
   related to reburn severity.
   Conclusion: Our findings emphasize that the wide range of fire effects
   in the moderate-severity category can contribute to highly variable
   responses to subsequent wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration and management activities targeted at recovering
   biodiversity can lead to unexpected results. In part, this is due to a
   lack of understanding of how site-level characteristics, landscape
   factors, and land-use history interact with restoration and management
   practices to determine patterns of diversity. For plants, such factors
   may be particularly important since plant populations often exhibit
   lagged responses to habitat loss and degradation. Here, we assess the
   importance of site-level, landscape, and historical effects for
   understory plant species richness and composition across a set of 40
   longleaf pine Pinus palustris woodlands undergoing restoration for the
   federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the southeastern United
   States. Land-use history had an overarching effect on richness and
   composition. Relative to historically forested sites, sites with
   agricultural histories (i.e. former pastures or cultivated fields)
   supported lower species richness and an altered species composition due
   to fewer upland longleaf pine woodland community members. Landscape
   effects did not influence the total number of species in either
   historically forested or post-agricultural sites; however, understory
   species composition was affected by historical connectivity, but only
   for post-agricultural sites. The influences of management and
   restoration activities were only apparent once land-use history was
   accounted for. Prescribed burning and mechanical overstory thinning were
   key drivers of understory composition and promoted understory richness
   in post-agricultural sites. In historically forested sites these
   activities had no impact on richness and only prescribed fire influenced
   composition. Our findings reveal complex interplays between site-level,
   landscape, and historical effects, suggest fundamentally different
   controls over plant communities in longleaf pine woodlands with varying
   land-use history, and underscore the importance of considering land-use
   history and landscape effects during restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires burn approximately 1\% of boreal forest yearly, being one of
   the most significant factors affecting soil organic matter (SOM) pools.
   Boreal forests are largely situated in the permafrost zone, which
   contains half of global soil carbon (C). Wildfires advance thawing of
   permafrost by burning the insulating organic layer and decreasing
   surface albedo, thus increasing soil temperatures. Fires also affect SOM
   quality through chemical and physical changes, such as the formation of
   resistant C compounds. The long-term post-fire effects on SOM quality,
   degradability and isotopic composition are not well known in permafrost
   forests. We studied the effect of forest fires on the proportional sizes
   of SOM pools with chemical fractionation (extracting with water, ethanol
   and acid) of soil samples (5, 30 and 50cm depths) collected from a fire
   chronosequence in the upland mineral soils of the Canadian permafrost
   zone. We also determined the C-13 and N-15 isotopic composition of soil
   after fire. In the topsoil horizon (5cm) recent fire areas contained a
   smaller fraction of labile SOM and were slightly more enriched with N-15
   and C-13 than older fire areas. The SOM fraction ratios reverted towards
   pre-fire status with succession. Changes in SOM were less apparent
   deeper in the soil. Best predictors for the size of recalcitrant SOM
   fraction were active layer depth, vegetation biomass and soil C/N ratio,
   whereas microbial biomass was best predicted by the size of the
   recalcitrant SOM fraction. Results indicated that SOM in upland mineral
   soils at the permafrost surface could be mainly recalcitrant and its
   decomposition not particularly sensitive to changes resulting from fire.}},

Abstract = {{Patagonia is commonly seen as an exceptionally pristine area because of
   its wildlife and practically unpolluted waters. However, during the
   twentieth century the burning of natural forests was one of the most
   important human activities in Northern Chilean Patagonia. Some
   estimations indicate that three million hectares were burned during the
   first three decades of the century. Hence the objective of this study
   was to evaluate the impacts of the historical fires in Lake Burgos
   (45A(0)42'S) and Lake Thompson (45A(0)38'S) in Chilean Patagonia. The
   impact was measured by evaluating chironomid assemblage since they are
   sensitive enough to be used as an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health.
   Fires have a direct and drastic effect on a lake watershed but also
   indirectly affect a lake ecosystem, changing sedimentation patterns or
   increasing nutrient inputs. In the studied lakes the periods with higher
   prevalence of fires were identified by charcoal analysis, while organic
   matter and magnetic susceptibility allowed the confirmation of pre-fire
   and post-fire periods. The chironomid composition was evaluated through
   a PCA and an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) to test the significance
   among periods while a Detrended Correspondence Analysis was applied to
   the chironomid assemblage downcore to assess compositional structure and
   taxa turnover. In Lake Burgos the ANOSIM test indicated significant
   differences between the pre-fire and fire periods (p < 0.05), while in
   Lake Thompson differences were not significant. However, in Lake
   Thompson the PCA clearly separated the pre-fire from the fire period but
   not the fire from the post-fire periods. In both lakes chironomid
   composition changed in relation to the period of higher prevalence of
   fires, which in turn implies catchment changes, pollution, and other
   anthropogenic impacts. Particularly a marked change in
   mesotrophic/eutrophic taxa was detected, reflecting an increase in
   nutrient input due to deforestation. Our findings point out that the
   lacustrine ecosystems are still affected by the impact of fires and the
   subsequent increase in nutrient supply that occurred almost 50 years
   ago. No sign of reverting to pre-disturbance conditions was observed,
   which makes these lakes highly sensitive to current human-induced
   impacts.}},

   texture influenced vegetation composition and abundance independently of
   fire variables and was generally a more important control on floristic
   patterns. Total species richness, lifeform richness and the abundance

   clay content. Linear mixed effect models with combined habitat data,

   higher on burnt blocks than unburnt blocks regardless of fire season or
   interval. These results suggest greater diversity after burning is a
   result of an increase in ephemeral species. However, the overall
   influence of fire on floristic patterns is relatively moderate and fire

Abstract = {{Key messageThe tree census, paleopollen, fossil charcoal, human
   population, and climate data presented here provide unique support for
   importantanthropogenic influences onfire over the last 2000years in the
   eastern USA. This includes multiple instances of climate fire anomalies
   that may be best explained by the role of human-caused
   burning.ContextThe coupling ofpaleoecological and tree census data to
   address larger global change questions is a novel research approach to
   describe and ascribe recent vegetation dynamics vis-a-vis the climate
   versus disturbance debate.AimsThe aims of the study are to (1) compile
   and compare pre-European settlement versus modern upland arboreal pollen
   and tree survey data from a large number of studies in various forest
   regions in the eastern USA, (2) analyze fossil charcoal dating back
   2000years for the northern versus central/southern tiers of the eastern
   USA, and (3) compare and contrast compositional and ecophysiological
   attributes for both datasets and temporal changes to known climate or
   disturbance phenomena to elucidate global change impacts and the drivers
   of forest change.MethodsWe analyzed paleoecological (pollen and
   charcoal) and tree census studies to compare protohistoric and modern
   vegetation assemblage for eastern North America, including the drivers
   of forest change. A total of seven forest types in the north and central
   regions of the eastern USA were used to co-analyze fossil pollen, fossil
   charcoal, and tree survey data.ResultsDisparities and consistencies
   existed when independently assessing witness tree and pollen records.
   Although forests north of the tension zone line (TZL) contained mostly
   Fagus, Pinus, Tsuga, and Acer witness trees, pollen records were
   dominated, as expected, by high-pollen-producing Pinus, Quercus, Tsuga,
   and Betula. Here, present-day pollen and tree survey data revealed
   significant declines in Fagus, Pinus, Tsuga, and Larix and increases in
   Acer, Populus, Fraxinus, Quercus, and Abies. South of the TZL, both
   witness tree and pollen records pointed to Quercus and Pinus domination,
   with declines in Quercus and Castanea and increases in Acer and Betula
   based on present-day data. Modern assemblages comprise tree genera
   thatare increasingly cool-adapted, shade-tolerant, drought-intolerant
   pyrophobes. Paleocharcoal data from 1 to 1750 AD indicate a slight
   increase in burning in southern forests and stable levels in the north,
   despite the increasing cold associated with the Little Ice Age. The most
   significant increase in burning followed the dramatic increase in human
   population associated with European settlement prior to the early
   twentieth century.ConclusionPost-1940, fire suppression was an
   ecologically transformative event in all datasets. Our analysis
   identifies multiple instances in which fire and vegetation changeswere
   likelydriven by shifts in human population and land use beyond those
   expected fromclimatealone.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) changes affect the CO2 atmospheric levels and
   is a key factor on soil fertility and soil erodibility. Fire affects
   ecosystems and the soil properties due to heating and post-fire soil
   erosion and degradation processes. In order to understand fire effects
   on soil organic carbon (SOC) balance, research was undertaken on a
   fire-prone ecosystem: the Mediterranean maquia. The spatial distribution
   of SOC was measured in a Burnt site 6 months after a wildfire and in a
   Control site. Samples were collected at two different depths (0-3 and
   3-10 cm) and SOC was determined. The results show that 41.8 per cent of
   the SOC stock was lost. This is due to the removal of the burnt material
   by surface wash. No significant differences in SOC content were found
   for the subsurface samples between burnt and control plots. Those
   results show that ashes and charcoal are transported by runoff
   downslope, and are subsequently deposited in the valley bottom, and this
   is the key process that contributes the burial of SOC after a forest
   fire. SOC redistribution by water erosion is accelerated after forest
   fires, and contribute to the degradation of soils located at the upper
   part of the hillslopes, but causes the enrichment with SOM of the soils
   located at the valley bottom. Buried SOC in the bottoms valley terraces
   will contribute to the sequestration of carbon for longer. Conservation
   of abandoned terraces is a key policy to avoid land degradation and

Abstract = {{Acacia nilotica is a tree of international significance both as a
   beneficial plant and as a species prone to thicket formation and
   negative impacts on savannas throughout much of its range. While fire
   has been identified as a useful tool for controlling negative impacts of
   some Acacia species in Africa, A. nilotica adult trees are apparently
   fire tolerant. The effects of fire on seed bank mortality, viability and
   germination, and on juvenile plants of this species are unknown. We
   undertook a study to investigate the impacts of fire on seeds and first
   and second year seedlings in Australian Astrebla savannas. The primary
   objective was to determine the effects of control burns applied during
   the early stages of invasion and thicket formation. Because of high
   rates of seedling dessication post fire in 1997, supplementary watering
   was undertaken until fire mortality could be measured the following
   year. High seed mortality occurred for seeds located either in cattle
   dung (100\%) or on the soil surface (c. 80\%). Germination of those
   seeds that survived was enhanced following exposure to fire. Very high
   fire mortality (99\%) was observed among first year seedlings and
   moderate mortality (60\%) for second year seedlings even after a low
   intensity burn. Negative impacts on major pasture species were minimal.
