Title = {{VARIABILITY IN FIRE PRESCRIPTIONS TO PROMOTE WILDLIFE FOODS IN THE
   LONGLEAF PINE ECOSYSTEM}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is commonly used to restore and maintain the longleaf
   pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem (LLPE). A key function of the
   LLPE is the provisioning of food for wildlife. Despite the plethora of
   literature evaluating the effects of fire season and fire-return
   interval on plant community dynamics, little attention has been given to
   the response of wildlife foods to fire season or fire-return interval.
   We measured the availability of key wildlife foods (fleshy fruit
   {[}i.e., seed containing a nutritious pericarp] and understory plant
   biomass) in upland pine forest following dormant-season
   (December-February) and growing-season (April-June) fires in a
   chronosequential design. Also, we quantified the relative contributions
   of the upland hardwood and bottomland hardwood forest types, which often
   are intentionally suppressed in the LLPE. In 2011 and 2012, we measured
   understory leafy biomass, biomass of forages selected by white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.), and soft mast production
   chronosequentially in relation to years-since-fire, fire season, and
   vegetation type in the LLPE at Fort Bragg Military Installation, North
   Carolina, USA. Understory leafy biomass increased in upland pine and
   hardwood forests as years-since-fire increased until two years post
   fire. Selected forages decreased in upland pine forest and increased in
   upland hardwood forest as time-since-fire increased. In upland pine
   forests burned during the growing season, 94 \% of the fruit was
   detected two years after fire, 6 \% one year after fire, and 0 \% the
   same year as fire. In June, fruit density was greatest in bottomland
   hardwood forest; in July, fruit density was greatest in dormant-season
   burned upland pine forest; in August, fruit density was greatest in
   upland hardwood forest; and in September, fruit density was greatest in
   upland hardwood and bottomland hardwood forest. Overall summer fruit
   density (i.e., the sum of fruit density detected each month) was
   greatest in upland hardwood forest. Understory leafy biomass and
   deer-selected forages were stable in bottomland hardwood forest because
   they were not burned, thereby providing a relatively high and stable
   availability from year to year. Our data demonstrate the importance of
   diversity in fire season and frequency, and diversity in vegetation
   types to promote key wildlife foods in the LLPE.}},

Title = {{Carbon loss during the early decomposition stages of tree stumps in a

Abstract = {{Post-fire carbon released by the decomposition process of tree stumps in
   a Spanish black pine (Pious nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii) forest of the
   Cuenca Mountain range (Spain) was assessed during the first three years
   after felling fire-killed trees. Carbon loss was estimated at high- and
   low-burn severity sites by two different ways: (1) via wood mass loss
   (indirect method); and (2) via in situ CO2 efflux measurements (R-stump,
   direct method). By the indirect method, different aboveground wood
   decomposition parameters were estimated, i.e. decay rate (k(a)) and half
   life period (t(0,5)). By the direct method, multiple regression models
   related stump diameter and temperature to instantaneous R-stump. The
   results indicate that C loss depended on post-fire environmental
   conditions and woody substrate quality (i.e. stump size). Both methods
   showed similar C release patterns, with higher values obtained by the
   direct method for all study sites and tree stump sizes, likely because a
   portion of the CO2 originating in the belowground part of stump was
   diffused through the decomposed aboveground part. Using the defined
   R-stump models for ecosystem upscaling, the annual C loss of the study
   sites ranged from 0.08 +/- 0.01 to 1.33 +/- 0.06 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1).
   Thereby, stumps could be considered hot spots of CO2 production during
   their early stages of decomposition, which particularly at post-fire
   managed areas, with large numbers are left to decompose, can represent a
   significant and poorly studied part of the total ecosystem respiration.

   following wildfire in a mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) forest}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{384}},
Pages = {{72-82}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Processes initiated by wildfire largely determine ecological
   characteristics of forested landscapes in subsequent decades, including
   vegetation composition, habitat quality, carbon balance, and probability
   of fire recurrence. Post-fire biomass dynamics have rarely been observed
   directly for high-elevation forests of the Pacific Northwest. We
   examined changes in total biomass and its components (attrition of
   coarse woody debris (CWD), growth of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and
   tree recruitment) over the first 15 years following wildfire in a
   mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) forest in Oregon, using permanent
   plots representing random samples of four levels of fire-severity, from
   unburned to >90\% tree mortality. Understory vegetation was transformed
   by fire, inasmuch as only shrubs were detected in unburned plots, while
   burned plots also had significant amounts of graminoids and forbs.
   Conifer recruitment was sparse in plots with high fire-severity two
   years after fire, but was abundant after 15 years. Recruitment was
   predominantly mountain hemlock and most were seedlings <1 m tall. The
   breakage of snags and resulting increase in logs created microsites
   (north sides of logs) conducive to tree regeneration. Mass of understory
   vegetation and conifer regeneration was far outweighed by CWD. Toppling,
   fragmentation, and advancing decay of snags resulted in a decrease in
   snag mass and an increase in log mass. The loss of snag mass exceeded
   the increase in log mass, resulting in an overall decline. For some
   portions of the burned area, particularly areas of high fire-severity,
   it may be more than a century before the growth of live trees balances
   the loss of mass of CWD. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Volume = {{407}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment of seed regenerating plants after disturbance depends on
   adequate seed supply and favourable microsites that allow germination
   and seedling establishment (safe sites). Forest disturbance in nutrient
   stressed conifer-ericaceous communities in boreal and temperate forests
   become quickly dominated by ericaceous shrubs and restrict tree
   recruitment. Habitat filter due to limitation of safe sites has been
   attributed to inadequate seedling regeneration. Furthermore, large
   proportions of the regenerating seedlings exhibit stunted growth but
   some over time exhibit growth release. Despite wide occurrence of poor
   natural regeneration of conifers in ericaceous shrubs, the ontogenic
   patterns of stunting and growth release of conifer seedlings received
   little attention. We used post-fire black spruce- Kalmia ecosystems to
   study this. We hypothesized that (i) post-fire residual OM thickness
   controls seedling recruitment by limiting safe sites even in presence of
   sufficient seed supply, (ii) black spruce density of a site depends on
   its OM depth, which controls safe sites, and (iii) partially safe sites,
   which permit germination and seedling establishment with stunted growth,
   can become safe sites overtime allowing growth release. We
   experimentally tested black spruce seed regeneration on seedbeds with
   variable OM thickness and studied the ontogenic patterns of
   seedling/sapling growth in eight post-fire Kalmia heaths along an 8-34
   year chronosequence. We found that despite ample seed supply OM depth
   controls seedling recruitment. In the chronosequence study we found only
   17.8\% of burnt area accounts for occupied safe sites, recruiting only
   317 seedlings/ha and only 13\% of them exhibit normal growth, others
   remain stunted for 5-20 yrs. With time, successive cohorts of stunted
   seedlings overcome growth check. Black spruce density was negatively
   associated with OM depth and Kalmia cover. The probability of growth
   release was associated negatively with OM depth and positively with soil
   respiration. We conclude that poor black spruce regeneration in Kalmia
   heath is largely due to safe site limitation controlled by OM depth,
   which also controls seedling stunting and growth release. The novelty of
   this work is the discovery of ontogenic patterns of conifer seedlings in
   nutrient stressed habitats. Our findings have implications for tree
   regeneration in other environmentally and nutritionally stressed
   ecosystems such as treelines.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire soil erosion is of considerable concern because of the
   potential decline in site productivity and adverse effects on downstream
   resources. For the Colorado Front Range there is a paucity of post-fire
   erosion data and a corresponding lack of predictive models. This study
   measured hillslope-scale sediment production rates and site
   characteristics for three wild and three prescribed fires over two
   summers and one winter using 48 sediment fences. Over 90\% of the
   sediment was generated by summer convective storms. Sediment production
   rates from recent, high-severity wildfires were 0.2-1.0 kg m(-2)
   year(-1). Mean sediment production rates from areas recently burned at
   moderate and low severity were only 0.02 and 0.005 kg m(-2) year(-1),
   respectively. For a given severity, sediment production rates from
   prescribed fires were generally lower than from wildfires, but there was
   considerable variability between plots and within fire severity classes.
   Fire severity, percent bare soil, rainfall erosivity, soil water
   repellency and soil texture explained 77\% of the variability in
   sediment production rates, while a two-parameter model using percentage
   bare soil and rainfall erosivity explained 62\% of the variability.
   Model validation confirmed the usefulness of these empirical models. The
   improved understanding of post-fire erosion rates can help guide forest
   management and post-fire rehabilitation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The post-fire regeneration of a 45-yr-old Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine)
   forest, burned in July 1989, has been studied on Mount Parnis, Attiki,
   Greece. Four experimental plots at various slopes and exposures were
   established at altitudes of 400-450 m, and monitored for 3 yr at 3-month
   intervals. Early regeneration took place abundantly, through both
   resprouting and seed germination of mostly hard-seeded herbs and shrubs;
   the floristic richness was high with 80 taxa, Pine seedling emergence
   took place during the winter of the first post-fire year. The mean pine
   seedling density by the end of the recruitment period (March 1990) was
   5-6 seedlings/m(2). This density decreased slightly during late spring
   and considerably during summer. During the second post-fire year only a
   relatively slight decline was observed; thereafter the density was
   stabilized to 1-2 seedlings/m(2). Mortality follows a negative
   exponential curve that levels off at ca. 20\%. Height distributions
   throughout the three post-fire years were all positively skewed as a
   result of the presence of few very tall saplings. A considerable
   fraction (20\%) of very short (5-15 cm) saplings were still alive 39
   months after the fire; these may constitute the sapling bank. Based on

Volume = {{217}},

Abstract = {{Members of the widespread arid Australian mulga (Acacia aneura) complex
   are fire-sensitive shrubs or small trees that can resprout epicormically
   following low-severity burning, but are readily killed by high-severity
   fire. The seeds of many species of mulga are stimulated to germinate by
   heat during burning, although post-fire regeneration rates are
   unpredictable. Here, we investigated whether variability in post-fire
   mulga recruitment relates to the relationship between fire severity and
   soil heating during fire, which may kill, leave unaffected, or stimulate
   the germination of buried seeds. This hypothesis was examined in central
   Australia on slender mulga (A. aptaneura), by experimentally
   investigating (a) seedling recruitment rates under different fire
   severity classes, (b) the germination and lethal temperature thresholds
   of seeds, (c) soil temperatures during fires of different severity
   classes and (d) the emergence depths of seedlings beneath high- and
   low-severity burnt plants. We found that post-fire recruitment was
   significantly lower beneath low-severity burnt and unburnt plants than
   high-severity burnt plants. This result was explained by the finding
   that maximum germinability of mulga seeds occurs after heating to
   between 80 and 100 A degrees C, and that these temperatures are not
   achieved in unburnt patches or low-severity burns at depths where the
   majority of the seed bank is known to occur. Despite the increased
   regeneration observed after high-severity fire, post-fire recruitment
   was highly variable between sites, independent of fire severity. This
   indicates that while heat-stimulated germination may confer on mulga a
   risk-spreading strategy to a range of fire severities, post-burn
   recruitment may not always offset high adult death rates following
   high-severity fire.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Accelerated vegetation changes are predicted for
   Southwestern forests due to changing disturbance regimes and climate.
   The 2001 Leroux Fire burned across a landscape with pre-existing
   permanent plots during one of the most extreme drought periods over the
   last few decades, providing a rare opportunity to assess
   wildfire-drought interactions. The wildfire burned with variable
   severity across a mountainous transition zone. We took advantage of this
   opportunity to re-measure plots originally established in 2000, and
   extend the temporal scale of response data to 15 years post-fire.
   Results: Although fire severity classification adequately described
   initial effects, tree mortality was indistinguishable among the burned
   plots between 2002 and 2016, ranging from 38 to 41\%. Our results
   indicated extensive secondary tree mortality that nearly equaled initial
   mortality in three of four fire severity classes. Mortality from 2002 to
   2016 varied by species, with quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.)
   experiencing disproportionately higher mortality (46 to 62\% tree loss)
   than other species across all fire severities. Ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa Engelm.) mortality (34\% tree loss) between 2002 and 2016 on
   unburned plots, along with similar mortality on moderate- and
   high-severity plots, show that even the most drought-tolerant species on
   our site was affected by exceptionally warm and dry conditions.
   Regeneration immediately post fire was dominated by aspen sprouts across
   all fire severities. By 2016, however, aspen densities were lower than
   pre-fire observations in unburned, moderate- and high-severity plots,
   and conifer seedlings primarily established in unburned plots. Ponderosa
   pine seedlings established between 2011 and 2016 and were observed in
   only one unburned plot in 2016. The lack of pine regeneration and the
   relatively small size of high-severity patches in the Leroux Fire
   suggest that factors other than seed dispersal limited ponderosa pine
   regeneration.
   Conclusions: Substantial mortality (68\% tree loss) and 39\% basal area
   reduction over the 15-year study, plus variable aspen regeneration and
   sparse conifer regeneration, led to non-forested conditions and isolated
   aspen stands. Although small in size, the Leroux Fire provided an
   example of continuing post-fire forest community changes driven by
   temperature increases and drought Thus, wildfire and climate change
   interactions may accelerate shifts in structure and composition in
   Southwest forest ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines post-fire erosion response in a sub-alpine
   environment in south-eastern Australia for a period of 2.2 years. Few
   studies have examined fire impacts on sediment transfer in this
   environment. Erosion pins were used in grids located at upper, mid and
   lower slope positions on adjacent burnt and unburnt hillslopes to assess
   fire effects on the extent of surface level change. The results
   indicated that there was a significant difference between the surface
   level change regimes on the burnt and unburnt hillslopes. Estimated
   erosion rates for the burnt slope over the study period ranged from 2.7
   to 94.3 t ha(-1), which could be considered low given the high slope
   angles, high precipitation and moderate fire severity. Slope position
   was critical in modifying post-fire erosion response, as it controlled
   slope angle and the rate of surface cover regrowth. Analysis of lower
   slope sites, for which more detailed data was available, indicated a
   second delayed erosion peak after the initial elevated post-fire
   response during the following spring snowmelt period. Surface recovery
   on the lower burnt site was slow, with vegetation cover still
   comparatively low 2.3 years after the fire. Evidence of post-fire
   sediment supply limitation was found on this site, with a declining rate
   of increase in the magnitude of total surface level change, despite
   limited regrowth and an increasing number of precipitation events >20 mm
   for measurement intervals since the fire. Modification of the hillslope
   surface by fire leads to changing hillslope erosion process dominance in
   this environment. The post-fire hillslope undergoes erosion by direct
   rain-drop impact and overland flow, whereas the unburnt slope rarely
   experiences overland flow due to the thick ground cover. As a result
   surface level change on the unburnt slope was largely influenced by
   wetting-drying effects rather than sediment transfer by surface flow.
   Downslope biotransfer appears to be the dominant sediment movement
   process in the unburnt sub-alpine forest environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {{WILDFIRES ALTER RODENT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ACROSS FOUR VEGETATION TYPES

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed burned and unburned plots across four habitat reserves in
   San Diego County, California, USA, in 2005 and 2006, to assess the
   effects of the 2003 wildfires on the community structure and relative
   abundance of rodent species. The reserves each contained multiple
   vegetation types (coastal sage scrub, chaparral, woodland, and
   grassland) and spanned from 250 m to 1078 m in elevation. Multivariate
   analyses revealed a more simplified rodent community structure in all
   burned habitats in comparison to unburned habitats. Reduction in shrub
   and tree cover was highly predictive of changes in post-fire rodent
   community structure in the burned coastal sage scrub and chaparral
   habitats. Reduction in cover was not predictive for the less
   substantially burned woodlands and grasslands, for which we hypothesized
   that interspecific competition played a greater role in post-fire
   community structure. Across vegetation types, generalists and open
   habitat specialists typically increased in relative abundance, whereas
   closed habitat specialists decreased. We documented significant
   increases in relative abundance of the deer mouse (Peromyscus
   maniculatus Wagner) and Dulzura kangaroo rat (Dipodomys simulans
   Merriam). In contrast, we found significant decreases in relative
   abundance for the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus Gambel), San
   Diego pocket mouse (Chaetodipus fallax Merriam), desert woodrat (Neotoma
   lepida Thomas), and brush mouse (Peromyscus boylii Baird). Currently,
   our research program involves assessment of whether habitat conservation
   plans (HCPs) in southern California provide long-term protection to HCP
   covered species, as well as preserve ecosystem function. The scenario of
   increased wildfires needs to be incorporated into this assessment. We
   discuss our results in relation to management and conservation planning
   under a future scenario of larger and more frequent wildfires in
   southern California.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{692}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, land-use changes have made Mediterranean forests
   highly susceptible to wildfires, which can cause several impacts not
   only on burnt areas, but also on adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Post-fire
   runoff from burnt areas may transport toxic substances to streams by
   surface runoff, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
   metals, which can be noxious to aquatic organisms. Impacts on aquatic
   ecosystems can be related to fire severity, forest type and the exposure
   period; however, these factors have not been investigated in tandem.
   Here, we used the stream detrital system to determine the impacts of
   post-fire runoffs and stream water from a burnt catchment on trophic
   interactions between stream microbial communities and invertebrate
   shredders involved in leaf litter decomposition. Three distinct types of
   samples were collected from a burnt catchment: post-fire runoffs from
   high severity wildfires in Pinus and Eucalyptus forests, and stream
   water. Microbial decomposer communities (fungi and bacteria) and the
   invertebrate shredder Allogamus ligonifer were exposed for 10 and 20
   days to increasing concentrations (0, 50, 75 and 100\%) of runoff
   extracts. Our results showed that post-tire runoffs from high severity
   wildfires reduced microbially-driven leaf litter decomposition (up to
   79\%), invertebrate feeding (up to 75\%), fungal biomass (up to 39\%)
   and altered community composition; effects were more severe at the
   longer exposure time. The impacts varied with the runoff source and were
   related to the chemical composition in metals and total PAHs. This study
   emphasizes the importance of assessing the indirect effects of wildfires
   taking into account the effects of the runoff source, load and exposure
   time on freshwater biota and their ecological functions. Therefore, best
   forest management practices should be applied to minimize post-fire
   runoffs reaching aquatic ecosystems and to reduce the effects of these
   extreme events on freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. (C)

Abstract = {{Fire regimes in temperate forests and woodlands have changed
   significantly in Australia since European settlement. We hypothesised
   that an absence of fire leads to the increased development of woody
   understorey/midstorey and that this may be correlated with decreased
   water and/or nutrient availability in overstorey temperate eucalypts
   currently declining in health. Sites with a history of being long
   unburnt or recently (and frequently in the case of Eucalyptus
   gomphocephala woodland) burnt (relative to median fire intervals for the
   vegetation type) were established in E. gomphocephala woodland in
   Western Australia and in Eucalyptus delegatensis forest in Tasmania. In
   long unburnt sites in both E. gomphocephala woodland and E. delegatensis
   forest, there was greater percent cover of understorey/midstorey and
   eucalypts had higher water use efficiency, indicative of greater soil
   water limitation, as estimated by foliar carbon isotope ratios. In E.
   gomphocephala woodland foliar Cu and Zn were significantly lower in
   eucalypts of long unburnt, relative to frequently burnt, sites. In E.
   gomphocephala woodland, understorey/midstorey (shrub) cover was
   positively correlated, and foliar copper and zinc levels were negatively
   correlated to health of overstorey trees. In E. delegatensis forest
   foliar phosphorus (P) was significantly lower in eucalypts of long
   unburnt, relative to recently burnt, sites. In E. delegatensis forest
   moss cover was positively correlated and foliar P was negatively
   correlated to health of overstorey trees. The understorey/midstorey that
   develops in the long absence of fire may alter ecological processes that
   lead to less favourable water- and nutrient-relations in E.
   gomphocephala woodland and E. delegatensis forest that are associated
   with decline in crown health. However this study does not definitively
   show a link between understorey/midstorey vegetation and overstorey tree

Abstract = {{Salvage logging is common practice in the boreal forest of northeastern
   Alberta, Canada. Fire-killed aspen snags are harvested as soon as is
   feasible after fire, and in the case of the House River fire (which
   burned over 250,000 ha in May and June 2002), planning and harvesting
   began before the fire was extinguished and continued until summer 2003.
   The ecological consequences of salvage logging are poorly understood,
   and unknown for bryophytes. Frequency of bryophyte occurrence was
   sampled during the first (2003) and second (2004) growing seasons after
   fire, in both burned and salvage logged stands. Because many bryophytes
   are substrate-specific, and because burned wood and scorched soil are
   important post-fire substrates, bryophytes in these microhabitats were
   targeted. Post-fire specialists and ubiquitous species dominated the
   communities on both substrates in burned stands and included Aulacomnium
   palustre, Ceratodon purpureus, Funaria hygrometrica, Leptobryum
   pyriforme, Marchantia polymorpha, Pohlia nutans, and Polytrichum
   juniperinum. Salvage logging had a greater negative affect on bryophytes
   on burned wood than those observed on scorched soil. On burned wood,
   species richness was lower and the community differed in salvage logged
   stands compared to burned stands; these observations were consistent
   over both years of study. On scorched soil, species richness was lower
   and community composition differed in salvage logged stands compared to
   burned stands in the first year after salvage logging, but these
   differences were overcome by the second year after salvage logging. To
   preserve bryophytes on a managed landbase, particularly those found on
   wood, management objectives should include provisions to protect
   bryophyte substrate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scattered trees are considered keystone structures' in many agricultural

   5.3\% in the control observation plots. The impact of wildfire was
   amplified (as revealed by greater percentage tree losses) by larger

Abstract = {{Following severe wildfires in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, dead
   trees remain on the landscape and eventually fall, but relatively little
   is known about the quantity and quality of post-wildfire coarse woody
   debris (CWD). To describe post-fire conditions, we measured snags, CWD,
   and fine woody debris and forest floor depth on seven fires in a
   chronosequence from 3 to 27 years old in northern Arizona. Snags
   declined in density with increasing time since fire and generally
   followed expected patterns of decay, except that few snags stood long
   enough to reach a clean-bark state. The mean biomass of the surface CWD
   ranged from as low of 3.3 Mg ha(-1) to a high of 41.3 Mg ha(-1). Total
   CWD biomass in the surface fuel load remained roughly comparable from
   8-9-year-old fires to a 27-year-old fire but the state of the CWD
   changed from sound to rotten. The change to a rotten condition suggests
   an increase in ignitability of the post-fire fuel load, but fine fuels
   that could support high fireline intensity were relatively low. The
   number of ``jackstraws,{''} points where intersecting downed logs could
   create a hot spot if reburned, was slightly higher in the oldest fire.
   Few fire-created snags remained by the 27th year post-fire. Management
   options to reduce fuels after severe wildfire, such as salvage logging,

Abstract = {{Forest managers require reliable tools to evaluate post-fire recovery
   across different geographic/climatic contexts and define management
   actions at the landscape scale, which might be highly resource-consuming
   in terms of data collection. In this sense, remote sensing techniques
   allow for gathering environmental data over large areas with low
   collection effort. We aim to assess the applicability of remote sensing
   tools in post-fire management within and across three mega-fires that
   occurred in pine fire-prone ecosystems located along an
   Atlantic-Transition-Mediterranean climatic gradient. Four years after
   the wildfires, we established 120 2x2m plots in each mega-fire site,
   where we evaluated: (1) density of pine seedlings, (2) percentage of
   woody species cover and (3) percentage of dead plant material cover.
   These variables were modeled following a Bayesian Model Averaging
   approach on the basis of spectral indices and texture features derived
   from WorldView-2 satellite imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. We
   assessed model interpolation and transferability within each mega-fire,
   as well as model extrapolation between mega-fires along the climatic
   gradient. Texture features were the predictors that contributed most in
   all cases. The woody species cover model had the best performance
   regarding spatial interpolation and transferability within the three
   study sites, with predictive errors lower than 25\% for the two
   approaches. Model extrapolation between the Transition and Mediterranean
   sites had low levels of error (from 6\% to 19\%) for the three field
   variables, because the landscape in these areas is similar in structure
   and function and, therefore, in spectral characteristics. However, model
   extrapolation from the Atlantic site achieved the weakest results (error
   higher than 30\%), due to the large ecological differences between this
   particular site and the others. This study demonstrates the potential of
   fine-grained satellite imagery for land managers to conduct post-fire
   recovery studies with a high degree of generality across different
   geographic/climatic contexts.}},

Abstract = {{In burned forestlands, fire scar wounds commonly occur on tree stems as
   a result of cambial heating. In hardwood forests in particular, wounding
   can lead to stem decay with the extent of decay being related to scar
   size and exposure time. Therefore, wound closure rates are important to
   understand in the context of fire management such that allowing
   sufficient time for wound closure to occur between fires would enhance
   wood quality. Conversely, in the context of wildlife management,
   understanding wound closure rates would improve fire prescriptions
   needed for creating basal tree cavities as keeping wounds open prior to
   wound closure could enhance cavity development. The objectives of this
   study were to quantify growth and wound closure rates of white oaks
   ((Nereus alba), one of the most valuable tree species in the central
   U.S. to both commercial forestry and wildlife. From historically burned,
   mature, oak-hickory forest site in Missouri, we sampled a wide range of
   tree sizes, fire scar sizes, and fire scar ages to determine the
   environmental and tree factors related to closure rates.
   Dendrochronological techniques were paired with new approaches of
   digitizing tree rings to capture malformed woundwood areas. The time
   required for wound closure ranged from 1 to 24 years and was
   significantly correlated to scar size. Surprisingly, post-fire growth
   trends were positive following scarring. Growth was positively related
   to scar and tree size. With this information, we expect that the process
   of basal wound closure and tree growth can be considered in a
   quantitative framework and used to guide fire management for wood
   quality or wildlife tree cavities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{582-586}},
Abstract = {{Aim of study: The main aim of this study was to analyse the post-fire
   recruitment and growth of Pinus pinaster seedlings during the first five
   years after wildfire and also to analyse the effects of climatic
   conditions on the survival of P. pinaster seedlings
   Area of study: The study area was located in a P. pinaster stand in Leon
   province (NW Spain) burned in 1998.
   Material and methods: Three sites in the burned area were selected. In
   each site three permanent transects of 20 m x 1 m were placed. In each
   transect, twenty 1 m(2) sampling units were marked and the number and
   height of each pine seedlings was recorded at 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 months
   and 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after the wildfire. The soil of study area is
   Cambisol.
   Mean results: Mean Pinus regeneration densities varied between 33.2
   seedlings/m(2) after 7 months and 6 seedlings/m(2) five years after
   wildfire. In this P. pinaster stand, maximum mortality appeared during
   the summer months in the first year of regeneration. There was a
   significant increase in seedling height associated with a decrease in
   density.
   Research highlights: The post-fire recruitment is considered enough to
   ensure good natural Pinus pinaster forest regeneration. In the short
   term post-fire management strategy in this type of forest could be the
   remaining branches with cones of burned trees that allow the
   dissemination of the seeds during the first few years after fire and
   ensure natural regeneration.}},

   oaks (Quercus chapmanii and Q. geminata) and two red oaks (Q. laevis and
   Q. myrtifolia) were conducted annually (except in 1991) on two 2.7-ha
   grids from 1969 to 1998. A prescribed burn was conducted on one of the
   grids in May 1993 Newly sprouted ramets of both white oaks produced
   acorns during the first year following the fire, whereas red oaks
   required 3 yr (Q. myrtifolia) or 4 yr (Q. laevis) to produce acorns. The
   difference in the timing of post-fire acorn production between the white
   and red oak species reflected the difference in the number of years from
   flower bud initiation to mature acorns in the two groups, with the
   additional year-long lag in Q. laevis probably attributable to the fact
   that it is typically a tree rather than a shrub species. The data
   suggested that percentage of bearing ramets in the smallest size class
   of the two white oak species was markedly lower in the burned than
   unburned grid in the first year of post-fire acorn production and higher
   in the fifth year, but these trends were not evident for the red oaks.
   Among all four species, differences between mean number of acorns in
   burned and unburned grids were significant in only two cases (the
   largest size class of both white oak species in the fifth year). There
   was no evidence of recruitment from acorns on the burned grid, possibly
   due to the rapid redevelopment of the shrub layer because of low
   mortality of the extensive clonal root systems. Rapid post-fire recovery
   of acorn production in xeric fire-prone habitats is presumably the
   result of selection to increase the probability of recovery and
   persistence following sufficiently intense fires that result in high oak
   mortality. The timing and magnitude of post-fire acorn production in
   sandhill and other xeric Florida associations has a potential impact on
   a wide variety of insects, birds, and mammals that feed on acorns, as
   well as on the species with which they interact.}},

   factors affecting the abundance of two fire-associated carabid species
   (Sericoda quadripuntata and S. bembidioides) we conducted three field
   studies based on pitfall trapping in recent bums in Alberta, Canada. The
   results suggest that the abundance of both species drastically decreased
   from the first to the third post-fire year and that fire severity was
   positively associated with abundance of both species. The combined
   effects of wildfire and forest harvesting were associated with higher
   catches of S. quadripunctata, but lower catches of S. bembidioides. We
   discuss these findings in the contexts of salvage logging and species

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) and
   holin oak (Quercus ilex L.) are climatozonal species in the area of
   Zadar where the communities formed by these two species have an
   ecological-protective role. The aim of this research is to address the
   problem of the disturbed stability of these stands and the possibility
   of their post-fire regeneration.
   Materials and Methods: Research was undertaken in burned and unburned
   areas of the Zadar Forest Office. This included pubescent oak coppices
   scrub, thickets, maquis and garrigue. The releves were made according to
   the plant sociology method (Braun-Blanquet 1964, Dierschke 1994).
   Pedological research involved talking compostie samples of the
   humus-accumulative horizon. Chemical soil analyses were performed
   according to the standard methods.
   Results: The number of pubescent oak individuals Was about 2 times
   higher in burned areas compared to unburned ones. This was in contrast
   to holin oak, which showed poorer occurrence in burned areas in relation
   to unburned ones. The average number of all trees and shrubs in degraded
   forms of pubescent oak was 11.567 per hectare, whereas in degraded forms
   of holm oak forest this number was more than twice as high and amounted
   to 2.550 individuals per hectare.
   Conclusions: Forest fires are an important cause of soil degradation.
   Burned areas are subject to erosion, the disappearance of or a decrease
   in sod biological activity, and extreme ecological effects. In order to
   mitigate the problem, certain prescribed post-fire recovery methods
   should be urgently applied.}},

Abstract = {{Background Concern is mounting that larger, stand-replacing forest fires
   may accelerate compositional shifts or conversions to non-forested
   states under a warming climate. Post-fire climatic conditions influence
   system trajectories by facilitating or hindering juvenile recruitment.
   But without an accurate, long-term understanding of where, when, and how
   climatic variability and other ecological factors affect regeneration,
   our ability to predict post-fire trajectories is limited. I quantified
   multiple, interacting facets of post-fire conifer regeneration-including
   annual establishment rates and growth-one decade after stand-replacing
   fire on the eastern slopes of the North Cascades, Washington, USA. Sites
   were stratified across topographic settings to specifically capture the
   potential for topography to moderate seasonal and interannual climatic
   conditions. Results Recruitment of juvenile conifers occurred every year
   since fire, with considerable species-specific variability across
   topographic settings and distance to seed source. Juveniles of all
   species, except lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex
   S. Watson), were rarely observed when live, conspecific seed source was
   more than 75 m away. Lodgepole pine was the only species for which
   greater distance to live seed source was not associated with lower
   densities, a pattern attributable to serotiny. Annual establishment
   rates were strongly correlated with post-fire conditions: rates were
   highest when growing seasons were relatively cool and moist. A lagged
   climate signal was apparent in annual growth rates, but standardized
   climate-growth relationships did not vary across topographic settings,
   suggesting that topographic setting did not decouple site conditions
   from broader climatic trends to a degree that affected growth patterns.
   Conclusions These results underscore the importance of favorable
   post-fire climatic conditions in promoting robust establishment and
   growth while also highlighting the importance of topography and
   endogenous, stand-level processes (e.g., seed availability and delivery)
   in shaping recovery over time. Furthermore, these results suggest that,
   while the growing concern of post-fire regeneration failure may indeed
   be warranted under some conditions, failure is not yet the rule in all
   places and at all times. A more detailed understanding of recovery
   dynamics through long-term monitoring and by examining multiple,
   interacting facets of regeneration across scales will improve our
   predictions of where and when regeneration failure or, conversely,
   robust recovery may occur under a changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) stored in vegetation and soils is known to be released to
   the atmosphere during wildfires, increasing atmospheric stores and
   altering terrestrial budgets. Increased erosion and transport of
   sediments is well-documented in burned watersheds, both immediately
   post-fire and as the watershed recovers; however, understanding
   post-fire mobilization of soil Hg within burned watersheds remains
   elusive. The goal of the current study is to better understand the
   impact of wildfire on soil-bound Hg during the immediate post-fire
   period as well as during recovery, in order to assess the potential for
   sediment-driven transport to and within surface waters in burned
   watersheds. Soils were collected from three southern California
   watersheds of similar vegetation and soil characteristics that
   experienced wildfire. Sampling in one of these watersheds was extended
   for several seasons (1.5 years) in order to investigate temporal changes
   in soil Hg concentrations. Laboratory analysis included bulk soil total
   Hg concentrations and total organic carbon of burned and unburned
   samples. Soils were also fractionated into a subset of grain sizes with
   analysis of Hg on each fraction. Low Hg concentrations were observed in
   surface soils immediately post-fire. Accumulation of Hg coincident with
   moderate vegetative recovery was observed in the burned surface soils 1
   year following the fire, and mobilization was also noted during the
   second winter (rainy) season. Hg concentrations were highest in the
   fine-grained fraction of unburned soils; however, in the burned soils,
   the distribution of soil-bound Hg was less influenced by grain size. The
   accelerated accumulation of Hg observed in the burned soils, along with
   the elevated risk of erosion, could result in increased delivery of
   organic- or particulate-bound Hg to surface waters in post-fire systems.}},

Abstract = {{Stand structure and fuel mass were measured before and after a post-fire
   logging operation conducted 2 years after the 1996 Summit Wildfire
   (Malheur National Forest), in a ponderosa pine-dominated forest in
   northeastern Oregon. Variables were measured both pre- and post-logging
   in four replicate units for each of three treatments {[}un-logged
   control, commercial harvest (most dead merchantable trees removed), fuel
   reduction harvest (most dead merchantable trees removed plus most dead
   trees > 10 cm diameter)]. Post-fire logging resulted in a significant
   decrease in mean basal area, down to 46\% pre-treatment level in
   commercial units, and down to 25\% in fuel reduction units. Logging
   significantly reduced tree density, especially for the smallest (< 22 cm
   diameter) and intermediate (23-41 cm) diameter classes. Fuel reduction
   units also had significantly fewer snags (dead trees > 30 cm diameter-4
   ha(-1)), compared to both commercial (23 ha(-1)) units and to un-logged
   controls (64 ha(-1)) in the year following timber harvest. Logging did
   not change ladder height or tree species composition (\% ponderosa pine,
   Douglas-fir and grand fir). Total woody fuel mass increased
   significantly in fuel reduction units when compared to controls, with
   the greatest difference among treatments occurring in the slash fuel (<
   7.6 cm diameter) component (mean of 6.2 Mg/ha for fuel reduction stands
   versus 1.3 Mg/ha for un-logged stands). Logging activity caused no
   change in the mass of the forest floor (litter or duff). Model
   projections of the fuel bed using the fire and fuels extension of the
   forest vegetation simulator (FVS-FFE) indicate that the disparity in
   slash fuel mass between fuel reduction and un-logged units would be
   sustained until about 15 years post-logging, but a re-burn of moderate
   intensity occurring during this time would likely kill all young trees,
   even in un-logged units, because of the influence of other components of
   the fuel bed, such as grasses and shrubs. Model projections of 1000-h
   fuels (woody fuels > 7.6 cm diameter) indicate that standing structure
   in all stands would collapse quickly, with the result that un-logged
   stands would contain two- or three-fold greater masses at 25 and 50
   years post-logging, leading to much higher consumption rates of fuel in
   the event of a re-burn in the same place. Variation in dead tree fall
   and decay rates did not change the relationship among treatments in
   1000-h fuel loads, but changed the time at which treatment differences
   were projected to disappear. Despite treatment differences in heavy fuel
   accumulations over time however, FVS-FFE predicts no differences among
   treatments in mortality of young trees due to either moderate or high
   intensity fire occurring in the same place at 25, 50, or 100 years
   post-fire logging. The lack of a re-burn effect is in part due to the
   reliance on flame length as the primary mechanism leading to tree death
   in the fire effect models used by FVS-FFE. If tree death turns out to be
   caused more by root burning or cambial heating, the observed variations
   in 1000-h fuel loadings among treatments could be significant in the
   event of a future re-burn. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic fire is widely hypothesized to limit woody plant encroachment
   in semiarid grasslands. In southern Texas, however, most of the woody
   plants that have invaded grasslands during the past two centuries are
   resistant to fire. We hypothesized that browsing by Odocoileus
   virginianus increases mortality of palatable shrubs and reduces vigor of
   shrubs following fire. We randomly selected ten pairs of each of three
   shrub species - Condalia hookeri, Acacia farnesiana, and Celtis
   ehrenbergiana - in each of three locations before prescribed burns
   during summer 2001. Following burns, we used a wire fence to protect one
   shrub of each pair from browsing. We estimated intensity of O.
   virginianus browsing and number and height of sprouts 4, 12, 20, 30, 38,
   and 47 weeks post-fire. We determined shrub height, survival, and
   biomass one year post-fire. Averaged across species, browsing intensity
   on unfenced shrubs was greater (LS Means, P < 0.05) than on fenced
   shrubs on all sampling dates except four and 30 weeks post-fire.
   Mortality of unfenced (11 +/- 9\%) (mean +/- SE) and fenced (12 +/- 7\%,

   height, and biomass of protected and browsed plants were similar (P >

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic (or human-caused) wildfire is an increasingly important
   driver of ecological change on Pacific islands including southeastern
   Polynesia, but fire ecology studies are almost completely absent for
   this region. Where observations do exist, they mostly represent
   descriptions of fire effects on plant communities before the
   introduction of invasive species in the modern era. Understanding the
   effects of wildfire in southeastern Polynesian island vegetation
   communities can elucidate which species may become problematic invasives
   with continued wildfire activity. We investigate the effects of wildfire
   on vegetation in three low-elevation sites (45-379 m) on the island of
   Mo'orea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, which are already
   heavily impacted by past human land use and invasive exotic plants, but
   retain some native flora. In six study areas (three burned and three
   unburned comparisons), we placed 30 transects across sites and collected
   species and abundance information at 390 points. We analyzed each local
   community of plants in three categories: natives, those introduced by
   Polynesians before European contact (1767 C.E.), and those introduced
   since European contact. Burned areas had the same or lower mean species
   richness than paired comparison sites. Although wildfire did not affect
   the proportions of native and introduced species, it may increase the
   abundance of introduced species on some sites. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling indicates that (not recently modified)
   comparison plant communities are more distinct from one another than are

Abstract = {{For aerial seedbank species, the seed abscission schedule following fire
   is of practical interest as it affects the optimal timing of post-fire
   salvage operations designed to maximize natural regeneration. It is also
   of theoretical interest as we would expect that the rapid deterioration
   of the better (very thin duff or exposed mineral soil) post-fire
   seedbeds due to leaf-fall from regenerating plants ought to select for
   rapid dissemination of seeds following burning. Nonetheless, there are
   no published reports of the abscission schedule of an aerial seedbank
   species that include the full temporal range from the fire date to
   several years after. In northwestern Quebec, we used eight burnt,
   non-salvaged stands, four dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) and
   four dominated by jack pine (Pinus banksiana), in three different fires
   to examine the seed abscission schedule of these aerial seedbank species
   for the first 3 years after fire. We found that (1) the abscission
   schedules of populations of each species differed between fires and (2)
   black spruce dispersed seeds from the cones at a significantly slower
   rate than jack pine at all fires. Extrapolating from the regressions
   (all fires lumped), we conclude that approximately 90\% of jack pine and
   black spruce seeds will have been dispersed by 1 and 5 years,
   respectively, after a fire. Further, we argue that due to its protracted
   abscission schedule, early post-fire salvage will invariably require
   that black spruce be planted. The approach adopted here should be useful
   for optimizing post-fire salvage timing for all commercially valuable
   species with aerial seedbanks. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Post-fire runoff has the potential to be a large source of contaminants
   to downstream areas. However, the magnitude of this effect in urban
   fringe watersheds adjacent to large sources of airborne contaminants is
   not well documented. The current study investigates the impacts of
   wildfire on stormwater contaminant loading from the upper Arroyo Seco
   watershed, burned in 2009. This watershed is adjacent to the Greater Los
   Angeles, CA, USA area and has not burned in over 60 years. Consequently,
   it acts as a sink for regional urban pollutants and presents an
   opportunity to study the impacts of wildfire. Pre- and post-fire storm
   samples were collected and analyzed for basic cations, trace metals, and
   total suspended solids. The loss of vegetation and changes in soil
   properties from the fire greatly increased the magnitude of storm
   runoff, resulting in sediment-laden floods carrying high concentrations
   of particulate-bound constituents. Post-fire concentrations and loads
   were up to three orders of magnitude greater than pre-fire values for
   many trace metals, including lead and cadmium. A shift was also observed
   in the timing of chemical delivery, where maximum suspended sediment,
   trace metal, and cation concentrations coincided with, rather than
   preceded, peak discharge in the post-fire runoff, amplifying the fire's
   impacts on mass loading. The results emphasize the importance of
   sediment delivery as a primary mechanism for post-fire contaminant
   transport and suggest that traditional management practices that focus
   on treating only the early portion of storm runoff may be less effective
   following wildfire. We also advocate that watersheds impacted by
   regional urban pollutants have the potential to pose significant risk
   for downstream communities and ecosystems after fire.}},

   effects on functional diversity (FD) have been studied largely in single
   post-disturbance communities, but rarely applied to alternate
   successional pathways. Do post-fire Kalmia heaths have lower FD than
   forest communities, and does heath formation select for a narrow range
   of traits leading to biotic homogenization? Location Terra Nova National
   Park, Newfoundland, Canada. Methods Based on five functional traits
   (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, seed mass, height,
   specific root length), we measured functional trait dispersion within
   (alpha FD) and between sites (beta FD). We calculated overall FD metrics
   in nine heath and four forest sites as well as metrics for three
   functional groups (trees, shrubs, and herbs) in each site. We also
   performed a complementary taxonomic diversity (TD) analysis to establish
   links between FD and TD. Results We could not detect a difference in
   overall alpha TD between the two successional communities but found
   significant loss of alpha and beta FD in heaths and within tree and herb
   groups. Overall beta FD was lower in heaths than forests. It was also
   lower for trees and herbs, indicating an increase in functional
   similarity (functional homogenization) of the majority of life forms.
   Conclusions Between the two successional pathways, trait space occupancy
   was lower in heaths than forests. Heath formation in post-fire
   communities consistently restricts functional dispersion (low alpha FD)
   of tree and herb traits leading to functional homogenization (low beta
   FD). When a successional trajectory leads to heath formation, it is
   accompanied by a loss of functional diversity.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Fire frequency has decreased in many shrub-steppe communities.
   Re-introducing fire may be needed to increase spatial and temporal
   variability in vegetation, but is often hindered by concerns of
   undesired vegetation shifts. These concerns arise, in part, because
   long-term effects of fire re-introduction in these communities after
   prolonged fire exclusion and other departures from historical conditions
   are unknown. To better understand the effects of re-introducing fire, we
   evaluated plant community response to re-introducing fire for 12 years
   post fire in six mountain big sagebrush communities. Herbaceous biomass
   production was 1.7-fold greater in burned compared with unburned areas
   at the conclusion of the study. Exotic annual grasses appeared to be
   problematic in the first 8 years post fire, but became inconsequential
   (\~{}1\% cover) by the end of the study. Re-introducing fire promoted
   other shrubs (excluding sagebrush) that were probably inhibited by
   competition from sagebrush. Sagebrush cover and density remained low in
   burned areas for the duration of the study, because of limited
   recruitment in the years immediately post fire and competition from
   herbaceous vegetation. Re-introducing fire appears to increase temporal
   and spatial heterogeneity in shrub-steppe communities experiencing
   prolonged fire exclusion and, therefore, may be needed to maintain a
   diversity of plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire
   specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in
   recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source
   habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to
   evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed
   woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central
   Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally
   and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential
   source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time.
   Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined
   significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success
   declined from 84\% the first year after fire to 73\% and 25\%,
   respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density
   and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of
   burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests.
   Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests.
   Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates
   indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats
   for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a
   function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire
   forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone
   ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature
   and overmature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats
   important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated

Abstract = {{Fire is a major disturbance event that affects biomes worldwide,
   altering vegetation structure and flora and fauna assemblages. Here, we
   investigated the effects of an extensive wildfire (similar to 6240ha) on
   small mammal assemblages in savanna woodland (cerradAo) at two spatial
   scales (meso- and macrohabitat) in a neotropical savanna (Brazilian
   Cerrado). At each spatial scale, we assessed relationships between
   habitat structure and small mammal species composition and abundance
   before and after the fire in four natural patches (one burned, three
   unburned) using partial redundancy analysis. From July 2009 to October
   2013, we captured 1319 individuals belonging to 14 species. Our results
   showed that the fire had consequences for small mammal assemblage at
   both scales. After the fire, the burned patch differed from the other
   patches in vegetation attributes and species composition. At a fine
   scale, fire increased the herbaceous layer and decreased the litter
   layer and understory obstruction. On a larger scale, the main
   consequences of fire on vegetation structure were increased variation in
   litter depth, tree diameter, and distance to the nearest tree. We
   observed a relationship between mesohabitat structure and the abundance
   of species with different habitat requirements during the post-fire
   succession. Fire favored the invasion of generalist species from open
   Cerrado habitats (rodents Calomys tener, Calomys expulsus, Cerradomys
   scotti, and Necromys lasiurus) at the expense of more specialized forest
   species. Our results reinforce the relevance of incorporating
   multi-scale habitat heterogeneity in future studies assessing the

Pages = {{29-35}},
Abstract = {{Offspring recruitment is an important part of population dynamics, as
   well as for plant-community structure and succession. One generality
   regarding grasses and fire is that clonal grasses tolerate fire
   extremely well and in most cases reach their maximum production in the

   post-fire offspring, recruitment mode is very important. However,
   respective data are scare in the semiarid perennial steppe. We studied
   the relative importance of asexual v. sexual recruitment in the
   post-fire recovery in semiarid steppe on the Loess Plateau of
   northwestern China. We observed differences in regeneration strategy
   after different times post-fire (burnt in 2008, burnt in 1999, and
   nofire history for at least 30 years). Results showed that fire
   significantly increased offspring recruitment numbers, but not species
   richness. The increase of asexual recruitment after a fire made a major
   contribution to the increase of total offspring number. Meanwhile, there
   was no significant difference for the ratio of asexual to sexual
   recruitment among sites with different times since fire. The asexual to
   sexual recruitment ratio was significantly different for different
   species, with some species not recruiting offspring via sexual
   recruitment. Our results indicated that seedling recruitment contributed
   little to post-fire recovery of the perennial-steppe community. Lack of

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{6-7}},
Pages = {{511-517}},
Abstract = {{The montane area of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area was
   recently burnt by large fires ignited by lightning, and such fires are
   predicted to become more frequent with climate change. The region has a
   mix of fire-sensitive and fire-tolerant vegetation, but there is little
   information available on resprouting ability of seedlings of the
   dominant species of these mosaics. We predicted that seedlings of
   species found in fire-prone locations would exhibit more post-fire
   resprouting than seedlings of Gondwanan relictual species, which
   typically occur in fire-protected locations. To test this hypothesis we
   compared topkill and resprouting ability of seedlings from five tree
   species characteristic of the montane vegetation mosaics by exposing
   them to a propane burner flame for 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60s, simulating a
   fire intensity of 33 kW m(-1). Overall, 93 of 100 flame-exposed plants
   were topkilled. Topkill was related to duration of flame exposure and
   seedling size rather than species. By contrast, resprouting of topkilled
   seedlings was strongly correlated with species rather than seedling
   size, and was not affected by duration of flame exposure. Contrary to
   expectations, the rainforest plant Nothofagus cunninghamii was the
   strongest resprouter, whereas few of the topkilled eucalypt seedlings
   resprouted. Our study shows the commonly held association between
   palaeoendemic Gondwanan species and low fire tolerance versus Australian

Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{269-307}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire can lead to considerable hydrological and geomorphological
   change, both directly by weathering bedrock surfaces and changing soil
   structure and properties, and indirectly through the effects of changes
   to the soil and vegetation on hydrological and geomorphological
   processes. This review summarizes current knowledge and identifies
   research gaps focusing particularly on the contribution of research from
   the Mediterranean Basin, Australia and South Africa over the last two
   decades or so to the state of knowledge mostly built on research carried
   out in the USA.
   Wildfire-induced weathering rates have been reported to be high relative
   to other weathering processes in fire-prone terrain, possibly as much as
   one or two magnitudes higher than frost action, with important
   implications for cosmogenic-isotope dating of the length of rock
   exposure. Wildfire impacts on soil properties have been a major focus of
   interest over the last two decades. Fire usually reduces soil aggregate
   stability and can induce, enhance or destroy soil water repellency
   depending on the temperature reached and its duration. These changes
   have implications for infiltration, overland flow and rainsplash
   detachment. A large proportion of publications concerned with fire
   impacts have focused on post-fire soil erosion by water, particularly at
   small scales. These have shown elevated, sometimes extremely large
   post-fire losses before geomorphological stability is re-established.
   Soil losses per unit area are generally negatively related to
   measurement scale reflecting increased opportunities for sediment
   storage at larger scales. Over the last 20 years, there has been much
   improvement in the understanding of the forms, causes and timing of
   debris flow and landslide activity on burnt terrain. Advances in
   previously largely unreported processes (e..g. bio-transfer of sediment
   and wind erosion) have also been made.
   Post-fire hydrological effects have generally also been studied at small
   rather than large scales, with soil water repellency effects on
   infiltration and overland flow being a particular focus. At catchment
   scales, post-fire accentuated peakflow has received more attention than
   changes in total flow, reflecting easier measurement and the greater
   hazard posed by the former. Post-fire changes to stream channels occur
   over both short and long terms with complex feedback mechanisms, though
   research to date has been limited.
   Research gaps identified include the need to: (1) develop a fire
   severity index relevant to soil changes rather than to degree of biomass
   destruction; (2) isolate the hydrological and geomorphological impacts
   of fire-induced soil water repellency changes from other important
   post-fire changes (e.g. litter and vegetation destruction); (3) improve
   knowledge of the hydrological and geomorphological impacts of wildfire
   in a wider range of fire-prone terrain types; (4) solve important
   problems in the determination and analysis of hillslope and catchment
   sediment yields including poor knowledge about soil losses other than at
   small spatial and short temporal scales, the lack of a clear measure of
   the degradational significance of post-fire soil losses, and confusion
   arising from errors in and lack of scale context for many quoted
   post-fire soil erosion rates; and (5) increase the research effort into
   past and potential future hydrological and geomorphological changes
   resulting from wildfire. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionIn a seeder-dominated shrubland, does burning season affect

   LocationLos Puntales, Sierra Morena (Cordoba, southern Spain).
   MethodsThe shrubland was 12yr old, dominated by several species of
   Cistus, among the main seeders. Four blocks, each containing plots of
   25x25m, were burned in late May (early season, ES) and late September
   (late season, LS) with similar fire intensity. Woody plant density and
   woody and herbaceous cover and richness were monitored during the first
   three post-fire years and compared to pre-fire using ANOVA and
   ordination techniques.
   ResultsBurning season did not affect cover of the herbaceous or woody
   species in general, nor cover of the main groups (monocots, dicots,
   annuals and perennials) or density of the main woody species 3yr after
   fire. Fire, however, differentially affected the relative abundance of
   the main shrub species. Ordination analysis showed that, while
   succession of herbaceous species was on track to convergence with the
   pre-fire vegetation, this was not the case for the woody species.
   ConclusionsBurning season was not a significant factor in altering the
   post-fire regeneration in this seeder-dominated shrubland. Thus, the
   temporal window for prescribed fires is large, and both seasons could
   equally be used for management purposes. However, changes in the
   relative dominance of species due to fire indicate that managers should

Abstract = {{Widespread invasion of riparian ecosystems by the large bamboo-like

   ha of riparian woodlands along the Santa Clara River in southern
   California in October 2003. Post-fire A. donax growth rates and
   productivity were compared to those of native woody riparian species in
   plots established before and after the fire. Arundo donax resprouted
   within days after the fire and exhibited higher growth rates and
   productivity compared to native riparian plants. Arundo donax grew 3-4
   times faster than native woody riparian plants-up to a mean of 2.62 cm
   day(-1)-and reached up to 2.3 m in height less than 3 months after the
   fire. One year post-fire, A. donax density was nearly 20 times higher

   Three mechanisms-fire-adapted phenology, high growth rate, and growth
   response to nutrient enrichment-appear to promote the preemption of
   native woody riparian species by A. donax after fire. This greater
   dominance of A. donax after wildfire increased the susceptibility of
   riparian woodlands along the Santa Clara River to subsequent fire,
   potentially creating an invasive plant-fire regime cycle. Moreover, A.
   donax infestations appear to have allowed the wildfire to cross the
   broad bed of the Santa Clara River from the north, allowing thousands of
   acres of shrubland to the south to burn.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   Fire affects the structure and dynamics of ecosystems world-wide, over
   long time periods (decades and centuries) and at large spatial scales
   (landscapes and regions). A pressing challenge for ecologists is to
   develop models that explain and predict faunal responses to fire at
   broad temporal and spatial scales. We used a 105-year post-fire
   chronosequence to investigate small mammal responses to fire across an
   extensive area of `tree mallee' (i.e. vegetation characterized by small
   multi-stemmed eucalypts).
   Location
   The Murray Mallee region (104,000 km superset of) of semi-arid
   Australia.
   Methods
   First, we surveyed small mammals at 260 sites and explored the fire
   responses of four species using nonlinear regression models. Second, we
   assessed the predictive accuracy of models using cross-validation and by
   testing with independent data. Third, we examined our results in
   relation to an influential model of animal succession, the habitat
   accommodation model.
   Results
   Two of four study species showed a clear response to fire history. The
   distribution of the Mallee Ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, a carnivorous
   marsupial, was strongly associated with mature vegetation characterized
   by its cover of hummock grass. The occurrence of breeding females was
   predicted to increase up to 40-105 years post-fire, highlighting the
   extensive time periods over which small mammal populations may be
   affected by fire. Evaluation of models for N. yvonneae demonstrated that
   accurate predictions of species occurrence can be made from fire history
   and vegetation data, across large geographical areas. The introduced
   House Mouse Mus domesticus was the only species positively associated
   with recently burnt vegetation.
   Main conclusions
   Understanding the impact of fire over long time periods will benefit
   ecological and conservation management. In this example, tracts of
   long-unburnt mallee vegetation were identified as important habitat for
   a fire-sensitive native mammal. Small mammal responses to fire can be
   predicted accurately at broad spatial scales; however, a conceptual
   model of post-fire change in community structure developed in temperate
   Australia is not, on its own, sufficient for small mammals in semi-arid
   systems.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},

Abstract = {{The rationale for seeding following high-severity wildfires is to
   enhance plant cover and reduce bare ground, thus decreasing the
   potential for soil erosion and non-native plant invasion. However,
   experimental tests of the effectiveness of seeding in meeting these
   objectives in forests are lacking. We conducted three experimental
   studies of the effectiveness of seeding with non-native and native
   species following three Arizona wildfires. Seeding treatments were
   largely ineffective in increasing vegetative cover or decreasing exposed
   bare ground. At one treatment at one fire, wheat seeding at the Warm
   Fire, senesced seeded annuals increased litter cover and resulted in
   lower bare ground values than unseeded controls. Only on one fire, the
   Warm Fire, did seeded non-native annuals establish well, resulting in
   20-29\% vegetative cover. On the other two fires, seeded cereal grains
   accounted for <3\% cover. At all fires, native seeded species
   contributed between <1 and similar to 12\% vegetative cover. Vegetative
   cover on all treatments, including unseeded treatments, was at or near
   40\% the first year following fire, at all three study sites. Non-native
   species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments at any
   fire. This study adds to growing evidence that post-fire seeding is
   ineffective in enhancing post-fire plant cover and reducing invasive
   non-native plants.}},

Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{398-403}},
Abstract = {{Burned trees in the boreal forest are quickly colonized by wood-feeding
   beetles after fire. Roundheaded and flatheaded borers (Coleoptera:
   Cerambycidae, Buprestidae) are common wood-feeding beetles whose larvae
   feed on the phloem in the first instars before entering the xylem, where
   they excavate galleries several centimetres deep. These organisms cause
   significant damage to post-fire salvaged wood. Recent studies show that
   a variety of environmental factors may create heterogeneous patterns of
   damage throughout burned landscapes. We evaluated the relationship
   between fire intensity (measured as bole scorch height), tree size,
   elevation, and the landscape-scale distribution of beetle damage in
   black spruce in four 2-y-old fires in the central boreal forest of
   northern Quebec. Beetle damage significantly increased with char height
   and elevation but not with distance from unburned edge. With regard to
   tree diameter, the number of entry holes increased with fire intensity
   for large trees, whereas it declined with intensity for small trees. The
   most remarkable result was that while a very large sample size enabled
   us to detect these significant patterns, the difference in predicted
   beetle attack rates across a wide range of parameter values was quite
   muted. Thus, managers cannot use these results to dramatically improve
   either the way in which they salvage or the strategy for set-asides
   intended to benefit beetles and their subsequent avian predators.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forests of Russia play a prominent role in the global carbon
   cycle and the flux of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Large areas of
   Russian forest burn annually, and contributions to the net flux of
   carbon to the atmosphere may be significant. Forest fire emissions were
   calculated for the years 1971-1991 using fire frequency and distribution
   data and fuel and carbon density for different forest ecoregions of
   Russia. Both direct carbon release and indirect post-fire biogenic
   carbon flux were estimated. From 1971 to 1991 the annual total forest
   area burned by wildfire ranged from 1.41 X 10(6) to 10.0 X 10(6) ha.
   Approximately 15 000 - 25 000 forest fires occurred annually during this
   period. Mean annual direct CO2-C emissions from wildfire was
   approximately 0.05 Pg over this 21 -year period. Total post-fire
   biogenic CO2-C emissions for 1971-1991 ranged from 2.5 to 5.9 Pg
   (0.12-0.28 Pg annually). Forest fires and other disturbances are
   expected to be a primary mechanism driving vegetation change associated
   with projected global climate change. Future forest fire scenarios in
   Russia based on general circulation model projections suggest that up to
   30-50\% of the land surface area, or 334 x 10(6) to 631 x 10(6) ha of
   forest, will be affected. An additional 6.7 x 10(6) to 12.6 x 10(6) ha
   of Russian boreal forest are projected to burn annually if general
   circulation model based vegetation-change scenarios are achieved within
   the next 50 years. The direct flux Of CO2-C from future forest fires is
   estimated to total 6.1-10.7 Pg over a 50-year period. Indirect post-fire
   biogenic release of greenhouse gases in the future is expected to be two
   to six times greater than direct emissions. Forest management and
   fire-control activities may help reduce wildfire severity and mitigate
   the associated pulse of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.}},

Title = {{Slash Pile Burn Scar Restoration: Tradeoffs between Abundance of
   Non-Native and Native Species}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The accumulation of live and dead trees and other vegetation in forests
   across the western United States is producing larger and more severe
   wildfires. To decrease wildfire severity and increase forest resilience,
   foresters regularly remove excess fuel by burning woody material in
   piles. This common practice could also cause persistent ecosystem
   changes such as the alteration of soil physical and chemical properties
   due to extreme soil heating, which can favor invasion by non-native
   plant species. The abundance and species richness of native plant
   communities may also remain depressed for many years after burning has
   removed vegetation and diminished propagules in the soil. This adds to
   the vulnerability of burned areas to the colonization and dominance by
   invasive species. Research into the use of revegetation techniques
   following pile burning to suppress invasion is limited. Studies
   conducted in various woodland types that investigated revegetation of
   pile burn scars have met with varying success. To assess the
   effectiveness of restoring pile burn scars in Rocky Mountain National
   Park, Colorado, we monitored vegetation in 26 scars, each about 5 m in
   diameter, the growing season after burning. Later that summer, we
   selected 14 scars for restoration that included soil scarification, seed
   addition, and pine duff mulch cover. We monitored the scars for four
   years, pre-restoration, and three years post-restoration and found that
   the cover of seeded species exceeded the surrounding unburned areas and
   unseeded controls. The restoration seeding suppressed cover of
   non-native species as well as native species that were not seeded during
   restoration. Our results suggest that restoration of pile burn scars
   could be a useful tool to retard the establishment of invasive plant
   species when there are pre-existing infestations near scars. However,
   this must be weighed against the simultaneous suppression of native
   species recruitment. Monitoring for periods more than three years will
   help us understand how long the suppression of native and non-native
   species by restoration species may persist.}},

Abstract = {{Fire, the primary natural disturbance factor in Fennoscandian boreal
   forests, is considered to have exerted major selection pressure on most
   boreal forest organisms. However, recent studies show that few
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi appear to have evolved post-fire adaptations,
   no succession of EM fungi following fire is apparent after low intensity
   fires, and only two EM fungal taxa exclusively fruit at post-fire
   conditions. In this paper I review the present knowledge of effects of
   forest fire on EM fungal communities in Fennscandian boreal forests, put
   into perspective by a comparison from other parts of the world.
   Characteristically, these boreal forests consist of less than a handful
   of tree species, e.g. Scots pine and Norway spruce, while the below
   ground communities of EM fungi is impressively species rich with
   presently more than 700 known taxa. Commonly, forest fires in
   Fennoscandia have been of low intensity, with a considerable portion of
   the trees surviving and the organic humus layer partly escaping
   combustion. Hence, EM fungi appear to largely have evolved under
   conditions characterised by a more or less continuous presence of their
   hosts. In fact, the composition of EM fungi within a forest appear be
   more variable due to spatial variation than due to wildfire. However, in
   areas with high intensity bums and high tree mortality, most EM fungi
   may locally be killed. Thus, the legacy of EM fungi following wildfire
   depends on the survival of trees, which determine the potential for
   mycorrhizal growth, and the combustion and heating of the organic soil,
   which directly correlate to mortality of mycorrhizas. The questions if
   and to what degree fires may be of significance for yet unidentified
   spatiotemporal dynamics of EM fungal populations and communities are
   discussed. Recent experiments indicate a few EM fungi are favoured by
   high intensity burn conditions whereas others disappear. The
   consequences of wildfires in temperate conifer forests differ
   considerably from those in boreal forests. Wildfires in temperate
   conifer forests are typically high intensity stand-replacing fires that
   cause a total combustion of organic layers. Subsequently, pre-fire EM
   fungal communities are largely eradicated and a succession of post-fire
   EM fungi is initiated.}},

Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Developing a predictive understanding of how species assemblages
   respond to fire is a key conservation goal. In moving from solely
   describing patterns following fire to predicting changes, plant
   ecologists have successfully elucidated generalizations based on
   functional traits. Using species traits might also allow better
   predictions for fauna, but there are few empirical tests of this
   approach.
   2. We examined whether species traits changed with post-fire age for
   spiders in 27 sites, representing a chronosequence of 0-20 years
   post-fire. We predicted a priori whether spiders with ten traits
   associated with survival, dispersal, reproduction, resource-utilization
   and microhabitat occupation would increase or decrease with post-fire
   age. We then tested these predictions using a direct (fourth-corner on
   individual traits and composite traits) and an indirect (emergent
   groups) approach, comparing the benefits of each and also examining the
   degree to which traits were intercorrelated.
   3. For the seven individual traits that were significant, three followed
   predictions (body size, abundance of burrow ambushers and burrowers was
   greater in recently burnt sites); two were opposite (species with heavy
   sclerotisation of the cephalothorax and longer time to maturity were in
   greater abundance in long unburnt and recently burnt sites
   respectively); and two displayed response patterns more complex than
   predicted (abdominal scutes displayed a U-shaped response and dispersal
   ability a hump shaped curve). However, within a given trait, there were
   few significant differences among post-fire ages.
   4. Several traits were intercorrelated and scores based on composite
   traits used in a fourth-corner analysis found significant patterns, but
   slightly different to those using individual traits. Changes in
   abundance with post-fire age were significant for three of the five
   emergent groups. The fourth-corner analysis yielded more detailed
   results, but overall we consider the two approaches complementary.
   5. While we found significant differences in traits with post-fire age,
   our results suggest that a trait-based approach may not increase
   predictive power, at least for the assemblages of spiders we studied.
   That said, there are many refinements to faunal traits that could
   increase predictive power.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: (i) What is the impact of legacy structures on lichen
   assemblage development up to two decades post-fire? (ii) How does that
   impact vary among ecological groups? (iii) Are charcoal-inhabiting
   lichen assemblages regionally distinct?
   Location: Hemiboreal pine forests, Estonia, and middle-boreal pine
   forests, eastern Finland.
   Methods: We performed standard lichen surveys (4 hr effort per 2 ha
   plot; on all substrates 0-2 m from the forest floor) and measured forest
   structure in 18 burned sites (nine in Finland and nine in Estonia). The
   sites included both old (15-21 years) and recent (9 years) fires, and
   half of the latter had been harvested for timber. We analysed lichen
   assemblages (full assemblages and different ecological groups) in
   relation to site factors (GLM for species richness; multivariate
   techniques for assemblage composition).
   Results: Lichen assemblages on burned sites (altogether 187 species
   recorded) were regionally distinct and, additionally, significantly
   affected by the large variation in legacy and regeneration abundance
   among sites. Species richness was negatively related to abundance of
   fallen trees 9 years after fire but the relationship was positive 15-21
   years post-fire; this pattern indicated a change from the initial damage
   effect to a substrate-providing effect of the fire. Microlichens and
   vegetatively dispersing lichens appeared more sensitive to disturbance
   (including harvesting), whereas macrolichens were more responsive to
   substrate provision. The main structural influences on lichens
   inhabiting charred substrates (67 species recorded in total) were
   similar to the factors affecting the composition of full lichen
   assemblages.
   Conclusions: Within 10 years post-fire, initial disturbance-related
   damage to forest lichen assemblages was replaced by the dominance of
   substrate-providing factors (legacies, regeneration). These damage and
   recovery phases differ among lichen groups, but are consistent between
   hemi- and middle-boreal regions. The availability of post-fire legacies,
   including charred surfaces, is of critical importance for the management
   of burned areas in modern landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of fire severity on Pinus pinaster growth and

   1300 hectares of vegetation, mainly P. pinaster woods, were destroyed,
   four sites were selected according to the different degree of fire

   isotopes and percentage of crown scorched or consumed was applied. All
   the sampled trees in the burned sites showed a decrease in tree growth

   Further delta C-13 and delta O-18 underlined the ecophysiological
   responses and recovery mechanisms of P. pinaster, suggesting a drastic
   reduction of photosynthetic and stomata activity in the year of the
   fire. Our findings demonstrated that P. pinaster growth reduction is
   strictly linked to the percentage of crown scorch and that even trees
   with high level of crown scorched could survive. In all the burned sites
   the high temperatures and the time of exposure to the flames were not
   sufficient to determine the death of the cambium and all the trees were

Abstract = {{1 Both fire regimes and the conditions under which fires occur vary
   widely. Abiotic conditions (such as climate) in combination with fire
   season, frequency and intensity could influence vegetation responses to
   fire. A variety of adaptations facilitate post-fire recruitment in
   mediterranean climate ecosystems, but responses of other communities are
   less well known. We evaluated the importance of climate by comparing
   sites with mediterranean and subtropical climates.
   2 We used paired burned and mature sites in chamise chaparral, mixed
   chaparral and coastal sage scrub (California), and rosemary scrub, sand
   pine scrub and sandhill (Florida), to test whether (i) patterns of
   pre-fire and post-fire seedling recruitment are more similar between
   communities within a region than between regions, and (ii) post-fire
   stimulation of seedling establishment is greater in regions with marked
   fire-induced contrasts in abiotic site characteristics.
   3 Post-fire seedling densities were more similar among sites within
   climatic regions than between regions. Both seedling densities and
   proportions of species represented by seedlings after fires were
   generally higher in California.
   4 The only site characteristic showing a pre-fire-post-fire contrast was
   percentage open canopy, and the effect was greater in California than in
   Florida. Soil properties were unaffected by fire.
   5 Mediterranean climate ecosystems in other regions have nutrient-poor
   soils similar to our subtropical Florida sites, but show post-fire
   seedling recruitment patterns more similar to the nutrient-rich sites in
   California. Climate therefore appears to play a more major role than

   (Picea glauca) with little aspen (Populus tremuloides) comprised most of
   the study area during the last fire cycle. Although spruce seedling
   recruitment after the fire was highest at sites near unburned seed
   sources and where surface organic layers were shallow, spruce seedling
   densities were often insufficient to regenerate the pre-fire spruce
   forests. In particular, sites in the warmer topographic locations of the
   valley lowland and south-facing slopes typically had few spruce
   seedlings and instead were dominated by aspen. The opposite pattern was
   observed on north-facing slopes. Age reconstructions of pre- and
   post-fire stands indicate that future canopy composition is driven by
   initial post-fire recruitment and thus observed landscape differences in
   seedling recruitment are likely to be maintained through the next
   100-200 years of succession. Observed results support the hypothesis
   that sites experiencing greater environmental stress show the lowest
   resilience to disturbance, or greatest compositional changes. Analyses
   of tree-ring responses to climate variables across the same landscape
   indicate that patterns of tree growth prior to a disturbance may be a
   useful predictor of landscape variations in forest resilience, allowing
   managers to better anticipate where future changes in forest composition
   are likely to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is the largest disturbance affecting northern peatlands;
   however, little is known about how burn severity (organic soil depth of
   burn) alters post-fire hydrological conditions that control the recovery
   of keystone peatland mosses (i.e. Sphagnum). For this reason, we
   assessed the impact of burn severity on moss water availability by
   measuring soil tension () and surface volumetric moisture content () in
   burned and unburned portions of a peatland complex 2years after fire. We
   found that both high and low burn severity decreased post-fire water
   availability by altering peat hydrophysical properties (moisture
   retention and water repellency). Locations covered by Sphagnum fuscum
   prior to fire exhibited a decreasing post-fire water availability with
   an increasing burn severity. In contrast, the lowest water availability
   (>400cm, <002) was observed in feather mosses that underwent low burn
   severity (residual branches identifiable). Deep burning (>020m) in
   peatland margins and burn depths >005m in the middle of the peatland
   exhibited the highest water availability (<60cm). Locations with low
   surface and high , notably feather mosses undergoing low burn severity,
   exhibited minimal moss recolonization. Such areas dominate post-fire
   surface cover (similar to 40\%) within late successional (mature)
   peatlands or peatlands located in dry hydrological settings. We argue
   that such environments are under-represented in conceptual models of
   post-fire recovery. A new conceptual model is proposed in which (1) deep
   burning is counterbalanced by rapid recolonization and (2) pre-fire
   species interact with burn severity to produce substantial lags in
   post-fire moss recovery. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fire severity influences the recovery and biodiversity of plant
   communities. We compared the early post-fire recovery of plant
   functional groups in two sites (one burnt with high severity and one
   with low severity) in the north-western Patagonian steppe. We sampled
   the post-fire soil seed banks, as well as the composition and cover of
   aboveground plant species, and calculated richness, diversity and the
   percentage of exotic species. Low fire severity increased the diversity
   of aboveground vegetation and seed banks, whereas high fire severity
   reduced the cover of all functional groups, with the exception of
   fugitive species. Tiller production of perennial grasses decreased due
   to bud bank mortality. In the seed bank, high severity fire reduced
   fugitive species and increased exotic species. Fugitive species need
   fire to recruit, and the combination of fire cues and post-fire
   environmental conditions can explain the high abundance of these species
   after fire. In Patagonia, the use of fire is not considered a management
   option because fires are believed to be dangerous to humans, goods and
   services. However, north-western Patagonia is sparsely populated and the
   frequent wildfires pose no danger. It is necessary to increase the
   knowledge of the ecological processes of Patagonian ecosystems related
   to fire regime and land use, to achieve a reasonable balance between
   sustainable use and conservation in this region.}},

Title = {{Post-fire mulching for runoff and erosion mitigation Part I:
   Effectiveness at reducing hillslope erosion rates}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{75-92}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mulch treatments often are used to mitigate post-fire increases in
   runoff and erosion rates but the comparative effectiveness of various
   mulches is not well established. The ability of mulch treatments to
   reduce sediment yields from natural rainfall and resulting overland flow
   was measured using hillslope plots on areas burned at high severity
   following four wildfires in the western United States. Wheat straw
   mulch, wood strand mulch, and hydromulch were evaluated along with
   untreated control plots on multiple fires for 4 to 7 years after
   burning. Needle cast from fire-killed conifer trees was evaluated in an
   area of moderate burn severity at one fire, and seeding with genetically
   native seed was tested, with and without hydromulch, at another fire.
   Rainfall, ground cover, and soil water repellency were measured in each
   treatment site at all 4 fires. Mean sediment yields on the control plots
   ranged from 0.3 to 7.5 Mg ha(-1) in the first post-fire year, from 0.03
   to 0.6 Mg ha(-1) in the second, and from 0 to 0.4 Mg ha(-1) in the third
   and fourth post-fire years. Assuming a linear fit between sediment yield
   and rainfall intensify, storms with equivalent rainfall intensities
   produced nearly an order of magnitude less sediment on the control plots
   in the second post-fire year as compared to the first post-fire year.
   Large storms (at least a 2-year return period, 10-min maximum rainfall
   intensity) produced sediment on all fires in all years where they
   occurred; however, sediment yields produced by large storms that
   occurred in the first post-fire year were larger than the sediment
   yields from equivalent storms that occurred in later years at the same
   fire. Sediment yields decreased as ground cover increased and all the
   mulch treatments increased total ground cover to more than 60\%
   immediately after application. However, the longevity of the mulches
   varied, so that the contribution of the treatment mulch to total ground
   cover varied by mulch type over time. The wood strand mulch was the most
   long-lived of the mulch treatments and was observed in ground cover
   assessments throughout the study period (4 and 7 years) at two fires.
   The wheat straw mulch decreased nearly twice as fast as the wood strand
   mulch, and no hydromulch was detected after the first post-fire year on
   either fire where it was tested.
   Mulch treatment effectiveness varied when data were analyzed separately
   for each fire. Wood strand mulch reduced sediment yields at both fires
   where it was tested, wheat straw mulch reduced sediment yields at 2 of
   the 4 fires where it was applied, and the hydromulch tested at 2 fires
   did not reduce sediment yields on either. When data were normalized and
   analyzed by treatment across all fires, wood strand mulch reduced
   sediment yields for the first four post-fire years, but wheat straw
   mulch and hydromulch did not significantly reduce sediment yields in any
   post-fire year. The greater variability in the combined data resulted in
   fewer statistically significant treatment effects being observed as
   compared to the individual fire analyses. We believe the fire-specific
   results provide the more accurate representation of potential post-fire
   mulch treatment effectiveness. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires commonly result in an increase in stream turbidity. However,
   the influence of pre-fire land-use practices on post-fire stream
   turbidity is not well understood. The Lower Cotter Catchment (LCC) in
   south-eastern Australia is part of the main water supply catchment for
   Canberra with land in the catchment historically managed for a mix of
   conservation (native eucalypt forest) and pine (Pinus radiata)
   plantation. In January 2003, wildfires burned almost all of the native
   and pine forests in the LCC. A study was established in 2005 to
   determine stream post-fire turbidity recovery within the native and pine
   forest areas of the catchment. Turbidity data loggers were deployed in
   two creeks within burned native forest and burned pine forest areas to
   determine turbidity response to fire in these areas. As a part of the
   study, we also determined changes in bare soil in the native and pine
   forest areas since the fire. The results suggest that the time, it takes
   turbidity levels to decrease following wildfire, is dependent upon the
   preceding land-use. In the LCC, turbidity levels decreased more rapidly
   in areas previously with native vegetation compared to areas which were
   previously used for pine forestry. This is likely because of a higher
   percentage of bare soil areas for a longer period of time in the ex-pine
   forest estate and instream stores of fine sediment from catchment
   erosion during post-fire storm events. The results of our study show
   that the previous land-use may exert considerable control over on-going
   turbidity levels following a wildfire.}},

Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{455-466}},
Abstract = {{Our research was conducted on abandoned fields which had been undergoing
   spontaneous succession for 40-50 years and then were partly burnt. The
   main objective of the study was to examine if spontaneous fire in the
   early successional stage of pine forest causes a decrease in the number
   of species, diversity and density of seed banks, and an increase in the
   share of species forming long term persistent seed banks. Standing
   vegetation and soil seed banks were studied on 20 permanent plots on
   adjacent burnt and unburnt sites one and twelve years after spontaneous
   fire. One year after the fire the number of species in the seed banks of
   both areas was similar (11 and 12 species). In the burnt area the
   Shannon index and the floristical similarity between the seed bank and
   standing vegetation were lower, and seed density five times higher than
   in the unburnt area (15 691.5 m(-2) vs.3426.5 m(-2)). This was mainly
   the effect of the high number of seedlings of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull
   and Spergula morisonii Boreau germinating from the burnt plots. Twelve
   years after the fire the number of species in both seed banks had
   increased little, but seed density in the burnt area (1742.5 m(-2)) had
   decreased 16 times, while that of the unbumt area had changed only
   slightly (2875.5 m(-2)). At the same time the Shannon index for the
   burnt area increased considerably, whereas for the unburnt one it did
   not change. Our study shows that the long-term persistent soil seed bank
   plays a fundamental role at the beginning of the post-fire regeneration
   of temperate coniferous forest vegetation. Germination of Calluna
   seedlings from the burnt soil seed banks in several times higher numbers
   than from unburnt soil seed banks may suggest that heat from the fire
   promotes a loss of dormancy in the heather seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Woody vegetation can create distinct subcanopy and interspace
   microsites, which often result in resource islands in subcanopies

   contributes to herbaceous vegetation heterogeneity in plant communities.
   However, information detailing the impact of disturbance, such as fire,
   that removes the woody vegetation on microsites and herbaceous
   vegetation heterogeneity is limited. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the influence of burning on microsites and herbaceous
   vegetation in subcanopies and interspaces. Six study sites (blocks) were
   located at the Northern Great Basin Experimental Range in shrub
   (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis (Beetle \& A. Young) S.L.
   Welsh)-bunchgrass plant communities and one half of each block was
   burned to remove A. tridentata. Herbaceous vegetation and microsite
   characteristics were measured 2 years post-fire in intact and burned
   subcanopies and interspaces. Burning resulted in microsite and
   herbaceous vegetation differences between intact and burned subcanopies
   and intact and burned interspaces. However, burned subcanopies and
   burned interspaces appeared to be relatively similar. The similarity in
   microsite characteristics probably explains the lack of differences in
   herbaceous vegetation cover and biomass production between burned
   subcanopies and burned interspaces (P > 0.05). However, some microsite
   and herbaceous vegetation characteristics differed between burned
   subcanopies and burned interspaces. Our results suggest that
   disturbances that remove woody vegetation reduced microsite and
   herbaceous vegetation heterogeneity within plant communities, but do not
   completely remove the resource island effect. This suggests soil
   resource heterogeneity may influence post-fire community assembly and
   contribute to diversity maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionIn fire-prone boreal forests, to what extent does fire severity
   influence understorey plant community assembly? What are the abiotic and
   biotic factors controlling understorey community regeneration at
   regional, landscape and local scales?
   LocationBlack spruce-dominated boreal forest in eastern Canada.
   MethodsA taxonomic and a trait-based approach were combined to evaluate
   the relative influence of habitat characteristics, burn severity and
   biotic processes on understorey regeneration at multiple spatial scales.
   Sampling of understorey vegetation cover was carried out in 133 recently
   burned plots located in 14 different fires across a 600-km transect. The
   spatial hierarchy for sampling consisted of five fire regime zones
   (regional scale), two to four fires within each zone (landscape) and two
   to four toposequences within each fire (local). The environmental
   control of fire severity and habitat characteristics on understorey
   regeneration was assessed using a canonical redundancy analysis (RDA)
   and variation partitioning. We investigated environmental and biotic
   filters of species traits at different scales by modelling trait-spatial
   assemblages with Moran eigen vector maps (MEMs).
   ResultsIn spite of the large variability of environmental conditions
   covered by our sampling design, low depths of burn were measured in the
   large majority of the studied sites. Incomplete consumption of the
   forest floor is frequently observed in eastern boreal forests
   characterized by long fire cycles. In situ biological legacies persisted
   through the low-severity fires, which conserved the pre-fire
   relationships between plant communities and their environment. As a
   result, fire severity was neither the unique nor the dominant control on
   post-fire regeneration. Habitat characteristics explained a three times
   higher proportion of variation in species composition. Biotic controls
   on trait assemblage increased at the two finer scales.
   ConclusionsSeverity alone cannot predict understorey vegetation assembly
   at different scales in the low-severity fire regime characteristic of
   the eastern North American boreal forest.}},

Abstract = {{The two major forms of disturbance in the montane ash eucalypt forests
   of the Central Highlands of Victoria (southeastern Australia) are
   clearfell logging and unplanned wildfires. Since the 1930s wildfire has
   been followed by intensive and extensive salvage-logging operations,
   which may proceed for many years after a wildfire has occurred. Although
   applied widely, the potential effects of salvage logging on native flora
   and fauna have been poorly studied. Our data indicate that the abundance
   of large trees with hollows is significantly reduced in forests subject
   to salvage harvesting. This has implications for the persistence of an
   array of such cavity-using vertebrates as the endangered arboreal
   marsupial, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelidues leadbeateri). Salvage
   logging also reduces the prevalence of multiaged montane ash
   forests-places that typically support the highest diversity of arboreal
   marsupials and forest birds. Limited research has been conducted on the
   effects of salvage logging on plants; thus, we constructed hypotheses
   about potential impacts for further testing based on known responses to
   clearfell logging and key life history attributes. We predict many
   species, such as vegetatively resprouting tree ferns, will decline, as
   they do after clearfelling. We also suggest that seed regenerators,
   which typically regenerate well after fire or conventional clearfelling,
   will decline after salvage logging because the stimulation for
   germination (fire) takes place prior to mechanical disturbance
   (logging). Understory plant communities in salvage-logged areas will be
   dominated by a smaller suite of species, and those that are wind
   dispersed, have viable soil-stored seed remaining after salvage logging,
   or have deep rhizomes are likely to be advantaged. We recommend the
   following improvements to salvage-logging policies that may better
   incorporate conservation needs in Victorian montane ash forests: (1)
   exemption of salvage logging from some areas (e.g., old-growth stands
   and places subject to only partial stand damage); (2) increased
   retention of biological legacies on burned areas through variations in
   the intensity of salvage logging; and (3) reduction in the levels of
   physical disturbance on salvage-logged areas, especially through limited
   seedbed preparation and mechanical disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure is presented that allows identifying large burned scars and
   the monitoring of vegetation recovery in the years following major fire
   episodes. The procedure relies on 10-day fields of Maximum Value
   Composites of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MVC-NDVI), with a
   1 kmx1 km spatial resolution obtained from the VEGETATION instrument.
   The identification of fire scars during the extremely severe 2003 fire
   season is performed based on cluster analysis of NDVI anomalies that
   persist during the vegetative cycle of the year following the fire
   event. Two regions containing very large burned scars were selected,
   located in Central and Southwestern Portugal, respectively, and time
   series of MVC-NDVI analysed before the fire events took place and
   throughout the post-fire period. It is shown that post-fire vegetation
   dynamics in the two selected regions may be characterised based on maps
   of recovery rates as estimated by fitting a monoparametric model of
   vegetation recovery to MVC-NDVI data over each burned scar. Results
   indicated that the recovery process in the region located in Central
   Portugal is mostly related to fire damage rather than to vegetation
   density before 2003, whereas the latter seems to have a more prominent
   role than vegetation conditions after the fire episode, e.g. in the case
   of the region in Southwestern Portugal. These differences are consistent
   with the respective predominant types of vegetation. The burned area
   located in Central Portugal is dominated by Pinus Pinaster whose natural
   regeneration crucially depends on the destruction of seeds present on
   the soil surface during the fire, whereas the burned scar in
   Southwestern Portugal was populated by Eucalyptus that may quickly
   re-sprout from buds after fire. Besides its simplicity, the
   monoparametric model of vegetation recovery has the advantage of being
   easily adapted to other low-resolution satellite data, as well as to
   other types of vegetation indices.}},

Abstract = {{Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, comprising 3,705 hectares, is part of a
   large National Park Unit, Gateway National Recreation Area, New York,

   of Congress in 1972, to preserve the science, beauty, flora, fauna, and
   recreational opportunities of the estuaries and beaches in the New York
   City metropolitan area. Gateway is the United States' first urban
   national park, Urban and industrial developments have modified the
   natural environment by grading and filling, construction, pollution from
   biological and chemical contaminants and over harvesting or eradication
   of native plant species. Despite these impacts, the natural environment
   and many native plants have been remarkably preserved, Within the
   wildlife refuge are a variety of habitats including salt marsh,
   successional old fields, shrublands, woodlands, freshwater wetlands
   dominated by Phragmites australis, fresh and brackish-water
   impoundments, and several old landfill sites. Here we report on an
   aspect of a large comprehensive study dealing with the restoration of
   the Jamaica Bay ecosystem. We present information on enhancing and
   maintaining plant biodiversity in an urban wildlife refuge. Our initial
   objective has been to prepare a complete floristic inventory of the
   refuge, involving vegetation sampling, herbarium work, and voucher
   specimen deposition. Identified to date are 330 species of vascular
   plants. Once the plants have been completely inventoried, we will
   suggest recommendations to maintain and/or increase plant biodiversity
   at the refuge. The creation of new habitats such as freshwater
   impoundments, the introduction of native species, arresting community
   development by selectively cutting, mowing or burning will provide
   habitat supporting a more diverse number of species.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plant encroachment can increase nutrient resources in the
   plant-mound zone. After a fire, this zone is often found to be water
   repellent. This study aimed to understand the effects of post-fire water
   repellency on soil water and inorganic nitrogen and their effects on
   plant growth of the introduced annual Bromus tectorum and native
   bunchgrass Pseudoroegneria spicata. Plots centered on burned Juniperus
   osteosperma trees were either left untreated or treated with surfactant
   to ameliorate water repellency. After two years, we excavated soil from
   the untreated and treated plots and placed it in zero tension lysimeter
   pots. In the greenhouse, half of the pots received an additional
   surfactant treatment. Pots were seeded separately with B. tectorum or P.
   spicata. Untreated soils had high runoff, decreased soil water content,
   and elevated NO3-N in comparison to surfactant treated soils. The two
   plant species typically responded similar to the treatments.
   Above-ground biomass and microbial activity (estimated through soil CO2
   gas emissions) was 16.8-fold and 9.5-fold higher in the
   surfactant-treated soils than repellent soils, respectably. This study
   demonstrates that water repellency can influence site recovery by
   decreasing soil water content, promoting inorganic N retention, and
   impairing plant growth and microbial activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Fire is an important disturbance influencing Mediterranean vegetation
   dynamics. Although many studies have documented its impact on
   vegetation, none have focused on the influence of spatial
   characteristics of the burned area on plant regeneration. In particular,
   the distance from unburned areas must be considered because (i) it
   represents the distance that seeds must cover to recolonize the burned
   area, and (ii) it is also related to the intensity of fire.
   At four sites, burned in 1998 or in 2000 in the Aix-Marseille region, we
   examined the effects of spatial characteristics of the fire on the
   post-fire dynamics. We sampled aboveground vegetation, seed rain, seed
   bank, and soil, along several transects from unburned/burned limit to
   the center of burned areas.
   The present paper describes the vegetation gradients, both at a
   taxonomic and at a functional level, along the transects. We show that
   spatial characteristics of the burned areas, specifically the distance
   from unburned areas, through the distribution of the seed rain and
   through variation of soil characteristics, may explain certain aspects
   of the post-fire dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Based on 120 stem discs collected during 3 months of fieldwork along a
   12 km route, the history of fires in the Wari Maro Forest (09A degrees
   10'0 N-02A degrees 10'0E) over the past century in savanna woodland and
   dry forest was reconstituted. Three major ecological areas are
   characterized: one highly burnt zone located between two relative less
   burnt areas. By analyzing tree rings, 246 fire scars were identified.
   The scars were caused by 51 fire years, occurring at a mean interval of
   2.23 years. From 1890 to 1965, only 6 years with fires were recorded
   from sampled trees. Since 1966, no year has passed without fire. The
   fire frequency point scale reached 14 years. This was the case of Burkea
   africana, which has been identified as a species tolerant to fire and
   could be planted to create a natural firewall. In contrast, Anogeissus
   leiocarpa is highly sensitive to fire, and in a dry forest ecosystem
   that burns seasonally, it requires a special conservation plan. Two new
   concepts are described: the rebarking of trees after fire and Mean
   Kilometer Fire Interval. The first concept was tested with Daniellia
   oliveri (Rolfe) Hutch \& Dalz trees, and the second concept was used to
   evaluate spatial fire distribution. We demonstrate that savanna woodland
   and dry forest were subject to a degradation process caused by
   destructive fires related to vegetation cover clearance and illegal

Abstract = {{The increasing frequency of fires inhibits the estimation of carbon
   reserves in boreal forest ecosystems because fires release significant
   amounts of carbon into the atmosphere through combustion. However, less
   is known regarding the effects of vegetation succession processes on
   ecosystem C-flux that follow fires. This paper describes intra- and
   inter-annual vegetation restoration trajectories via MODIS time-series
   and Landsat data. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the
   natural succession were analyzed from 2000 to 2016. Finally, we
   regressed post-fire MODIS EVI, LST and LSWI values onto GPP and NPP
   values to identify the main limiting factors during post-fire carbon
   exchange. The results show immediate variations after the fire event,
   with EVI and LSWI decreasing by 0.21 and 0.31, respectively, and the LST
   increasing to 6.89 degrees C. After this initial variation, subsequent
   fire-induced variations were significantly smaller; instead, seasonality
   began governing the change characteristics. The greatest differences in
   EVI, LST and LSWI were observed in August and September compared to
   those in other months (0.29, 6.9 and 0.35, respectively), including
   July, which was the second month after the fire. We estimated the mean
   EVI recovery periods under different fire intensities (approximately 10,
   12 and 16 years): the LST recovery time is one year earlier than that of
   the EVI. GPP and NPP decreased after the fire by 22-45 g
   C.m(-2).month(-1) (30-80\%) and 0.13-0.35 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) (20-60\%),
   respectively. Excluding the winter period, when no photosynthesis
   occurred, the correlation between the EVI and GPP was the strongest, and
   the correlation coefficient varied with the burn intensity. When changes
   in EVI, LST and LSWI after the fire in the boreal forest were more
   significant, the severity of the fire determined the magnitude of the
   changes, and the seasonality aggravated these changes. On the other
   hand, the seasonality is another important factor that affects
   vegetation restoration and land-surface energy fluxes in boreal forests.
   The strong correlations between EVI and GPP/NPP reveal that the C-flux
   can be simply and directly estimated on a per-pixel basis from EVI data,
   which can be used to accurately estimate land-surface energy fluxes
   during vegetation restoration and reduce uncertainties in the estimation
   of forests' carbon reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are designated as
   threatened under Canada's Species at Risk Act. A Recovery Strategy for
   the boreal population of caribou identified critical habitat for all but
   1 of 51 caribou ranges - Saskatchewan's Boreal Shield (SK1). The
   strategy identified 65\% undisturbed habitat as the threshold below
   which a local population was not likely to be self-sustaining.
   Disturbance was measured as the combined effects of fires <40 years and
   anthropogenic land use. The fire component of the total disturbance
   model used fire polygons that were delineated using traditional mapping
   methods. Our study maps fire from 1988-2013 using the differenced
   Normalized Burn Ratio analysis of Landsat Thematic mapper and
   Operational Land Imager. Annual burned areas based on fire perimeters
   were similar between traditionally and Landsat-derived inventory
   approaches, but the traditional methods overestimated within-burn areas
   by 31.8\%, as a result of including post-fire residuals and water bodies
   as burned. The federal recovery model assumes that all lands within
   provincial fire polygons (<40 years) are inadequate as caribou habitat,
   and ignores the potential value of post-fire residuals and water bodies
   as habitat. For some Boreal Shield ranges including SKI, where fire
   comprises the majority of the total disturbance and residual patches are
   abundant, total disturbance calculations, critical habitat designation
   and range planning decisions should take into account residuals,

Abstract = {{The effects of fire recurrence on vegetation patterns in Quercus suber L
   and Erica-Cistus communities in Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems of
   south-eastern France were examined on stands belonging to 5 fire
   classes, corresponding to different numbers of fires (from 0 to 4) and
   time intervals between fires since 1959. A common pool of species was
   identified among the plots, which was typical of both open and closed
   maquis. Fire recurrence reduced the abundance of trees and herbs,
   whereas it increased the abundance of small shrubs. Richness differed
   significantly between the most contrasting classes of fire recurrence,
   with maximal values found in control plots and minimal values in plots
   that had burned recurrently and recently. Equitability indices did not
   vary significantly, in contrast to Shannon's diversity index which
   mostly correlated with richness. Forest ecosystems that have burnt once
   or twice in the last 50 years were resilient; that is to say they
   recovered a biomass and composition similar to that of the pre-fire
   state. However, after more than 3-4 fires, shrubland communities
   displayed lower species richness and diversity indices than unburned
   plots. The time since the last fire and the number of fires were the
   most explanatory fire variables, governing the structure of post-fire
   plant communities. However, environmental factors, such as slope or
   exposure, also made a significant contribution. Higher rates of fire
   recurrence can affect the persistence or expansion of shrublands in the
   future, as observed in other Mediterranean areas. (C) 2012 Academie des

Abstract = {{Rainfall simulations allow for controlled comparisons of runoff and
   erosion among ecosystems and land cover conditions. Runoff and erosion
   can increase greatly following fire, yet there are few rainfall
   simulation studies for post-fire plots, particularly after severe fire
   in semiarid forest. We conducted rainfall simulations shortly after a
   severe fire (Cerro Grande) in ponderosa pine forest near Los Alamos, New
   Mexico, USA, which completely burned organic ground cover and exposed
   unprotected soil. Measurements on burned plots showed 74\% of mineral
   soil was exposed compared with an estimated 3\% exposed prior to the
   fire. Most of the remaining 26\% surface area was covered by easily
   moveable ash. Rainfall was applied at 60 mm h(-1) in three repeated
   tests over 2 days. Runoff from burned plots was about 45\% of the total
   120 mm of applied precipitation, but only 23\% on the unburned plots.
   The most striking difference between the response of burned and unburned
   plots was the amount of sediment production; burned plots generated 25
   times more sediment than unburned plots (76 kg ha(-1) and 3 kg ha(-1)
   respectively per millimetre of rain). Sediment yields were well
   correlated with percentage bare soil (r = 0.84). These sediment yields
   were more than an order of magnitude greater than nearly all comparable
   rainfall simulation studies conducted on burned plots in the USA, most
   of which have been in grasslands or shrublands. A synthesis of
   comparable studies suggests that an erosion threshold is reached as the
   amount of soil exposed by fire increases to 60-70\%. Our results provide
   sediment yield and runoff data from severely burned surfaces, a
   condition for which little rainfall simulation data exist. Further, our
   results contrast post-fire hydrologic responses in forests with those in
   grasslands and shrublands. These results can be applied to problems
   concerning post-fire erosion, flooding, contaminant transport, and
   development of associated remediation strategies. Copyright (C) 2001

   However, there was an adverse effect on productivity at nests that
   directly experienced fire and the accompanying heat and smoke in the
   vicinity, resulting in a post-fire nest success (62\%) that was
   significantly lower than in previous years (78.6-80\%). Population
   recruitment dropped by an estimated 47\% to 0.17 fledglings/breeding

   hypothesis we measured levels of herpetofaunal (amphibian and reptile)
   endemicity between primary forest, montane secondary heathland, and high
   plateau prairie. We found no species endemic to high plateau prairie, bu
   a significant percentage of the montane herpetofauna is restricted no
   species endemic to high plateau prairie, but a significant percentage of
   the montane herpetofauna is restricted to post-fire secondary heathland.
   These results support the human-origin hypothesis for prairie, but
   secondary heathland appears to be a natural, post-fire successional
   stage that leads to a climax of sclerophyllous forest. This suggest that
   careful management of montane heathland could establish ne dispersal
   corridors between currently isolated montane forest blocks and,
   therefore, could offer new opportunities for conservation in Madagascar.
   Despite widespread burning, the montane heathlands of Madagascar have
   diverse herpetofaunal communities, demonstrating that these montane
   communities are not as seriously degraded as previously believed, and
   that they may be naturally resistant to fire.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire coarse woody debris can represent a valuable nutrient
   reservoir for a regenerating ecosystem, helping to prevent soil
   fertility losses after a wildfire. However, there is scarce information
   on its effect on soil nutrient cycling and availability. We established
   three study sites along an altitudinal gradient in a burnt pine forest
   (SE Spain). At each site we determined: (1) decomposition rates and
   nutrient dynamics in charred logs left on the ground, 2 and 4 years
   after the fire, and (2) available nutrients in the soil and in the
   microbial fraction below charred logs and in bare soil areas. Despite
   the relatively slow decay rates in this Mediterranean climate (ca. 10 \%
   of dry weight lost after 4 years), N and P were progressively released
   by logs, accounting for ca. 40 and 65 \% of the initial content
   respectively after 4 years. This implies that the total aboveground
   biomass of the burnt forest released around 20 kg ha(-1) of N and 2 kg
   ha(-1) of P during this period. The presence of post fire coarse woody
   debris consistently increased soil organic matter by around 18 \%, total
   C and N by 42 and 26 \%, respectively, dissolved organic C and N by 47
   \%, available inorganic P by 68 \%, and microbial biomass and nitrogen
   by some 36 and 48 \%, respectively. By contrast, soil bulk density
   decreased by ca. 18 \% under logs compared to bare areas. Thus, the
   fire-killed wood was useful in the recovery of soil fertility and
   nutrient availability. Leaving the post-fire woody debris on site can
   enhance the biogeochemical sustainability, microbiological processes and
   soil ecological functioning. The detrimental effect of post-fire salvage
   logging on soil fertility should be therefore considered when making
   management decisions.}},

   Data were collected from a total of 15 plots (five plots per stratum)
   measuring 20 m x 60 m between April and May 2014. The following
   variables were recorded in each plot: species name, plant height, and
   number of woody plants. A total of 37 woody plant species comprising
   1,208 individual plants (59\% trees and 41\% shrubs) were recorded
   across the three fire frequency strata. Our results showed significant
   differences (P < 0.05) in woody plant height with the low fire frequency
   stratum having the tallest woody plants whereas the high fire frequency
   stratum had the shortest woody plants. Tree density was highest in the
   medium fire frequency stratum and lowest in high fire frequency stratum
   whilst shrub density was highest in the low fire frequency stratum and
   lowest in the high fire frequency stratum (both, P < 0.05). In contrast,
   no significant differences (P > 0.05) were recorded for woody plant
   evenness and species diversity across the three fire frequency strata.
   We recommend for the development of a robust fire management plan for

Abstract = {{National fuel-reduction programs aim to reduce the risk of wildland
   fires to human communities and to restore forest and rangeland
   ecosystems to resemble their historical structure, function, and
   diversity. There are a number of factors, such as seed bank dynamics,
   post-treatment climate, and herbivory, which determine whether this
   latter goal may be achieved. Here, we examine the short-term (2 years)
   vegetation response to fuel-reduction treatments (mechanical
   mastication, broadcast burn, and pile burn) and seeding of native
   grasses on understory vegetation in an upland pion-juniper woodland in
   southeast Utah. We also examine how wildlife herbivory affects the
   success of fuel-reduction treatments. Herbaceous cover increased in
   response to fuel-reduction treatments in all seeded treatments, with the
   broadcast burn and mastication having greater increases (234 and 160 \%,
   respectively) in herbaceous cover than the pile burn (32 \%). In the
   absence of seeding, herbaceous cover only increased in the broadcast
   burn (32 \%). Notably, fuel-reduction treatments, but not seeding,
   strongly affected herbaceous plant composition. All fuel-reduction
   treatments increased the relative density of invasive species,
   especially in the broadcast burn, which shifted the plant community
   composition from one dominated by perennial graminoids to one dominated
   by annual forbs. Herbivory by wildlife reduced understory plant cover by
   over 40 \% and altered plant community composition. If the primary
   management goal is to enhance understory cover while promoting native
   species abundance, our study suggests that mastication may be the most
   effective treatment strategy in these upland pion-juniper woodlands.
   Seed applications and wildlife exclosures further enhanced herbaceous
   cover following fuel-reduction treatments.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3593-3607}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires in Mediterranean Europe have been increasing in number and
   extension over the last decades and constitute one of the major
   disturbances of these ecosystems. Portugal is the country with more
   burnt area in the last decade and the years of 2003 and 2005 were
   particularly devastating, the total burned areas of 425 000 and 338 000
   ha being several times higher than the corresponding average. The year
   of 2005 further coincided with one of the most severe droughts since
   early 20th century. Due to different responses of vegetation to diverse
   fire regimes and to the complexity of landscape structures, fires have
   complex effects on vegetation recovery. Remote sensing has revealed to
   be a powerful tool in studying vegetation dynamics and in monitoring
   post-fire vegetation recovery, which is crucial to land-management and
   to prevent erosion.
   The main goals of the present work are (i) to assess the accuracy of a
   vegetation recovery model previously developed by the authors; (ii) to
   assess the model's performance, namely its sensitivity to initial
   conditions, to the temporal length of the input dataset and to missing
   data; (iii) to study vegetation recovery over two selected areas that
   were affected by two large wildfire events in the fire seasons of 2003
   and 2005, respectively.
   The study relies on monthly values of NDVI over 11 years (1998-2009), at
   1 kmx1 km spatial resolution, as obtained by the VEGETATION instrument.
   According to results from sensitivity analysis, the model is robust and
   able to provide good estimations of recovery times of vegetation when
   the regeneration process is regular, even when missing data is present.
   In respect to the two selected burnt scars, results indicate that fire
   damage is a determinant factor of regeneration, as less damaged
   vegetation recovers more rapidly, which is mainly justified by the high
   coverage of Pinus pinaster over the area, and by the fact that
   coniferous forests tend to recover slower than transitional
   woodland-shrub, which tend to dominate the areas following the fire
   event.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forests store 30\% of the world's terrestrial carbon (C).
   Consequently, climate change mediated alterations in the boreal forest
   fire regime can have a significant impact on the global C budget. Here
   we synthesize the effects of forest fires on the stocks and recovery
   rates of C in boreal forests using 368 plots from 16 long-term (>= 100
   year) fire chronosequences distributed throughout the boreal zone.
   Forest fires led to a decrease in total C stocks (excluding mineral
   soil) by an average of 60\% (range from 80\%), which was primarily a
   result of C stock declines in the living trees and soil organic layer.
   Total C stocks increased with time since fire largely following a
   sigmoidal shape Gompertz function, with an average asymptote of 8.1 kg C
   m(-2). Total C stocks accumulated at a rate of 2-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)during
   the first 100 years. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) was identified
   as a significant driver of C stocks and their post-fire recovery, likely
   because it integrates temperature, radiation, and the length of the
   growing season. If the fire return interval shortens to <= 100 years in
   the future, our findings indicate that many boreal forests will be
   prevented from reaching their full C storage potential. However, our
   results also suggest that climate warming-induced increases in PET may
   speed up the post-fire recovery of C stocks.}},

Abstract = {{Fire profoundly modifies the terrestrial C cycle of about 40\% of the
   Earth's land surface. The immediate effect of fire is that of a net loss
   of C as CO2 gas and soot particles to the atmosphere. Nevertheless, a
   proportion of the ecosystem biomass is converted into charcoal, which
   contains highly recalcitrant molecular structures that contribute to
   long-term C storage. The present study aimed to assess simultaneously
   losses to the atmosphere and charcoal production rates of C and N
   compounds as a result of prescription fire in a Florida scrub-oak
   ecosystem. Pre-fire and post-fire charred and unburned organic matter
   stocks were determined for vegetation leaves and stems, litter and soil
   in 20 sub-plots installed in a 30-ha area that was subjected to
   prescribed fire. Concentrations of C and N were determined, and fluxes
   among pools and to the atmosphere were derived from these measurements.
   Soil C and N stocks were unchanged by the fire. Post-fire standing dead
   biomass contained 30\% and 12\% of pre-fire vegetation C and N stocks,
   respectively. In litter, post-fire stocks contained 64\% and 83\% of
   pre-fire C and N stocks, respectively. Most of the difference in
   relative losses between vegetation and litter could be attributed to
   substantial litter fall of charred and unburned leaves during the fire
   event. Indeed, an estimated 21\% of pre-fire vegetation leaf C was found
   in the post-fire litter, while the remaining 79\% was lost to the
   atmosphere. About 3/4 of the fire-induced leaf litter fall was in the
   form of unburned tissue and the remainder was charcoal, which amounted
   to 5\% of pre-fire leaf C stocks. Charcoal production ranged between 4\%
   and 6\% of the fire-affected biomass, i.e. the sum of charcoal
   production and atmospheric losses. This value is below the range of
   literature values for the transformation of plant tissue into stable
   soil organic matter through humification processes, which suggests that
   fire generates a smaller quantity of stable organic C than humification
   processes over decades and potentially centuries.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem response to disturbance is influenced by environmental
   conditions at a number of scales. Changes in climate have altered fire
   regimes across the western United States, and have also likely altered
   spatio-temporal patterns of post-fire vegetation regeneration. Fire
   occurrence data and a vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the NOAA
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used to monitor
   post-fire vegetation from 1989 to 2007. We first investigated
   differences in post-fire rates of vegetation regeneration between
   ecoregions. We then related precipitation, temperature, and elevation
   records at four temporal scales to rates of post-fire vegetation
   regeneration to ascertain the influence of climate on post-fire
   vegetation dynamics. We found that broad-scale climate factors are an
   important influence on post-fire vegetation regeneration. Most notably,
   higher rates of post-fire regeneration occurred with warmer minimum
   temperatures. Increases in precipitation also resulted in higher rates
   of post-fire vegetation growth. While explanatory power was slight,
   multiple statistical approaches provided evidence for real ecological
   drivers of post-fire regeneration that should be investigated further at
   finer scales. The sensitivity of post-disturbance vegetation dynamics to
   climatic drivers has important ramifications for the management of
   ecosystems under changing climatic conditions. Shifts in temperature and
   precipitation regimes are likely to result in changes in
   post-disturbance dynamics, which could represent important feedbacks

Abstract = {{Forest fires are one of the most important causes of environmental
   alteration in Mediterranean countries. Discrimination of different
   degrees of burn severity is critical for improving management of
   fire-affected areas. This paper aims to evaluate the usefulness of land
   surface temperature (LST) as potential indicator of burn severity. We
   used a large convention-dominated wildfire, which occurred on 19-21
   September, 2012 in Northwestern Spain. From this area, a 1-year series
   of six LST images were generated from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper
   (ETM+) data using a single channel algorithm. Further, the Composite
   Burn Index (CBI) was measured in 111 field plots to identify the burn
   severity level (low, moderate, and high). Evaluation of the potential
   relationship between post-fire LST and ground measured CBI was performed
   by both correlation analysis and regression models. Correlation
   coefficients were higher in the immediate post-fire LST images, but
   decreased during the fall of 2012 and increased again with a second
   maximum value in summer, 2013. A linear regression model between
   post-fire LST and CBI allowed us to represent spatially predicted CBI
   (R-squared(adj) >85\%). After performing an analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   between post-fire LST and CBI, a Fisher's least significant difference
   test determined that two burn severity levels (low-moderate and high)
   could be statistically distinguished. The identification of such burn
   severity levels is sufficient and useful to forest managers. We conclude
   that summer post-fire LST from moderate resolution satellite data may be
   considered as a valuable indicator of burn severity for large fires in
   Mediterranean forest ecosytems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To forestall loss of ecological values associated with forests, land
   managers need to consider where and when to prioritize active
   reforestation following major disturbance events. To aid this
   decision-making process, we summarize recent research findings
   pertaining to the Sierra Nevada region of California, USA to identify
   contexts in which active reforestation or passive recovery may best
   promote desirable post-fire ecological trajectories. Based on our
   synthesis, we suggest conceptual frameworks for assessing landscape
   conditions and determining areas that may be the highest priorities for
   tree planting to avoid persistent loss of conifer forests. Field studies
   have shown that some large patches of high severity burn can have
   relatively low levels of natural regeneration, especially among desired
   pine species. The accumulation of fuels and competition with shrubs and
   resprouting hardwoods may hinder the reestablishment of mature conifer
   trees. However, severe fires could also play a restorative role, by
   promoting non-conifer forested communities, such as meadows,
   shrubfields, and open forests with significant hardwood components. Such
   communities were historically rejuvenated and maintained by fire but
   have been replaced by conifer forest due in part to fire suppression.
   Reforestation in such areas may run counter to restoring ecological
   function and the ecosystem services that are provided by non-conifer
   communities. Through this framework, managers and stakeholders may
   better understand the contexts in which planting and passive recovery
   may better support ecological restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Transpiration and stomatal conductance in deciduous needleleaf boreal
   forests of northern Siberia can be highly sensitive to water stress,
   permafrost thaw, and atmospheric dryness. Additionally, north-eastern
   Siberian boreal forests are fire-driven, and larch (Larix spp.) are the
   sole tree species. We examined differences in tree water use, stand
   characteristics, and stomatal responses to environmental drivers between
   high and low tree density stands that burned 76 years ago in
   north-eastern Siberia. Our results provide process-level insight to
   climate feedbacks related to boreal forest productivity, water cycles,
   and permafrost across Arctic regions. The high density stand had
   shallower permafrost thaw depths and deeper moss layers than the low
   density stand. Rooting depths and shallow root biomass were similar
   between stands. Daily transpiration was higher on average in the
   high-density stand 0.12 L m(-2) day(-1) (SE: 0.004) compared with the
   low density stand 0.10 L m(-2) day(-1) (SE: 0.001) throughout the

   at both stands during the dry period in 2017 in both stands of 0.10 L

   responses to environmental drivers, and the high density stand was more
   dependent on antecedent precipitation that occurred over longer periods
   in the past compared with the low density stand. Post-fire tree density
   differences in plant-water relations may lead to different trajectories

Abstract = {{Although post-fire soil erosion has been studied, little attention has
   been paid to changes in soil surface cover following fires, despite this
   being a key factor in understanding the water and sediment yield. This
   study, at Penaflor (Spain), investigated the effect of fire on soil
   erosion using data from soil erosion plots and high spatial resolution
   photography (HSRP). Measurements were made from October 2003 to October
   2005 in a control plot and a plot experimentally exposed to a fire in
   October 2004. Ground cover components were identified, including
   vegetation, bare soil, stones, charcoal and ash. Runoff and sediment
   concentrations were low because of the absence of intense rainfall
   events, but the fire contributed to an increase of soil erosion by one
   order of magnitude. HSRP observations demonstrated that the sediments
   become mixed with ash and charcoal. Disappearance of the ash two months
   after the fire and a reduction in the amount of surface charcoal showed
   that these factors control erosion during the first few rainfall events
   following a fire. An increase in rock fragment cover was a consequence
   of the removal of vegetation and litter by the fire, and removal of the
   ash and charcoal by overland flow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Although wildfires are occurring frequently in the pine-oak forests in
   the Sierra Madre Oriental (northeastern Mexico), data on post-fire
   succession and forest structure are still rare. Our objectives were to
   (1) assess the changes in woody plant species composition after fire and
   to (2) to relate successional patterns to environmental variability.
   Based on their fire history 23 plots were selected in the Parque
   Ecologico, Chipinque (PECH). Changes in forest structure across the
   chronosequence of turned stands were deduced from density, height and
   diameter measurements of trees and shrubs (>5 cm in diameter) in all
   plots Of 1000 m(2). Differences in woody plant species composition among
   the plots were evaluated using Shannon evenness measure and the
   Whittaker's measure and by Hierarchical cluster analysis and Detrended
   Correspondence Analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a high
   similarity among all recently burned plots, indepencled of the aspect.
   Multivariate analysis showed that local environmental factors, including
   time since fire, continue to structure species composition. Oak species
   (mainly Quercus rysophylla) resprouted successfully after fire and
   dominated young post-fire stands. Pine species (Pinus pseudotrobus and
   Pinus teocote) only appeared 18 years after fire and were the dominating
   species in mature stands (62 years after fire). In contrast, woody plant
   species composition in older stands tended also to be influenced by
   factors such as aspect and by the potential solar radiation (PSR) during
   the growing season. The results demonstrate that in the PECH, natural
   regeneration is sufficient and woody plant species composition will be
   similar to pre-fire conditions after 60 years of succession. We conclude
   that the park managers should consider incorporating natural disturbance
   regimes into their management practices.(C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Widespread climate change is expected to lead to altered patterns of
   disturbance, thereby driving future ecosystem change. This interaction,
   which is often poorly recognized or understood, may be particularly
   important in the sub-arctic due to rapid climate change and frequent
   fire. Our objective was to investigate how an altered fire return
   interval can interrupt successional pathways in a serotinous boreal
   ecosystem. We conducted this research in black spruce (Picea mariana
   {[}Mill.] BSP.) forests on the northern margin of the species'
   distribution in Yukon Territory, Canada. We compared seed availability
   and seedling establishment of black spruce in stands of varying fire
   return interval using experimental manipulations within areas varying in
   their natural fire histories. Recruitment was drastically reduced
   following two closely timed fires, compared to stands burned under a
   typical fire return interval. However, recruitment was also limited in
   mature forest stands. On-site germination experiments demonstrated that
   black spruce recruitment was limited by seed availability after a short
   fire return interval, and by substrate quality in unburned stands. The
   vegetation of the boreal forest is thought to be highly resilient to
   climatic change, due in part to the adaptations that conifers have for
   post-fire regeneration. We show that shortened fire return intervals,
   through effects on seed availability, disrupt the normal sequence of
   post-fire recovery on seedbeds released by fire for colonisation. The
   results of this study provide strong empirical evidence that
   disturbance, although essential for stand renewal, may limit forest
   recovery or expansion when misaligned with reproductive cycles. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Questions: How does the time interval between subsequent stand-replacing
   fire events affect post-fire understorey cover and composition following
   the recent event? How important is fire interval relative to broad- or
   local-scale environmental variability in structuring post-fire
   understorey communities?
   Location: Subalpine plateaus of Yellowstone National Park (USA) that
   burned in 1988.
   Methods: In 2000, we sampled understorey cover and Pinus contorta
   density in pairs of 12-yr old stands at 25 locations. In each pair, the
   previous fire interval was either short (7-100 yr) or long (100-395 yr).
   We analysed variation in understorey species richness, total cover, and
   cover of functional groups both between site pairs (using paired
   t-tests) and across sites that experienced the short fire intervals
   (using regression and ordination). We regressed three principal
   components to assess the relative importance of disturbance and broad or
   local environmental variability on post-fire understorey cover and
   richness.
   Results: Between paired plots, annuals were less abundant and
   fire-intolerant species (mostly slow-growing shrubs) were more abundant
   following long intervals between prior fires. However, mean total cover
   and richness did not vary between paired interval classes. Across a
   gradient of fire intervals ranging from 7-100 yr, total cover, species
   richness, and the cover of annuals and nitrogen-fixing species all
   declined while the abundance of shrubs and fire-intolerant species
   increased. The few exotics showed no response to fire interval. Across
   all sites, broad-scale variability related to elevation influenced total
   cover and richness more than fire interval.
   Conclusions: Significant variation in fire intervals had only minor
   effects on post-fire understorey communities following the 1988 fires in

   soil, burnt control soil, burnt soil with rye seeding and burnt soil
   with straw mulch. For the different soil treatments, the sediments

   the soil properties analyzed but reduced significantly the sediments
   yield compared to that of the control burnt soil. The mean efficiency of

Abstract = {{Human-altered ecological disturbances may challenge system resilience
   and disrupt biological legacies maintaining ecosystem recovery. Yet, the
   extent to which novel regimes challenge these legacies varies. This may
   be partially explained by differences in the vulnerability of life
   history strategies to disturbance characteristics. In the fire-prone,
   resprouter-dominated coast redwood forests of California, the introduced
   disease sudden oak death (SOD) alters fuel profiles, fire behavior, and
   aboveground tree mortality; however, this system is dominated by
   resprouting trees that are well-adapted to aboveground damage, and
   belowground survival of individuals may represent the principal
   biological legacy connecting pre- and post-fire communities. Much of the
   research exploring altered disturbances and forest recovery has focused
   on legacies determined by seed dispersal and aboveground survival of
   adults. In this work, we use pre- and post-fire data from a long-term
   monitoring network to assess the impacts of novel disturbance
   interactions between wildfire and SOD on the belowground survival and
   vegetative reproduction of resprouters. We found that increasing
   accumulation of coarse woody surface fuels from SOD-killed hosts
   decreased the likelihood of belowground survival for resprouting tanoak
   trees, but not for redwoods. Tanoaks' belowground survival was
   negatively related to substrate burn severity, which increased with the
   volume of surface fuels from hosts, suggesting heat damage as a possible
   mechanism influencing altered patterns of resprouter mortality. These
   impacts increased with decreasing tree size. By contrast, redwood and
   tanoak trees that survived both disturbances resprouted more vigorously,
   regardless of post-fire infection by P.ramorum, and generated similar
   recruitment at the stand level. Our results demonstrate that
   disease-fire interactions can narrow recruitment filters for
   resprouters, which could impact long-term population and demographic
   structure; yet, compounded disturbance may also reduce stand density and
   disease pressure, allowing competitive release of survivors. Resprouters
   displayed vulnerabilities to altered disturbance, but our research
   suggests that legacies maintained by resprouting may be more resilient
   to certain compounded disturbances, compared to seed-obligate species,
   because of high rates of individual survival under increasingly severe
   events. These trends have important implications for conservation of
   declining tree species in SOD-impacted forests, as well as predictions
   of human impacts in other disturbance-prone systems where resprouters
   are present.}},

   Fire severity classes, defined by basal area mortality, were mapped on
   three burned sites (29-197 ha). Variation in fire severity contributed
   to a landscape mosaic of patches with varying size, shape, forest stand
   structure, and tree species' composition. Post-fire tree regeneration
   was numerically dominated by red fir in all fire severity classes, but
   seedling establishment and growth varied among severity classes. Density
   of red fir seedlings was highest in low- and moderate-severity patches,
   and lower in high-severity patches and unburned areas. Height growth of
   red fir seedlings increases with fire severity.
   Variations in fire severity in red fir forests appear to be a major
   influence on post-fire stand structure and species composition,

Abstract = {{In 1989 a wildfire destroyed 300 ha of natural pine forest and
   Mediterranean woodland on Mt. Carmel, Israel. Consequently an
   interdisciplinary scientific effort in fire ecology was initiated in
   order to propose recommendations to the management authorities, Field
   data gathered on soil erosion in the Mt. Carmel site implied that
   erosion is severe only during the first winter after fire, but it does
   not seem to present a significant threat to longterm ecosystem recovery.
   The recovery of the natural vegetation mitigates erosion, and there is
   no special need for any precautions to be taken immediatly following
   fire. Salvage cutting of burned trees had no effect on pine seedling
   recruitment, on vegetation development and on plant species diversity.
   Salvage cutting did affect passerine bird community by slowing down
   succession rate. For successful regeneration of the pine forest the
   burned site need not to be planted, since the number of natural pine
   seedlings is sufficiently great, and there is a need to conserve the
   genetic and spatial variability of the forest. Although thinning has a
   positive effect on short-term pine survival and growth, such action is
   not recommended since pine seedlings are susceptible to pine bast scale
   (Matsococcus josephi) up to seven years, and to severe damage by
   porcupines. Selection caused by this bast scale might improve the
   resistance of the new pine forest stand. Pine seedling growing in
   the:microsites of the old burned pine trees should be treated carefully,
   since some of them, due to their fast development, appear to be the next
   generation of the forest. Thinning of these groups can be considered
   after seven years, accompanied by removal of Cistus dwarf shrubs.
   However, where porcupine damage is observed, thinning should be done at
   low rates and with no pruning of side twigs. Since animal succession is
   a consequence of the change and progress in vegetation structure, there
   is no need for animal resettlement. The concept of ``fuel breaks{''},
   combining a single massive thinning of the woody vegetation and an
   annual short but heavy grazing, is a management option for decreasing
   fire danger and future fire damage.}},

Abstract = {{Question: The importance of silvicultural site preparation techniques in

   the effects of mechanical site preparation (MSP) on post-fire vegetation
   regeneration within reforested sites in Mediterranean Israel.
   Location: Upper Galilee region, Israel.
   Methods: Vegetation cover and composition, ruderal species colonization
   and pine regeneration were monitored in four reforested sites for 3yr
   following wildland fires that burned mature Pinus brutia and
   P.halepensis plantations. In each reforested site, a 50mx50m monitoring
   area was assigned and measurements were conducted within five subplots
   (2mx50m) encompassing three MSP patch types: ploughed patches (P),
   unploughed patches (UP) and planting mounds (M) that combined ploughing,
   pit digging and wood-chip mulching.
   Results: Recovery of vegetation cover (excluding pines) was rapid. The
   MSP patch type significantly affected vegetation cover in the first
   spring following the fire: cover was lowest on M, intermediate on P and
   highest on UP. However, these differences became minor by the third
   spring following the fire. Total woody species richness was not affected
   by MSP patch type, although there were minor effects on relative
   abundance of woody species. Two ruderal species were found, but their
   abundance became untraceable by the third year. Patterns of MSP effects
   on pine regeneration were similar for P.halepensis and P.brutia. Density
   of emerging seedlings of both pine species during the first year
   following the fire was significantly affected by MSP patch type: lower
   in P and M than in UP by more than 50\% and 90\%, respectively. However,
   emergence and/or survival during the following 2yr was higher in P and M
   than in UP, with overall outcome of pine regeneration still about 50\%
   lower in P and M than in UP.
   Conclusions: The MSP treatments had only a minor, short-term effect on
   post-fire regeneration and colonization of vegetation, except for pine
   recruitment, which was more severely affected.}},

Abstract = {{Question and Location: How does soil burn severity and early post-fire
   tree composition affect long-term understorey vegetation dynamics in the
   coniferous forests of eastern Canada?
   Method: Vegetation dynamics were assessed using palcoecological methods
   and a chronosequence analysis of extant stands. The relation between
   environmental factors and succession was evaluated using ordination
   techniques on the chronosequence data. Understorey succession was
   studied by regression analysis on the chronosequence data and through
   within-site Markovian transition probabilities between successive 1-cm
   layers of plant macroremains from soil organic matter profiles.
   Results: Initial tree composition (Picea mariana and Pinus banksiana)
   had little effect on understorey composition. Soil burn severity
   (measured as the thickness of the residual forest floor humus)
   significantly affected temporal changes in understorey species.
   Following fires of high severity, stands underwent a gradual
   paludification with a net increase in Sphagnum and ericaceous shrubs
   (Ledum groenlandicum), and a decrease in feathermosses. Paludification
   was accelerated after low severity fires, which led to the dominance of
   Sphagnum less than 200 years after fire, and of L. groenlandicum shortly
   after fire. In situ paleo-ecological work confirmed results obtained
   with the chronosequence analysis.
   Conclusions: One vegetation gradient related to time after disturbance
   is insufficient to account for the full complexity of long-term changes
   in understorey composition following fire. Current forestry practices
   that protect the forest floor humus may induce a premature
   paludification.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize life history strategies of Florida scrub plants in
   relation to fire, we classified 98 species into guilds based on recovery
   mechanisms and post-fire abundance patterns. Two types of scrub were
   analyzed: xeric, infrequently-burned rosemary scrub and more productive,
   more-frequently burned scrubby flatwoods. Based on recovery mechanisms,
   most (92\%) species are in four guilds: resprouters (mainly woody
   shrubs), resprouters and seeders (small-statured shrubs, palms, and
   herbaceous perennials), obligate seeders (mainly herbs), and resprouters
   and clonal spreaders. The last category contains most of the dominant
   shrubs of scrubby flatwoods. Two pine species each comprised a unique
   guild based on recovery mechanisms.
   Most species of scrubby flatwoods (59\%) and rosemary scrub (53\%) had
   no significant trend in post-fire abundance. About twice as many scrubby
   flatwoods species increased as decreased in frequency with time since
   fire; increasers included ground lichens and two of the three dominant
   oaks. Similar numbers of species increased and decreased in rosemary
   scrub. Most increasers were ground lichens and most decreasers were
   herbaceous perennials. In scrubby flatwoods, most plants with vegetative
   recovery modes tended to increase in frequency with time since fire,
   mixed recovery mode plants usually had no trend, and obligate seeders
   decreased. In rosemary scrub, mixed recovery modes were associated with
   decreasing post-fire trends, while seeders tended to increase in
   post-fire abundance. Infrequently-burned rosemary scrub provides
   opportunities for seedling recovery from fire, evident in both in its
   dominant species and in the many endemic and open-space specialist
   herbs. In contrast, recovery from fire by resprouting and clonal growth
   is common in the more-frequently burned scrubby flatwoods, promoting
   rapid post-fire recovery and long-term competitive superiority in this
   more productive habitat.
   To promote life history and species diversity, fire management in
   Florida scrub should avoid overly regular fire regimes, fire suppression
   or too-frequent burning. Modal intervals will differ between scrubby
   flatwoods (520 years) and rosemary scrub(15-40 years). When to reburn
   rosemary scrub may depend on the specific responses of its many endemic
   plant species to fire.}},

Abstract = {{Remotely sensed data have already become one of the major resources for
   estimating the burn severity of forest fires. Recently, Land Surface
   Temperature (LST) calculated from remote sensing data has been
   considered as a potential indicator for estimating burn severity.
   However, using the LET-based index alone may not be sufficient for
   estimating burn severity in the areas that has unburned trees and

   and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) together. The accuracy of the
   proposed index was evaluated by using 264 composite burn index (CBI)
   field sample data of the five fires across different regional eco-type
   areas in the Western United States. Results show that the proposed index
   performed equally well for post-fire areas covered with both sparse
   vegetation and dense vegetation and relatively better than some
   commonly-used burn severity indices. This index also has high potential
   of estimating burn severity if more accurate surface temperatures can be
   obtained in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many arid zones around the word, the vegetation spontaneously forms

   irreversible shift of delicate ecosystems as a consequence of minor
   variation of the climatic forcing has been studied extensively in the
   past. The attitude of the ecosystem to recover after a catastrophic
   event, such as fire, did not receive as much attention so far. Here we
   modelled fire, as a sudden shift of the ecosystem state variables and
   functionality and evaluated post-fire scenarios under the hypothesis
   that two major feedbacks shaped the vegetation patterns: a positive
   feedback between preferential infiltration and plant growth, and a
   second feedback between infiltration and vegetation burning. A simple
   model solving a set of partial differential equations for soil moisture,
   plant biomass, surface water and dead biomass balance predicted
   significantly diverse post-fire vegetation patterns depending on the

Abstract = {{The native tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, synchronizes its germination
   with the immediate post-fire environment with a combination of
   germination stimulants found in wood smoke and inhibitors from the
   unburned litter of the dominant vegetation. The inhibitors override the
   stimulants and prevent seeds from germinating maladaptively in unburned
   habitats adjacent to burns. To understand the physiological basis of
   this environmental control of germination, we tested several previously
   isolated signals, phytohormones and their respective biosynthesis
   inhibitors. The germination inhibitors methyl jasmonate (MeJA, a
   constituent of sagebrush litter), bornane-2,5-dione (BD, a constituent
   of juniper litter extract, JLE) and JLE did not alter abscisic acid
   (ABA) content of imbibed seeds. Treatment with the ABA biosynthesis
   inhibitor, fluridone, inhibited the dormancy-inducing effects of BD, JLE
   and MeJA, but surprisingly did not affect endogenous ABA levels in
   treated seeds. However, ABA leached from litter of the species, which
   dominate the plant community before fires, plays an important role in
   germination control. We conclude that N. attenuata seeds, which can lie
   dormant in the soil for 150 years between fires, time their germination
   with the post-fire environment by responding to smoke, ABA and four

Abstract = {{Questions: We investigated the effects of human-induced fires on woody
   plant components of dry deciduous forest in Madagascar. Specifically, we
   addressed the following questions: (1) which forest layers are most
   affected by fire; (2) how is forest structure, species richness,
   diversity and composition affected by fire disturbance; and (3) does the
   forest recover after fire disturbance?
   Location: Kirindy Forest in Central Menabe, western Madagascar.
   Methods: We conducted our investigations in seven areas of the Kirindy
   Forest, which was burned between 1984 and 2009. Vegetation data were
   collected in nested plots for the different forest layers in the burned
   and unburned forest. Using GLM, we assessed fire impact on forest
   structure, species richness and diversity of the different forest
   layers. The recovery of burned forest was investigated using correlation
   analysis. In addition, we used descriptive methods to analyse fire
   impact on species composition.
   Results: Fire mainly influenced the middle forest layers, trees >1.50-m
   high and diameters <15cm, and significantly reduced tree density, basal
   area, species richness and diversity. Fire had no significant impact on
   the measured parameters of the shrub and top layers. Despite the severe
   impact of fire on the middle forest layers, most of the measured
   parameters of these layers were able to recover from fire disturbance
   within a short time. Twelve years after fire disturbance, tree density,
   basal area, species richness and diversity in burned forest areas no
   longer differed from unburned forest areas. However, species composition
   differed substantially between burned and unburned forests.
   Conclusions: We conclude that fire severely impacts the middle forest
   layers and alters forest structure, i.e. species richness and tree
   diversity, of the dry deciduous forest of Central Menabe.}},

Title = {{Asynchronous forest-stream coupling in a fire-prone boreal landscape:
   insights from woody debris}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{789-801}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. We used dendrochronology to reconstruct the transfer of coarse woody
   debris across a forest-stream interface in a fire-prone boreal
   landscape. A sequence of regulating factors was considered from source
   to sink of in-stream woody debris (SWD), including fire history at the
   landscape scale, patterns of post-fire recovery of riparian forest and
   inputs of SWD at the scale of a stream reach and its associated
   floodplain, and burial of SWD at an excavated site.
   2. Fires occurred repeatedly in the studied landscape (at least in 1708,
   1733, 1791, 1811, c. 1838, c. 1850, 1882, 1941 and 1998), and were
   generally patchy on the floodplain because of the firebreak effect of
   the riparian corridor. Unburned forest remnants were regularly generated
   at the stream margin, thus permitting temporally continuous but
   spatially localized transfer of woody material across the forest-stream
   interface. These remaining forest patches also increased forest
   resilience by dispersing seeds and promoting conifer re-establishment in
   burned areas.
   3. Because of higher severity compared with previous fires, the 1941
   fire burned almost everywhere on the floodplain, creating only a few
   widely isolated unburned forest remnants. Consequently, following an
   abrupt post-fire increase, SWD inputs almost completely ceased. In
   addition, post-fire recovery of the riparian wood source is slow because
   of the spatially restricted seed source.
   4. In this alluvial stream, wood burial is faster than decay and largely
   determines the residence time of SWD. Because the residence time is
   about 150 years, the current density of SWD is high and contrasts
   sharply with the very low tree density at the stream margin. Although
   this long residence time helps maintain stream integrity while the
   forest is recovering from the 1941 fire, it is unlikely that SWD inputs
   would resume extensively before burial of the current SWD pool.
   5. Our research exemplifies the potentially complex impacts of
   disturbances on material transfer between a source and a sink ecosystem.
   We conclude that when certain components of ecosystems are coupled by
   unidirectional flow, those components will behave asynchronously if a
   disturbance impact at the source ecosystem does not propagate rapidly to
   the sink and the source and the sink recover at different rates.}},

Abstract = {{Fire-generated mosaics of habitat legacies such as dead and dying trees
   are key structural components in boreal forest ecosystems that support
   diverse saproxylic beetles. Our study sought to elucidate the spatial
   pattern of community composition (beta diversity) of saproxylic beetles
   along gradients of post-fire habitat legacies (tree species composition,
   tree size {[}dbh], and burn severities) and geographical distance. For 2
   y, we reared saproxylic beetles from 360 logs retrieved from 72 sites in
   burned forests. Tests were performed to explain the overall beta
   diversity (beta(sor)) by partitioning it into its 2 components: the
   ``species spatial turnover{''} due to species replacement (beta(sim))
   and the ``richness-driven{''} beta diversity due to species richness
   differences (beta(rich)). Variations in tree species, tree size, and
   burn severity had significant effects on overall beta diversity
   (beta(sor)) of saproxylic beetles; these effects varied according to the
   differential influence of these factors on the 2 distinct components of
   beta diversity. Tree composition had notable effects on species spatial
   turnover (beta(sim)), for which saproxylic species composition differed
   between jack pine and black spruce, and it was more variable between
   jack pine sites than between black spruce sites. On the other hand,
   variation in tree size was primarily responsible for the richness-driven
   beta diversity component (beta(rich)), which was highest between the
   smallest and largest dbh groups and lowest between largest and mid-sized
   trees. Similarly, richness-driven composition differed significantly
   across severity gradients and was highest across low to high severity
   and lowest between low-severity stands. Broader geographical distance
   per se did not affect compositional patterns of saproxylic beetles, yet
   the landscape context could have some effect. These results could have
   crucial implications for post-fire management, which also aims to
   efficiently conserve saproxylic beetles. The significant spatial
   turnover in saproxylic composition between black spruce and jack pine
   and the underlying host-tree specificity suggest that a mosaic of both
   tree species should be maintained in the landscape. The richness-driven
   beta diversity pattern along the tree size and severity gradients
   implies that it may be necessary to prioritize the most species-rich
   classes, such as larger trees with lower severity burns, but with
   qualifications to cater also for species displaying idiosyncratic
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important natural disturbance in western North American

   Salvage-logged areas were not used by snowshoe hares. Red squirrel

   removed live canopy trees required by both snowshoe hares and red

Abstract = {{Forest harvesting strategies that approximate natural disturbances have

   richness in the boreal forests of North America. Natural disturbances
   impact shoreline forests and upland areas at similar rates. However,
   shoreline forests are generally protected from harvest through the
   retention of treed buffer strips. We examined bird community responses
   to forest management guidelines intended to approximate shoreline forest
   fires by comparing bird community structure in early (1-4 years)
   post-burned and harvested boreal riparian habitats and the adjacent
   shoreline forest. We sampled riparian areas with adjacent: (1) burned
   merchantable shoreline forest (n = 21), (2) burned non-merchantable
   shoreline forest (n = 29), (3) 10 m treed buffer with 25\% retention in
   the next 30 rn (n = 18), and (4) 30 m treed buffer (n = 21). Only minor
   differences were detected in riparian species' abundance and bird
   community composition between treatments with greater differences in
   these parameters occurring between post-fire and post-harvest upland
   bird communities. Indicators of all merchantable treatments were
   dominated by upland species with open-habitat species and habitat
   generalists being typical upland indicator species of burned
   merchantable habitats and forest specialists typical upland indicators
   of harvested treatments. Riparian species indicative of burned riparian
   habitats were Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Le Conte's
   Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus)
   and indicators of 30 m buffers were Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum)
   and Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla). Multivariate Redundancy
   Analysis (RDA) of the overall (riparian and upland birds) community
   showed greater divergence than RDA with only riparian species suggesting
   less effect of fire and forestry on riparian birds than on upland birds.
   Higher natural range of variability (NRV) of overall post-fire bird
   communities compared to post-harvest communities emphasizes that
   harvesting guidelines currently do not achieve this level of

Abstract = {{Devastating wildfires in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas in 2016 and 2017
   resulted in significant social, economic, and environmental losses, with
   the agricultural sector among those severely affected. Several
   satellite-based indices were evaluated as potential monitoring tools for
   post-wildfire ecological recovery and management of grasslands. All
   indices evaluated provided useful information and indicated rapid
   vegetation recovery from wildfire. The Leaf Water Stress Index (LSWI)
   and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) showed a distinct response to the
   wildfire events, and differentiated between burned and unburned areas
   throughout the post-wildfire growing seasons better than the Normalized
   Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI).
   In particular, the LSWI may provide a useful tool for mapping the
   footprint of wildfire, with potential utility for organizations that
   provide post-fire recovery resources. The GPP, which estimates the
   biomass productivity of vegetation, can provide information to livestock
   operators to guide the re-stocking of cattle in the aftermath of
   wildfire. In sum, satellite-based proxies can provide timely information
   both to characterize a wildfire's footprint and to guide post-fire
   grazing management in a manner that balances short term needs for forage
   with long-term productivity and ecological function.}},

Abstract = {{Antelope bitterbrush is a dominant shrub in many interior ponderosa pine
   forests in the western United States. How it responds to prescribed fire
   is not well understood, yet is of considerable concern to wildlife and
   fire managers alike given its importance as a browse species and as a
   ladder fuel in these fire-prone forests. We quantified bitterbrush
   cover, density, and biomass in response to repeated burning in thinned
   ponderosa pine forests. Low- to moderate-intensity spring burning killed
   the majority of bitterbrush plants on replicate plots. Moderately rapid
   recovery of bitterbrush density and cover resulted from seedling
   recruitment plus limited basal sprouting. Repeated burning after I I
   years impeded the recovery of the bitterbrush community. Post-fire seed
   germination following the repeated burns was 3-14-fold lower compared to
   the germination rate after the initial burns, while basal sprouting
   remained fairly minor. After 15 years, bitterbrush cover was 75-92\%
   lower on repeated-burned compared to unburned plots. Only where
   localized tree mortality resulted in an open stand was bitterbrush
   recovery robust. By controlling bitterbrush abundance, repeated burning
   eliminated the potential for wildfire spread when simulated using a
   customized fire behavior model. The results suggest that repeated
   burning is a successful method to reduce the long-term fire risk imposed
   by bitterbrush as an understory ladder fuel in thinned pine stands.
   Balancing the need to limit fire risk yet provide adequate bitterbrush
   habitat for wildlife browse will likely require a mosaic pattern of
   burning at the landscape scale or a burning frequency well beyond 11
   years to allow a bitterbrush seed crop to develop. Published by Elsevier

Pages = {{249-255}},
Abstract = {{Ash is generated in every wildfire, but its eco-hydro-geomorphic effects
   remain poorly understood and quantified, especially at large spatial
   scales. Here we present a new method that allows modelling the spatial
   distribution of ash loads in the post-fire landscape, based on a severe
   wildfire that burnt similar to 13600ha of a forested water supply
   catchment in October 2013 (2013 Hall Road Fire, 100km south-west of
   Sydney, Australia). Employing an existing spectral ratio-based index, we
   developed a new spectral index using Landsat 8 satellite imagery: the
   normalised wildfire ash index (NWAI). Before- and after-fire images were
   normalised and a differenced wildfire ash image (dNWAI) computed. The
   relationship between dNWAI and ash loads (t ha(-1)) quantified in situ
   at nine sampling locations burnt under a range of fire severities was
   determined using a polynomial regression (R-2=0.98). A spatially applied
   model was computed within a geographic information system (GIS) to
   illustrate the spatial distribution of ash across the area burnt and to
   estimate ash loads in the five subcatchments affected by the wildfire.
   Approximately 181000 tonnes of ash was produced by the wildfire, with
   specific loads increasing with fire severity. This new tool to model
   wildfire ash distribution can inform decisions about post-fire land
   management in future wildfires in the region. It can also be adapted for
   its application in other fire-prone environments.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying post-fire effects in a forested landscape is important to
   ascertain burn severity, ecosystem recovery and post-fire hazard
   assessments and mitigation planning. Reporting of such post-fire effects
   assumes significance in fire-prone countries such as USA, Australia,
   Spain, Greece and Portugal where prescribed burns are routinely carried
   out. This paper describes the use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) to
   estimate and map change in the forest understorey following a prescribed
   burn. Eighteen descriptive metrics are derived from bi-temporal TLS
   which are used to analyse and visualise change in a control and
   fire-altered plot. Metrics derived are Above Ground Height-based (AGH)
   percentiles and heights, point count and mean intensity. Metrics such as
   AGH50(change), mean AGH(change) and point count(change) are sensitive
   enough to detect subtle fire-induced change (28\%-52\%) whilst observing
   little or no change in the control plot (0-4\%). A qualitative
   examination with field measurements of the spatial distribution of burnt
   areas and percentage area burnt also show similar patterns. This study
   is novel in that it examines the behaviour of TLS metrics for estimating
   and mapping fire induced change in understorey structure in a
   single-scan mode with a minimal fixed reference system. Further, the
   TLS-derived metrics can be used to produce high resolution maps of
   change in the understorey landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Restoring Midwestern oak savannas and woodlands over the long term
   requires balancing mortality of large oaks with recruitment of oaks into
   large size classes. At restoration sites in northwestern Ohio, we
   tracked survival of large oak trees (>= 20 cm in stem diameter) and
   recruitment between 2002 and 2015 after initial tree thinning and
   prescribed burning treatments. The 24 study sites spanned a gradient of
   canopy cover from unrestored forests to restored woodlands and savannas.
   Of 141 large black oak (Quercus velutina) and white oak (Quercus alba)
   trees alive in 2002, 79\% were alive 14 y later. Large oak survival
   varied among vegetation types, with restored savannas not losing a
   single tree, compared with 18\% mortality in unrestored forests and 28\%
   mortality in restored woodlands. At least some mortality in the
   woodlands was associated with a tornado that damaged two sites. Diameter
   distributions changed over the 14 y in all three vegetation types.
   Unrestored forests shifted toward proportionally greater large and fewer
   small diameter oaks. Meanwhile, restored woodlands, despite having the
   highest mortality of large oaks, still exceeded, via recruitment of new
   large oaks, the reconstructed pre-Euro-American-settlement tree density.
   Restored woodlands and savannas exhibited four-fold increases in oak
   recruitment potential (saplings 1 to 10 cm in diameter) between 2002 and
   2015. Ecological restoration processes have been compatible with
   conserving large oaks and sustaining oak recruitment potential.}},

Title = {{Adult bobcat (Lynx rufus) habitat selection in a longleaf pine savanna}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pine savannas are primarily managed with frequent prescribed
   fire (<= 3 years) to promote diversity of flora and fauna, and to
   maintain open, park-like conditions needed by species such as the
   endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). However, a
   knowledge gap exists in our understanding of bobcat (Lynx rufus) habitat
   selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct
   our future management decisions.
   Methods: We examined bobcat habitat selection in a pine savanna managed
   with frequent fires at two spatial scales (i.e., study area boundary
   {[}hereafter, landscape scale]) and annual area of use {[}95\% kernel
   density; local scale]), and assessed effects of prescribed fire on
   bobcat habitat selection. Specifically, we monitored 45 bobcats (16
   males and 29 females) during 2001-2007.
   Results: We found differential habitat selection by sex. At the
   landscape scale, female bobcats were closer to mixed pine-hardwoods,
   young pine, and secondary roads, but farther from mature pine and
   hardwoods stands relative to males. We found no difference in selection
   of agriculture, shrub-scrub, and primary roads between sexes. At the
   annual area of use scale, female bobcats were closer to secondary roads,
   but farther from agriculture and shrub-scrub relative to males. We found
   no difference in selection of mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods,
   hardwoods, young pine, and primary roads between sexes. Bobcats
   primarily selected for stands burned <= 1.1 years post-fire.
   Conclusions: Our results show that bobcats exploit a broad range of
   habitat types in pine landscapes managed with frequent fire and commonly
   use recently burned stands (<= 1.1 year post-fire), suggesting prey in
   many areas of this system are at risk of bobcat predation. Additionally,
   we suggest land managers consider scale of selection by bobcats when
   developing habitat management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plants can cause localized increases in resources (i.e., resource
   islands) that can persist after fire and create a heterogeneous

   sagebrush subcanopies would have increased seedling establishment and
   performance of post-fire seeded perennial bunchgrasses compared to
   burned interspaces. We used a randomized complete block design with five
   study sites located in southeast Oregon. The area was burned in a
   wildfire (2007) and reseeded in the same year with a seed mix that
   included non-native and native perennial bunchgrasses. Seedling density,
   height, and reproductive status were measured in October 2008 in burned
   subcanopy and interspace microsites. Non-native perennial grasses had
   greater densities than native species (P < 0.001) and were six times
   more abundant in burned subcanopies compared to burned interspaces (P <

   burned interspaces (P = 0.043). Seedlings were taller in burned

   large granite outcrop, providing an opportunity to study the response of
   Calothamnus rupestris Schauer, a fire-sensitive serotinous plant. The
   population was killed by the fire, but readily regenerated from seed
   stored in woody capsules. The post-fire population reached maturity
   after similar to 7.5 years, whereas the seed bank is unlikely to recover

Abstract = {{Understanding ecosystem responses to disturbance is important for
   effective management of biodiversity. Observed relationships between
   time since disturbance and diversity have taken a variety of forms, only
   some of which are explicitly predicted in models of vegetation
   succession. This makes generalization and predictions for specific
   communities difficult. Negative relationships have been the predominant
   diversity response to time since fire in fire-prone
   Mediterranean-climate ecosystems; however, few studies have analysed
   responses in infrequently burnt ecosystems such as Mediterranean-climate
   woodlands dominated by fire-sensitive trees. We used a space-for-time
   approach and multiple stand-ageing techniques (Landsat imagery, growth
   ring counts and growth ring-size relationships) to characterize
   diversity and compositional changes with time since fire (3-370+years)
   in fire-sensitive Eucalyptus salubris woodlands in south-western
   Australia. Species density and Pielou's evenness showed an overall
   U'-shaped response to time since fire, although variability between
   plots was considerable. Plant functional type and species composition
   differed with time since fire, with greater richness and cover of ground
   layer, and long dispersal potential' functional types with increasing
   time since fire. Conversely, there was an early or intermediate peak in
   taller and short dispersal potential' functional types. We propose that
   the unusual U'-shaped diversity-time since fire relationship is driven
   by competitively dominant tree and shrub layers having maximum cover at
   intermediate times since fire. Subdominant functional types were able to
   exploit lower levels of competition in the immediate post-fire period
   and after density-dependent thinning of the trees and shrubs.Synthesis

Abstract = {{Fire severity is increasing across the boreal forest biome as climate
   warms, and initial post-fire changes in tree demographic processes could
   be important determinants of long-term forest structure and carbon
   dynamics. To examine soil burn severity impacts on tree regeneration, we
   conducted experimental burns in summer 2012 that created a gradient of
   residual post-fire soil organic layer (SOL) depth within a mature,
   sparse-canopy Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) forest in the
   Eastern Siberian Arctic. Each fall from 2012 to 2016, we added larch
   seeds to plots along the burn severity gradient. We tracked density of
   new larch germinants and established seedlings (alive >= 1 year) during
   subsequent growing seasons, along with changes in seedbed conditions
   (permafrost thaw depth, moisture, and temperature). Over the study, a
   cumulative total of 17 and 18 new germinants m(-2) occurred in high and
   moderate severity treatments, respectively, while germinants were rare
   in unburned and low severity treatments (< 0.5 germinants m(-2)). Most
   seedlings (> 50\%) germinated in summer 2017, following a mast event in
   fall 2016, suggesting safe sites for germination were not fully occupied
   in previous years despite seed additions. By 2017, established seedling
   density was similar to 5 times higher on moderate and high severity
   treatments compared to other treatments. Cumulative total density of new
   germinants and established seedlings increased linearly with decreasing
   residual SOL depth, as did thaw depth, soil moisture, and soil
   temperature. Our findings suggest that increased soil burn severity
   could improve seedbed conditions and increase larch recruitment,
   assuming seed sources are available. If these demographic changes
   persist as stands mature, a climate-driven increase in soil burn
   severity could shift forest structure from sparse-canopy stands, which
   dominate this region of the Siberian Arctic, to high density stands,
   with potential implications for carbon, energy, and water cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, wildfires have affected extensive areas of
   theMediterranean region with negative impacts on the environment. Most
   of the studies on fire-affected areas have focused on sediment losses by
   overland flow, whereas few have addressed post-fire nutrient export. The
   present study aimed to address this research gap by assessing nitrogen
   (nitrate and total nitrogen) losses by overland flow in a recently burnt
   area in north-central Portugal. To this end, three burnt slopes were
   selected for their contrasting forest types (eucalypt vs. pine) and
   parent materials (granite vs. schist). The selected study sites were a
   eucalypt site on granite (BEG), a eucalypt site on schist (BES) and a
   maritime pine site on schist (BPS). Overland flow samples were collected
   during the first six months after the wildfire on a 1-to 2-weekly basis,
   after which this study had to be cancelled due to bench terracing of
   some of the sites. A peak in total nitrogen concentrations was observed
   in burnt areas immediately after the first post-fire rainfall event as a
   response to the erosion of the N-enriched ash layer. After this initial
   peak, smaller peaks were observed throughout the study period, mainly as
   a response to overland flow and/or erosion events. Nitrogen export
   differed strikingly between the two types of forests on schist, being
   higher at the eucalypt than at the pine site, due to the lack of a
   protective soil layer. Parent material did not play an important role on
   nitrogen export by overland flow since no significant differences were
   found between the eucalypt sites on granite and schist. The present
   study provides some insight into the differences in post-fire
   soilfertility losses between forest types and parent materials in the
   Mediterranean region, which is crucial information for defining
   post-fire land management measures to reduce soil degradation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Reduced fire frequency and severity associated with livestock grazing
   are cited as a cause of woody plant encroachment and thickening in
   rangelands, but such paradigms are difficult to test experimentally
   owing to limited opportunities to burn. Mulga (Acacia aneura) dominates
   25\% of the Australian continent and epitomises this quandary. We
   measured the effect of rare wildfires on tree and shrub mortality and
   subsequent regeneration in mulga-dominated communities to critically
   examine prevailing but unsubstantiated paradigms of vegetation
   structural change. Mortality of mature mulga trees was positively
   correlated with fire severity, which was negatively correlated with tree
   basal area per hectare. High-severity fires killed the majority of
   mulga, but only occurred in more open areas, whereas low-severity fires
   typical of many mulga communities did not kill substantial proportions
   of mature mulga. The majority of mulga saplings were killed across all
   sites regardless of fire severity. Seedling germination was stimulated
   by fire, but not dependent on it. Green turkey bush (Eremophila gilesii)
   was the only shrub species with >50\% mortality across all sites.
   Combined with the rarity of fire events in the historical record, our
   results, particularly limited fire mortality and enhanced post-fire
   seedling recruitment, suggest that the role of fire in shaping
   vegetation structure in mulga-dominated communities has been overstated.
   The decoupling of fire and vegetation structure is consistent with
   emerging regional studies in low-productivity semiarid environments.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal patterns of tree mortality and snag dynamics after fire were
   investigated over 10 years in a permanent plot design established

   persistence, tree fall patterns and variables influencing snag dynamics
   were assessed in deciduous, mixed and coniferous stands that experienced
   low- and moderate-severity fires. Temporal patterns of tree mortality
   for the three species revealed that mortality was delayed through time.
   Most post-fire tree mortality occurred within 2 years following fire but
   continued until the end of the 10-year observation period. Jack pine was
   the most persistent snag species, followed by trembling aspen and black
   spruce. Factors influencing the persistence of snags were multi-scaled
   and generally species-specific. Fire severity was the only common factor
   influencing snag persistence among all species, with snags located in
   severely-burned stands being less susceptible to falling. Trembling
   aspen snag persistence increased with basal area and diameter. Salvage
   logging in the vicinity affected black spruce. Fall patterns also
   differed among species. Bypasses of the snag stage (i.e. when a living
   tree falls directly to the forest floor) as well as uprooting of snags

Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-64}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major factor in the ecosystem dynamics of upland Florida
   habitats. Fire impacts have been well studied in terms of plant
   community responses, but the effects of fire on soil characteristics and
   post-fire plant-microbial interactions in these systems remain poorly
   documented. We investigated the effect of fire intensity and pre-fire
   vegetation on soil biogeochemistry in Florida scrubby flatwoods. We
   measured vegetation structure in 30 plots of 1/4 m radius before a
   prescribed burn. Fire duration and temperatures were recorded in each
   plot. Soil samples taken immediately preceding and 2 w after the burn
   were analyzed for organic matter, inorganic N, available P and K, N
   mineralization rates, and potential nitrification rates. All nutrients
   and N mineralization rates significantly increased after fire. N and P
   increases were positively correlated with both fire intensity and
   vegetation. N mineralization was most strongly correlated with changes
   in available soil P, suggesting P stimulated N mineralization. These
   results contrast with the few other studies in Florida scrub, which
   found no effect of fire on soil nutrients. We suggest that taking
   measurements within a few weeks of burn and using a shallow sampling
   depth is necessary to document the nutrient pulse in these sandy,
   nutrient poor systems, and we recommend more research into fire's effect
   on the soil microbial community. Fire's impact on nutrients and nutrient
   turnover rates could have important repercussions on post-fire
   vegetation regrowth. Understanding the effects of fires on soils is
   therefore critical to developing fire management protocols.}},

Abstract = {{During 2008, under a region-wide drought, there were a large number of
   simultaneous fires in the Parana River Delta region: the most affected
   vegetation was in marshes dominated by Schoenoplectus californicus
   (C.A.Mey.) Sojak or Cyperus giganteus Vahl. The objective of this paper
   was to study fire severity in terms of fire effect on vegetation cover
   and soil properties, and the recovery of those properties after one
   growing season, using optical remote sensing techniques and fieldwork
   data. To this aim, we performed unsupervised classification of Landsat
   TM imagery and conducted vegetation censuses and soil sampling in
   November 2008 and May 2009. Our results show that we could identify
   three fire severity classes: low severity, medium severity, and high
   severity. These classes are characterized by a remnant vegetation cover
   of approximately 75\%, 25\%, and 5\%, respectively, and a diminution of
   soil organic carbon and nitrogen of 66\% and 59\% in the case of medium
   severity and high severity. Fire had almost no effect over pH and a
   slight effect on electrical conductivity. After one growing season,
   vegetation recovery is dependent on fire severity and hydrological
   condition, while soil properties did not show signs of recovery. This is
   one of the first studies of fire effects and recovery on fluvial

Abstract = {{Wildfire increases the likelihood of runoff, erosion, and downstream
   sedimentation in many of the watersheds that supply water for Colorado's
   Front Range communities. The objectives of this study were to: (1)
   identify rainfall intensity thresholds for a post-fire runoff or
   sediment delivery response at plots (<= 0.06 ha), hillslopes (0.07-5.2
   ha) and watersheds (100-1500 ha) after three Colorado Front Range
   wildfires for up to four years post fire; (2) determine how the rainfall
   thresholds varied by fire location, year post-fire, spatial scale, and
   mulch treatments; and (3) use long-term rainfall data to map the likely
   frequency of rainfall events above these intensity thresholds as an
   indicator of risk for post-fire runoff or sediment delivery from future
   high severity fires in Colorado. Maximum 60-min rainfall intensity
   (MI60) thresholds were identified as the values that best separated rain
   storms that generated responses from those that did not. We found that
   thresholds did not significantly differ among fires for any year
   post-fire. Thresholds did significantly vary among spatial scales; for
   the first two years post-fire, high-confidence thresholds ranged from 4
   to 8 mm h(-1) across unmulched plots, hillslopes and watersheds.
   Compared to post-fire year 0, thresholds in year 3 were significantly
   higher, with high-confidence thresholds up to 22 mm h(-1). NOAA Atlas
   rainfall data were used to compute and map frequencies of threshold
   exceedance across Colorado. Within the Front Range study area, rain
   storms with MI60 of 4 mm h(-1) have frequencies ranging from 5 to 11
   times per summer, while MI60 values of 8 mm h(-1) have frequencies of
   2-5 times per summer. Maps of threshold exceedance frequency can help
   identify areas most vulnerable to post-fire runoff and sediment delivery
   and prioritize post-fire emergency planning.}},

Title = {{Fuel dynamics and reburn severity following high-severity fire in a
   Sierra Nevada, USA, mixed-conifer forest}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-severity fire in forested landscapes often produces a
   post-fire condition of high shrub cover and large loads of dead wood.
   Given the increasing patch size of high-severity fire and the tendency
   for these areas to reburn at high severity in subsequent wildfires,
   post-fire management often targets restoration of these areas. However,
   these areas are challenging to manage, in part due to limited knowledge
   of post-fire fuel dynamics over space and time and uncertainties in how
   specific fuel components such as snags and logs influence future fire
   severity. In this study, we used high-resolution aerial imagery
   collected nine years after a wildfire to measure snags, logs, and shrub
   cover within high-severity patches, and to assess how fuel development
   influenced reburn severity in a subsequent wildfire.
   Results: The abundance of snags, logs, and shrubs following
   high-severity fire varied with elevation and slope steepness; however,
   generalized additive models explained only 6 to 21\% of their variation
   over the post-fire landscape. High densities of both snags and logs were
   associated with high reburn severity in a subsequent fire, while shrub
   cover had a marginally insignificant (P = 0.0515) effect on subsequent
   fire severity.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that high levels of large dead
   wood, which is often not considered in fire behavior modeling,
   corresponded with repeated high-severity fire effects. Future research
   should leverage the increasing availability of high-resolution imagery
   to improve our understanding of fuel load patterns in space and time and
   how they may impact landscape resilience to facilitate management
   planning for post-fire forest landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are a recurrent phenomenon in Mediterranean forests, with
   impacts for human landscapes and communities, which must be understood
   before they can be managed. This study used the physically based Limburg
   Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) to simulate rainfall-runoff response, under
   soil water repellent (SWR) conditions and different stages of vegetation
   recovery. Five rainfall-runoff events were selected, representing wet
   and dry conditions, spread over two years after a wildfire which burned
   eucalypt and maritime pine plantations in the Colmeal experimental
   micro-catchment, central Portugal. Each event was simulated using three
   Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimates: indirect field-based measurements
   (TC-LAI), NDVI-based estimates derived from Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7
   ETM+ imagery (NDVI-LAI), and the LAI of a fully restored canopy to test
   model sensitivity to interception parameters. LISEM was able to simulate
   events in relative terms but underestimated peak runoff (r(2) = 0.36,
   mean error = -31\%, and NSE = -0.15) and total runoff (r(2) = 0.52, mean
   error = -15\% and NSE = 0.09), which could be related to the presence of
   SWR or saturated areas, according to pre-rainfall soil moisture
   conditions. The model performed better for individual hydrographs,
   especially under wet conditions. Modelling the full-cover scenario
   showed minor sensitivity of LISEM to the observed changes in LAI.
   NDVI-LAI data gave a close to equal model performance with TC-LAI and
   therefore can be considered a suitable substitute for ground-based
   measurements in post-fire runoff predictions. However, more attention
   should be given to representing pre-rainfall soil moisture conditions
   and especially the presence of SWR. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Fire mosses, including Ceratodon purpureus, Funaria hygrometrica and

   conducted a survey of moss cover and erosion-related functions after 10
   wildfires in Pinus ponderosa and mixed-conifer forests of the
   southwestern USA. We sampled 65 plots in high-severity patches,
   stratifying by elevation and insolation over each fire. Using three
   landscape-scale predictor variables and one temporal predictor, we
   explained 37\% of the variance in fire moss cover using a random forest
   model. The predictors in order of importance were: equinox insolation
   (sunlight/day), pre-fire vegetation type, pre-fire soil organic carbon
   and time since fire. Within each plot we examined differences between
   bare and moss-covered soil surface microsites and found moss-covered
   microsites had a mean increase of 55\% water infiltration, 106\% shear
   strength, 162\% compressive strength and 195\% aggregate stability. We
   tested a suite of nutrients, finding 35\% less manganese in the

   surface erosion resistance and hydrological function, with implications

Abstract = {{Burn severity can be mapped using satellite data to detect changes in
   forest structure and moisture content caused by fires. The 2001 Leroux
   fire on the Coconino National Forest, Arizona, burned over 18
   preexisting permanent 0.1 ha plots. Plots were re-measured following the
   fire. Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery and the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio
   (Delta NBR) were used to map the fire into four severity levels
   immediately following the fire (July 2001) and 1 year after the fire
   (June 2002). Ninety-two Composite Burn Index (CBI) plots were compared
   to the fire severity maps. Pre- and post-fire plot measurements were
   also analysed according to their imagery classification. Ground
   measurements demonstrated differences in forest structure. Areas that
   were classified as severely burned on the imagery were predominantly
   Pinus ponderosa stands. Tree density and basal area, snag density and
   fine fuel accumulation were associated with severity levels. Tree
   mortality was not greatest in severely burned areas, indicating that the
   Delta NBR is comprehensive in rating burn severity by incorporating
   multiple forest strata. While the Delta NBR was less accurate at mapping
   perimeters, the method was reliable for mapping severely burned areas
   that may need immediate or long-term post-fire recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires alter nitrogen (N) cycling in Mediterranean-type ecosystems,
   resetting plant and soil microbial growth, combusting plant biomass to
   ash, and enhancing N availability in the upper soil layer. This ash and
   soil N pool (that is, wildfire N) is susceptible to loss from watersheds
   via runoff and leaching during post-fire rains. Plant and soil microbial
   recovery may mitigate these losses by sequestering N compounds in new
   biomass, thereby promoting landscape N retention in N-limited chaparral
   ecosystems. We investigated the relative balance between wildfire N
   loss, and plant and soil microbial N uptake and stream N export for an
   upland chaparral watershed in southern California that burned (61\%) in
   a high-intensity wildfire in 2009 by using a combination of stream,
   vegetation, soil microbial, and remote sensing analyses. Soil N in the
   burn scar was 440\% higher than unburned soil N in the beginning of the
   first post-fire wet season and returned within 66 days to pre-fire
   levels. Stream N export was 1480\% higher than pre-fire export during
   the first post-fire rain and returned within 106 days over the course of
   the following three rainstorms to pre-fire levels. A watershed-scale N
   mass balance revealed that 52\% of wildfire N could be accounted for in
   plant and soil microbial growth, whereas 1\% could be accounted for in
   stream export of dissolved nitrogen.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire assessment is made after a wildfire incident to provide
   details about damage level and its distribution over burned areas. Such
   assessments inform restoration plans and future monitoring of ecosystem
   recovery. Due to the high cost and time to conduct fieldwork, remote
   sensing is an appealing alternative to assess post-fire condition over
   larger areas than can be surveyed practically in the field. The aim of
   this study is to use remote sensing data to characterize post-fire
   severity at tree level in a mixed conifer forest following the Cascade
   and East Zone megafires of 2007 in central Idaho, USA. We used remote
   sensing metrics derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data (2008)
   and high-resolution QuickBird (QB) multispectral satellite imagery
   (2007-2009) for calibrating and validating predictive models with field
   data (2008). We compared fire effects on trees in open canopies within
   recent fuel treatments to similar trees in closed canopies on adjacent,
   untreated sites. We observed more trees with charred crowns in high fire
   severity sites, mostly untreated, whereas we observed more trees with
   live crowns in low fire severity sites, independent of the treatment.
   Individual trees were more accurately detected from ALS data in treated
   sites with open canopies than untreated sites with closed canopies. For
   detected trees, the response variables predicted from ALS and QB metrics
   were total height (Ht), crown base height (CBH), total basal area
   (BA(T)), live basal area (BA(L)), scorched basal area (BA(S)), charred
   basal area (BA(C)) and crown severity (CS). None of the selected QB
   metrics were strongly correlated with the selected ALS metrics, which
   justified combining both data types into the predictive models. Random
   Forest regression models combining ALS + QB metrics or using ALS metrics
   alone performed similarly but clearly better than models using only QB
   metrics. This study shows the superiority of ALS data to high
   resolution, multispectral QB imagery for mapping fire severity at tree
   level. Managers with limited resources to plan for restoration of fire
   affected forests are advised to prioritize spending for data collection
   on ALS data and a modest number of field inventory plots, rather than QB
   or other broadband satellite imagery.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although fire is an important factor in determining cerrado
   vegetation, information about its effect on seed banks is sparse.
   Cerrado fires are rapidly moving surface fires with low residence time,
   producing only short-term heating of the uppermost centimetres of the
   soil. However, the reduction in vegetation cover and deposition of ashes
   increases the daily amplitude of soil temperature by as much as 35
   degrees C.
   Aims: To assess the effect of post-fire daily soil temperatures on the
   germination of one alien and nine native grasses.
   Methods: Seeds were stored at alternating temperatures of 45 oC/10 oC
   (10h/14h) for 7d or 30d, simulating two different storage times in the
   soil seed bank before the onset of the rainy season. Germination was
   monitored over 30d.
   Results: The variation in temperature had a significant effect on the
   rate of seed germination in some species, either enhancing it (Aristida
   setifolia) or reducing it (Schizachyrium sanguineum). Increased storage
   time reduced the viability of S. sanguineum and Echinolaena inflexa. The
   invasive Melinis minutiflora had the highest germination rate and it
   also showed the best toleration of post-fire conditions (45 oC/10 oC)
   after 7d, with significant reduction in the germination time after 30d.
   Conclusions: Fire seems to have a significant effect in the early life
   of cerrado grasses. Some native species responded positively to
   temperature oscillation, suggesting that they should be better prepared
   to compete with alien species after a fire, with more of their seeds
   germinating and/or at a more rapid rate.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of ecological and structrual changes induced by fire events
   is important for understanding the effects of fire, and planning future
   ecological and risk mitigation strategies. This study employs
   Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data captured at multiple points in
   time to monitor the changes in a dry sclerophyll forest induced by a
   prescribed burn. Point cloud data was collected for two plots; one plot
   undergoing a fire treatment, and the second plot remaining untreated,
   thereby acting as the control. Data was collected at three epochs
   (pre-fire, two weeks post fire and two years post fire). Coregistration
   of these multitemporal point clouds to within an acceptable tolerance
   was achieved through a two step process utilising permanent infield
   markers and manually extracted stem objects as reference targets.
   Metrics describing fuel height and fuel fragmentation were extracted
   from the point clouds for direct comparison with industry standard
   visual assessments. Measurements describing the change (or lack thereof)
   in the control plot indicate that the method of data capture and
   coregistration were achieved with the required accuracy to monitor fire
   induced change. Results from the fire affected plot show that
   immediately post fire 67\% of area had been burnt with the average fuel
   height decreasing from 0.33 to 0.13 m. At two years post-fire the fuel
   remained signicantly lower (0.11 m) and more fragmented in comparison to
   pre-fire levels. Results in both the control and fire altered plot were
   comparable to synchronus onground visual assessment. The advantage of
   TLS over the visual assessment method is, however, demonstrated through
   the use of two physical and spatially quantifiable metrics to describe
   fuel change. These results highlight the capabilities of multitemporal
   TLS data for measuring and mapping changes in the three dimensional
   structure of vegetation. Metrics from point clouds can be derived to
   provide quantified estimates of surface and near-surface fuel loss and
   accumulation, and inform prescribed burn efficacy and burn severity
   reporting.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean Basin, changes in climate and fire regime
   (increased recurrence and severity) reduce ecosystem services after
   wildfires by increasing soil degradation and losses in plant diversity.
   Our study was a biological approach to relate soil properties to
   vegetation recovery and burn severity. We focused our study on the
   natural recovery of the soil-plant interphase in Pinus halepensis Mill.
   forests located in the SE of Iberian Peninsula, a semiarid climate. We
   included some chemical properties 3 years after fire (available
   phosphorus (P) and soil organic carbon (Corg), among others), and
   biological soil indicators 3 and 5 years after fire (i.e. basal soil
   respiration (BSR), microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), carbon
   mineralization coefficient (Cmineral), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and
   microbial quotient (Cmic:Corg)). We analyzed the activity of three
   different enzymes: urease (UR), phosphatase (PHP) and beta-glucosidase
   (GLU).
   The changes in most chemical properties were ephemeral, but P and Corg
   showed higher values in burned areas, and the highest were found for
   low-moderate severity. Plant recovery was the triggering factor for the
   recovery of Corg and biological soil function. Burn severity and time
   after fire influenced Cmic and the Cmic:Corg, which were higher for
   moderate-high severity 3 years later, but were below the unburned values
   5 years after fire. The microbial activities of GLU and UR were
   recovered in burned areas 5 years after fire. The PHP values lowered
   according to higher burn severity and time after fire. The soil
   ecological trends obtained by a principal component analysis revealed a
   relationship linking GLU, BSR and qCO(2) that explained soil response to
   burn severity. PHP, Cmic and Cmic:Corg explained most of the variability
   related to time after fire.
   Our results provide insights into how burn severity, in Mediterranean
   fire-prone Aleppo pine stands, modulated the natural plant recovery
   linked to soil biochemical and microbiological response to fire. High
   burn severity limited natural vegetation recovery, and both reduced
   biological soil functionality. This knowledge can be implemented in
   post-fire planning to apply post-fire management (for mitigation and
   restoration) in which the ``no intervention{''} tool should be
   contemplated. These findings provide information to be applied in
   adaptive forest management to improve the resilience of vulnerable
   ecosystems and to reduce burn severity in future fire events.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The combination of direct human influences and the effects of climate
   change are resulting in altered ecological disturbance regimes, and this
   is especially the case for wildfires. Many regions that historically
   experienced low-moderate severity fire regimes are seeing increased area
   burned at high severity as a result of interactions between high fuel
   loads and climate warming with a number of negative ecological effects.
   While ecosystem impacts of altered fire regimes have been examined in
   the literature, little is known of the effects of changing fire regimes
   on forest understory plant diversity even though understory taxa
   comprise the vast majority of forest plant species and play vital roles
   in overall ecosystem function. We examined understory plant diversity
   across gradients of wildfire severity in eight large wildfires in yellow
   pine and mixed conifer temperate forests of the Sierra Nevada,
   California, USA. We found a generally unimodal hump-shaped relationship
   between local (alpha) plant diversity and fire severity. High-severity
   burning resulted in lower local diversity as well as some homogenization
   of the flora at the regional scale. Fire severity class, post-fire
   litter cover, and annual precipitation were the best predictors of
   understory species diversity. Our research suggests that increases in
   fire severity in systems historically characterized by low and moderate
   severity fire may lead to plant diversity losses. These findings
   indicate that global patterns of increasing fire size and severity may
   have important implications for biodiversity.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{203-216}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are increasing in size and severity in forested landscapes
   across the Western United States. Not only do fires alter land surfaces,
   but they also affect the surface water quality in downstream systems.
   Previous studies of individual fires have observed an increase in
   various forms of nutrients, ions, sediments and metals in stream water
   for different post-fire time periods. In this research, data were
   compiled for over 24 000 fires across the western United States to
   evaluate post-fire water-quality response. The database included
   millions of water-quality data points downstream of these fires, and was
   synthesised along with geophysical data from each burned watershed. Data
   from 159 fires in 153 burned watersheds were used to identify common
   water-quality response during the first 5 years after a fire. Within
   this large dataset, a subset of seven fires was examined further to
   identify trends in water-quality response. Change-point analysis was
   used to identify moments in the post-fire water-quality data where
   significant shifts in analyte concentrations occurred. Evaluating
   individual fires revealed strong initial increases or decreases in
   concentrations, depending on the analyte, that are masked when averaged
   over 5 years. Evidence from this analysis shows significant increases in
   nutrient flux (different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus), major-ion
   flux and metal concentrations are the most common changes in stream
   water quality within the first 5 years after fire. Dissolved
   constituents of ions and metals tended to decrease in concentration 5
   years after fire whereas particulate matter concentration continued to
   increase. Assembling this unique and extensive dataset provided the
   opportunity to determine the most common post-fire water-quality changes
   in the large and diverse Western USA. Results from this study could
   inform studies in other parts of the world, will help parameterise and
   validate post-fire water-quality models, and assist communities affected
   by wildfire to anticipate changes to their water quality.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{In fire-suppressed oak-chaparral communities, land managers have treated
   thousands of hectares by mechanical mastication to reduce hazardous
   fuels in areas of wildland-urban interface. The chipped debris, which
   decomposes slowly, can be burned to minimize wildfire hazard. The
   question is whether controlled burning of masticated debris results in
   loss of native plant species richness and abundance, allowing for gains
   in non-native species. We examined the response of vegetation to the
   seasonality of prescribed fire and to post-fire seeding in mechanically
   masticated oak-chaparral communities in the Applegate Valley of
   southwestern Oregon, USA. At the landscape level, treatments did not
   differ. At the site level, response of native and non-native species
   varied by site and treatment. Following prescribed fire, native species
   decreased in cover and increased in species richness; non-native species
   increased in cover and in species richness. Seven species that were not
   observed on pre-treatment plots appeared after burn treatments.
   Non-native annual grasses and forbs increased following both spring and
   fall burns. Among native species, annuals declined in cover while
   perennials increased slightly. Both annual and perennial natives
   increased in species richness following burn treatments. Community
   patterns at the site scale changed following all treatments. Seeded
   bunchgrasses, Lemmon's needlegrass (Achnatherum lemmonii {[}Vasey]
   Barkworth), California brome (Bromus carinatus Hook. and Arn.), blue
   wildrye (Elymus glaucus Buckley), and Roemer's fescue (Festuca
   idahoensis Elmer ssp. roemeri {[}Pavlick] S. Aiken), successfully
   established following fall prescribed fires, but not following spring
   prescribed fires or in unburned controls. Post-fire seeding and
   subsequent increased bunchgrass cover correlated with decreased
   non-native species. Prescribed low severity fire followed by post-fire
   seeding during the wet, cool season is a viable tool for introducing
   native bunchgrasses while controlling non-native species in mechanically

   in mesocosms, each containing three exotic grasses (Nassella neesiana,
   Chloris gayana, Eragrostis curvula) and three native grasses (Themeda
   australis, Microlaena stipoides, Chloris ventricosa) under elevated (700
   ppm) and ambient (385 ppm) CO2 conditions. Resprouting response after
   fire at the community- and species-level was assessed. There was no
   difference in community-level biomass between CO2 treatments; however,
   exotic species made up a larger proportion of the community biomass
   under all treatments. There were species-level responses to elevated CO2
   but no significant interactions found between CO2 and burning or plant
   status. Two exotic grasses (N. neesiana and E. curvula, a C3 and a C4
   species respectively), and one native grass (M. stipoides, a C3 species)
   significantly increased in biomass, and a native C4 grass (C.
   ventricosa) significantly decreased in biomass under elevated CO2. These
   results suggest that although overall productivity of this community may
   not change with increases in CO2 and fire frequency, the community
   composition may alter due to differential species responses.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Evaluating fuel treatment effectiveness is challenging when
   managing a landscape for diverse ecological, social, and economic
   values. We used a Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) to
   understand Confederated Colville Tribal (CCT) member views regarding the
   location and effectiveness of fuel treatments within their ancestral
   territory within the Colville National Forest (CNF) boundary. The 2015
   North Star Fire burned 88 221 ha (218 000 acres) of the CCT ancestral
   territory.
   Results: We sampled thirty plot pairs that were treated or untreated
   prior to being burned by the North Star Fire and again one growing
   season post fire. Species diversity was significantly increased by
   wildfire in both treated and untreated plots. Species richness was
   significantly increased in the plots that were treated, and there was no
   significant change in species richness from wildfire within the
   untreated plots. The percent canopy cover of two of the six culturally
   important plants (Fragaria spp. L. and Arnica cordifolia Hook.)
   significantly increased one growing season post wildfire within treated
   plots and one (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi {[}L.] Spreng.) significantly
   decreased in the treated plots post wildfire. These post-fire monitoring
   results were consistent with CCT member management recommendations and
   desired outcomes of understory thinning, prescribed fire, and natural
   ignition found using PGIS.
   Conclusions: Together, the results suggest that prior thinning and
   prescribed burning can foster vegetation response to subsequent
   wildfires, including culturally important plants. Further, integrating
   Traditional Knowledge (TK) into fuels treatments can improve ongoing
   adaptive management of national forests that include tribal ancestral
   lands.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are a natural and ubiquitous component of many forests.
   Fire-induced damages can lead to immediate tree mortality or a prolonged
   state of decline. However, physiological mechanisms behind the
   phenomenon are not well understood. We investigated physiological
   properties of conifers that survived wildfire 2 year post-fire in
   central Idaho, USA. In 2005, we set up a burned plot at each of three
   sites, where the independent wildfires damaged dominant conifers in
   2003, paired with a comparable adjacent control plot without any fire
   damage. At each burned plot, we assessed physical damages in the burned
   conifers. At each plot in a given site, we repeatedly measured
   physiological characteristics in five trees of a dominant conifer
   species (Pseudotsuga menziesii or Pinus contorta) to compare burned and
   control plots across the three sites during the 2005 growing season.
   Growth of the burned conifers was significantly reduced post-fire. Leaf
   area of burned conifers was significantly reduced due to scorching,
   which, in theory, should have led to increased stomatal conductance
   (g(s)) and leaf specific conductance (K-L). However, we did not find
   significant differences in KL between burned and control conifers, and
   gs was sometimes even lower in burned than control conifers. These
   results indicate the wildfires reduced capacity of hydraulic apparatus
   in the surviving conifers, partly due to reduced sapwood area associated
   with the decreased stem growth post-fire. This was supported by our
   finding that integrated water use efficiency, assessed via delta C-13 of
   woody materials and foliage, was not significantly affected by the
   wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{Global changes are influencing fire regimes in many parts of the world.
   In the Fynbos plant diversity hotspot (Cape Floristic Region, South
   Africa), fire frequency has increased in protected areas where the mean
   fire interval went from 12-19 to 6-9 years between 1970 and 2000. Fire
   is one of the main drivers of plant diversity in the Cape Floristic
   Region. Too frequent fires threaten the persistence of slow-maturing
   plant species, and such insights have led to the adoption of fire
   management principles based on plant responses. The effects of fire on
   Fynbos fauna are much more poorly understood, and have not generally
   been considered in depth in Fynbos conservation policies, planning or
   management. We assessed the response of bird communities to long-term
   fire-induced vegetation changes using space-for-time substitution. We
   studied bird communities, vegetation structure and plant functional
   composition in 84 Fynbos plots burnt between two and 18 years before.
   Ten of the 14 bird species analysed showed a significant change in their
   abundance with time since fire. We observed a significant species
   turnover along the post-fire succession due to changes both in
   vegetation structure and plant functional composition, with a
   characteristic shift from non-Fynbos specialists and granivorous species
   to Fynbos specialists and nectarivorous species.
   If current trends of increasing fire frequency continue, Fynbos endemic
   birds such as nectarivores may become vulnerable. Conservation
   management should thus aim more carefully to maintain mosaics of Fynbos
   patches of different ages. Future research needs to estimate the
   proportion of vegetation of different ages and patch sizes needed to
   support dependent fauna, particularly endemics. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Post-fire forest management commonly requires accepting some negative
   ecological impacts from management activities in order to achieve
   management objectives. Managers need to know, however, whether
   ecological impacts from post-fire management activities are transient or
   cause long-term ecosystem degradation. We studied the long-term response
   of understory vegetation to two post-fire logging treatments- commercial
   salvage logging with and without additional fuel reduction logging- on a
   long-term post-fire logging experiment in northeastern Oregon, USA. We
   sampled understory plant cover and species diversity on 10-11 sampling
   plots within each of nine experimental treatment units to see if
   post-fire logging treatments produced any lasting effects on understory
   plant cover, species diversity, community composition, or exotic species
   cover. Post-fire logging treatments produced no significant effects on
   understory vegetation cover, diversity, or community composition 15
   years after treatment. We found no significant treatment effects on
   graminoid, forb, woody plant, or exotic plant cover and species
   richness, and differences among treatment means were generally small.
   Differences in treatment means were larger at the individual species
   level, but were only statistically significant for one native grass,
   California brome (Bromus carinatus), which responded differently to the
   two logging treatments. Multivariate analysis of understory plant
   communities across 91 sample plots found two major gradients in
   understory plant community composition, one correlated with regenerating
   forest (sapling) density and one correlated with residual overstory tree
   density, suggesting that initial fire severity (tree mortality) and
   post-fire regeneration may have greater long-term impacts on post-fire
   understory vegetation than post-fire logging. This study demonstrates
   that understory vegetation can be resilient to post-fire logging,
   particularly when best management practices, like logging over snow, are
   used to limit damage to soils and understory vegetation. Further
   research is needed to establish the generality of our results and to
   identify sources of variability in understory plant community responses
   to wildfire and post fire logging. If further research confirms our
   findings, post-fire logging debates will be able to focus more on how to
   mitigate short-term disturbance impacts and manage fire-killed trees to
   meet wildlife habitat, fuel reduction, and economic objectives, and less
   on concerns over long-term ecosystem degradation. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The impact of fire on the resilience of tree and shrub species

   Although some scorched mountain beech trees flushed, virtually all trees
   died within five years. The few surviving mountain beech seedlings
   mostly occurred within 20 m of the forest margin and were less common on
   a north-facing transect than a south-facing transect. Other woody
   species (e.g., of Coprosma and Pseudopanax) commonly sprouted from burnt
   stumps. Increased density over time of saplings and seedlings >15 cm
   tall was primarily the result of onward growth of fire survivors, rather
   than post-fire establishment. Between 1981 and 1995, some of the
   earliest colonisers disappeared and a few herbaceous species gradually
   increased to become dominant. Current dominance by the exotic Agrostis
   capillaris appears a consequence of recent changes in nearby tussock
   grasslands and strongly limits beech seedling establishment. Partial
   canonical correspondence analysis showed that time and distance alone
   explained significant components of the compositional variation. Because
   little variation was explained by the interplay between time and

Abstract = {{In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in
   height and leaf area without a comparable reduction in the size of the

   transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative
   reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that
   this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large
   growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (Pinus palustris
   Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (g(s)),
   mid-day leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)), leaf-specific whole-plant
   hydraulic conductance (K-L.p), leaf area and height of 10 species
   covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As
   predicted, K-L.p was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned
   plants, and the post-fire increase in K-L.p was positively related to
   plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the
   greatest relative reductions in leaf area and height, and
   correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in K-L.p. The
   post-fire increase in K-L.p was smaller than expected, however, due to a
   decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to
   leaf area). The higher K-L.p in burned sites was manifested as an
   increase in gs rather than an increase in Psi(leaf). Post-fire increases
   in gs should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of
   carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly
   important for large-statured species that require more time to recover
   their pre-fire size.}},

Pages = {{932-945}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical mastication converts shrub and small tree fuels into surface
   fuels, and this method is being widely used as a treatment to reduce
   fire hazard. The compactness of these fuelbeds is thought to moderate
   fire behaviour, but whether standard fuel models can accurately predict
   fire behaviour and effects is poorly understood. Prescribed burns were
   conducted in young ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests at two
   sites in northern California where the midstorey layer dominated by
   shrubs had been masticated. Surface fuels were raked from the base of a
   subset of trees before burning. Rate of spread and flame length were
   estimated for both backing and heading fires, soil heating measured with
   thermocouples and tree fire injury recorded. Standard fuel models often
   over-predicted rate of spread or underpredicted flame length. Custom
   models generally provided a better balance between the slow rates of
   spread and moderate flame lengths observed in prescribed burns.
   Post-fire tree mortality was most strongly associated with crown scorch
   and tree size; raking fuels from the base of trees did not improve
   survival. Under severe fire weather conditions, fire behaviour and
   effect models as well as observations from wildfires suggest that
   mastication may be more effective for moderating fire behaviour than
   reducing residual tree mortality. Treating masticated fuels with

Abstract = {{Question: How are dynamics of early-seral post-fire vascular plant and
   bryoid (terrestrial mosses, lichens, and fungi) vegetation impacted by
   reforestation activities, particularly manual vegetation removal and
   planting density? Does the relationship between vegetation dynamics and
   vegetation removal differ between harsh (west-facing) and moderate
   (east-facing) aspects?
   Location: Five high-severity burn plantation forests of Pseudotsuga
   menziesii in southwestern Oregon, USA.
   Methods: Plantations severely burned in a recent wildfire were planted
   with conifer seedlings as a four-species mixture or a monoculture, at
   two different densities, with and without manual vegetation removal. A
   subset of plots was also planted on a contrasting aspect within each
   plantation. The contrasting aspects differed in potential solar
   insolation and were indicative of moderate (eastern exposure) and harsh
   (western exposure) site conditions. Covers of shrub, herbaceous and
   bryoid vegetation layers were measured during reforestation activities
   2-4 yr after the fire. Dynamics of structural layer cover and community
   composition were compared among treatments with analysis of variance and
   multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling and blocked
   multi-response permutation procedure).
   Results: Structural layer cover and community composition differed
   between areas that received reforestation treatments and untreated
   areas. However, variability within treatments in a plantation was
   greater than variability within treatments across plantations. Effects
   of vegetation removal on composition and structure were more evident
   than effects of planting or altering planting density. Vegetation
   removal decreased cover of tall and low shrub and the bryoid layer, and
   increased herbaceous layer cover. Bryoid community and low shrub
   structural layer responses were more pronounced on moderate aspects than
   on harsh aspects. Vegetation removal shifted vascular plant community
   composition towards exotic and annual species.
   Conclusions: These reforestation treatments may be implemented without
   substantially altering early-seral vegetation community composition
   dynamics, especially in areas with harsh site conditions. Site
   conditions, such as aspect, should be evaluated to determine need and
   potential effects of reforestation before implementation. Monitoring for
   exotic species establishment should follow reforestation activities.}},

   objective of this study is to assess the effect of a prescribed fire on
   some soil properties, hydrological response and vegetation recovery in
   experimental plots 5 years after. The results showed that: i) with the
   exception of electrical conductivity, the prescribed fire did not affect
   the analyzed soil properties, and ii) overland flow and sediment
   transport were increased during the first two years, returning to levels
   prefire, 5 years post-fire. The rainfall threshold for overland flow
   generation was lower during the following months after the prescribed
   fire owing to the depletion of the vegetation cover. Immediately after
   the fire, the vegetation cover was of 1.9\%, being the three main soil
   surface components that dominated the hydrological response: charcoal
   and decayed wood; blackish and greyish ash, and bare soil. However,
   these areas decreased very rapidly during the second year following the
   fire, principally, owing to the regrowth of herbaceous plants and
   shrubs. In addition, the vegetation cover in burned plots was 16.1\%
   higher than that measured in the unburned ones. Overall, the prescribed
   fire only had an impact on runoff and sediment transport in the two
   years post-fire, as consequence of vegetation removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Fire in tropical forests increases tree mortality, degrades forest
   structure, and reduces carbon stocks. Currently, there are large gaps in
   understanding how fire affects understory forest structure and
   composition, interactions with fire recurrence, and long-term impacts.
   Understanding these changes is critical to evaluate the present and
   future response of tropical forests to fire. We studied post-fire
   changes in understory regeneration in forests in Mato Grosso State,
   southern Amazonia, Brazil, aiming to answer the following questions: (i)
   does forest structure (basal area) and tree community composition vary
   with fire frequency and time since the last fire? (ii) does the response
   differ among strata (e.g., sapling, larger trees)? (iii) are changes in
   diversity associated with changes in forest structure? We surveyed trees
   and lianas in previously structurally intact forests that underwent
   selective logging, followed by different fire histories, including 5 and
   16 years after once-burned, 5 years after three times burned, and
   unburned (control). Overall, species composition (abundance, richness,
   and number of families) and diversity were highest for the unburned
   treatment and lowest for the recurrent burned areas. Fire frequency
   negatively affected plant structure and basal area; basal area of small,
   medium, and large plants declined significantly by more than 50\% in the
   most frequently burned areas. Richness was positively related to basal
   area in the three times burned sites and in the 16 years regenerating
   site for all strata. Our results demonstrate the negative influence of
   frequent fires on both the composition and structure of small trees in
   Amazonian forest. These changes to the cohort of small-sized trees may
   persist and have long-term impacts on forest structure, affecting the
   capacity, and direction of forest recovery. With wildfire widespread
   across the region and increasing in frequency, fire may negatively
   affect tree diversity in remaining selectively logged forests, and
   affect regional carbon cycling with consequences for the global
   vegetation carbon sink.}},

   differ significantly between streamside and upland zones in the
   watersheds. Fire severity data obtained from aerial photographs were
   highly correlated with fire severity data obtained in the field in six
   of the watersheds, confirming that aerial photograph estimates of live

   studies indicate that fire severity may be lower along perennial
   streams, the results of this study suggest that fire severity in intense
   events may be similar between intermittent stream channels and adjacent
   upland areas. At the landscape scale, differences in fire severity along
   streams of different sizes may influence the mosaic of post fire
   vegetation and contribute to overall structural diversity in forests of

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring landscape-scale vegetation responses of resprouter species to
   wildfire is helpful in explaining post-wildfire recovery. Several
   previous Australian studies have investigated the temporal recovery of
   eucalypt obligate-seeder communities (which have a significantly delayed
   revegetation response), but little research has been conducted for
   resprouter communities. In this study, we found that eucalypt dominated
   resprouter communities in Sydney's drinking water supply catchments
   (SDWC) have a rapid post-wildfire response and recovery rate. This study
   was designed to detect inter-annual landscape-scale changes in
   vegetation response using a 22 yr pre- and post-wildfire time series of
   Landsat satellite-derived Australian summer images (1990/91 to 2011/12).
   Four burned subcatchments and three un-burned subcatchments were
   analyzed. The temporal change in eucalypt forest and woodland vegetation
   communities was examined within the subcatchments using the Normalized
   Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess their health. A new
   spectral index, differenced Recovery Index (dRI), was developed to
   quantify the difference between the pre- and post-wildfire NDVI values.
   We found that, spectrally, at the landscape scale, vegetation
   communities recovered to near pre- wildfire conditions within five to
   seven years post wildfire. These results demonstrate the resilience of
   re-sprouter vegetation communities in the Sydney Basin to large-area
   disturbance events at the landscape scale.}},

   the difference in profile area summarized from pre- and post-fire LiDAR
   points. We applied the PAC method to assess the effects of the 2013
   American Fire in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Our LiDAR PAC
   metrics were compared to changes in commonly used LiDAR-derived canopy
   cover and tree height metrics at tree level, and to Landsat-8
   imagery-derived relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) at
   the 30m pixel level. A quantitative validation using field measured
   changes in basal area and leaf area index (LAI) confirmed that
   correlations between PAC metrics and field measurements (R-2 >= 0.67)
   were significantly higher than those from canopy cover or tree height
   metrics (R-2 <= 0.43), and much stronger than that from RdNBR (R-2 <=
   0.26). The PAC metrics can also be used to infer the extent of tree
   canopy disturbance caused by fire, based on whether the majority of
   biomass loss occurred above or below the tree crown base height. Mapping
   of canopy disturbance indicated that over half (57.0\%) of the American
   Fire region had tree canopy loss from fire, 22.5\% of trees had
   sub-canopy loss, while the remaining area had no detectable tree canopy
   change. Overall, the LiDAR PAC metric, as a simple and integrated
   method, demonstrated promising potential in characterizing fine-grained
   changes in forest structure. The method can be beneficial for forest
   managers in evaluating fire-induced environmental and economic losses,
   and provide useful information for forest restoration design.}},

Abstract = {{Aims We assessed what the effects of fire and grazing are on vegetative
   growth and sexual reproduction of Brachypodium retusum, the dominant
   species of Mediterranean Thero-Brachypodietea grasslands
   ({''}steppes{''}) and on species composition of the associated plant
   community. Location ``La Crau{''}, southeastern France. Methods We set
   up a split-plot experiment testing the effects of fire season (winter,
   summer) and grazing on plant cover, inflorescence number, seed set and
   germination of Brachypodium retusum in traditionally grazed grasslands.
   We further analyzed plant species composition and diversity in
   vegetation releves. The same fire treatments were tested in a second
   experiment in long-term grazing exclosures. Results Brachypodium retusum
   showed a rapid post-fire recovery, but other species of the associated
   plant community, in particular annuals, recovered as fast or even
   faster. Fire increased Brachypodium retusum inflorescence production and
   seed set per inflorescence and this effect was stronger in the summer
   fire treatment. At the community level, fire significantly increased
   species richness, evenness and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in the second
   post-fire season and again, the summer fire effect was stronger. Grazing
   exclusion for two seasons had only a small effect on Brachypodium
   retusum and the associated plant community. The effect of both fire
   treatments on Brachypodium retusum was similar in long-term exclosures.
   In these exclosures, fire resulted in a community shift towards the
   species composition of traditionally grazed steppes. Conclusions The
   concomitant positive effects of experimental burning on Brachypodium
   retusum reproduction and on plant diversity of Mediterranean steppe
   vegetation suggest that the system is adapted to fire as an important
   driver of community composition. Annual species surviving as seeds are
   as successful in post-fire recovery as perennial resprouters. Prescribed
   burning may be an alternative strategy to restore community structure in
   abandoned (ungrazed) steppes showing a decline in typical grassland
   species after several years of grazing abandonment.}},

Abstract = {{While several studies deal with the subject of the impact of fire on
   Mediterranean fauna and subsequent patterns of recolonization, the
   impact of fire on land snail communities has not yet been studied.
   Nevertheless, living in vegetation or in litter, land snails are highly
   sensitive to fire and thus constitute a good model to define the effects
   of fire on fauna. The aims of this study were to analyse the immediate
   and long-term impact of fire on the land snail communities and to reveal
   the patterns of post-fire recolonization within these communities. A
   stratified sampling scheme was carried out, throughout garrigues and
   forests of Provence (France), according to fire age and distances from
   the burned/unburned boundaries and from vegetation refuges. The data
   collected were studied using multivariate statistical analyses
   (Correspondence Analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis and Partial
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis). The main results do not agree with
   the original working hypotheses, i.e. land snail recolonization
   progressing from margins of the burned areas and from vegetation areas
   spared by the fire. The role of burned/unburned boundaries and
   vegetation refuges are not significant. Moreover, although land snail
   communities decrease in diversity and abundance, they are resilient to
   fire perturbation. In fact, one year after a fire all ecological groups
   are represented, which suggests a certain permanence within the
   malacological communities. Thus, the fire mosaic and landscape
   heterogeneity determine numerous scattered refuges that have proved to
   be difficult to locate. Finally, the composition of the post-fire land
   snail communities depends essentially on the habitat structure and, to a
   lesser degree, on their floristic composition and topography.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is known for its potential to profoundly affect nitrogen (N)
   dynamics in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. However, few
   studies have investigated fire effects on several important watershed N
   pools simultaneously or have directly compared effects of spring
   prescribed burns and wildfires that occurred in the same geographic
   area. We simultaneously measured N concentrations in soil, understory
   plant foliage, streamwater, and in-stream moss in paired
   (burned/unburned) headwater watersheds of replicated spring prescribed
   burns and wildfires in several growing seasons after fire.
   Watershed-scale burn severity, estimated via the satellite
   image-derived, reflectance-based delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), was
   significantly higher (P < 0.05) after wildfires than prescribed burns.
   Fire effects were found in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems after
   wildfire but were limited to the terrestrial ecosystem after prescribed
   burns. Soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations were
   increased several-fold (P < 0.05) in burned relative to corresponding
   unburned plots in prescribed burn and wildfire sites. In the first
   post-fire growing season, soil NO3- concentrations in wildfire-burned
   plots were one order of magnitude higher than in prescription-burned
   plots reflecting differences in burn severity. Plants resprouting after
   spring prescribed burns and wildfires sequestered post-fire available
   soil N, as indicated by higher foliar N concentrations. The relative
   increase in foliar N concentrations of four upland understory plant
   species or ecological groups averaged 47\% in burned plots relative to
   unburned plots. Fire effects tended to be strongest and statistically
   significant in the first growing season after fire in the terrestrial
   ecosystem. In the headwater streams, effects of wildfire persisted,
   seemingly unattenuated, throughout the first three growing seasons after
   fire. Streamwater NO3- concentrations were one order of magnitude higher
   in wildfire-burned watersheds than in unburned watersheds and were
   positively correlated with dNBR during spring runoff. In-stream moss N
   concentrations were increased by about 40\% throughout the study period,
   thus representing the aquatic analog to N retention via increased plant
   N uptake. The lack of impact on aquatic N dynamics after spring
   prescribed burning indicated N retention of post-fire available N within
   the terrestrial ecosystem. However, healthy forest ecosystems are
   adapted to periodic pulses of high post-fire availability of inorganic N
   in soil and streams. Therefore, from a N cycling perspective,
   rehabilitation measures are not required after wildfire and managers
   should target higher burn severities for prescribed burning at both the
   plot and watershed scale in order to stimulate N cycling and to reduce
   fuel loads more substantially. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   quantitatively assessed individual tree crowns 8.5 years after a 2009
   wildfire that burnt extensive areas of eucalypt forest in temperate
   Australia. We used airborne LiDAR data validated with field measurements
   to estimate multiple metrics that quantified the cover, density, and
   vertical distribution of individual-tree crowns in 51 plots of 0.05 ha
   in fire-tolerant eucalypt forest across four wildfire severity types
   (unburnt, low, moderate, high). Significant differences in the
   field-assessed mean height of fire scarring as a proportion of tree
   height and in the proportions of trees with epicormic (stem) resprouts
   were consistent with the gradation in fire severity. Linear
   mixed-effects models indicated persistent effects of both moderate and
   high-severity wildfire on tree crown architecture. Trees at
   high-severity sites had significantly less crown projection area and
   live crown width as a proportion of total crown width than those at
   unburnt and low-severity sites. Significant differences in LiDAR-based
   metrics (crown cover, evenness, leaf area density profiles) indicated
   that tree crowns at moderate and high-severity sites were comparatively
   narrow and more evenly distributed down the tree stem. These
   conical-shaped crowns contrasted sharply with the rounded crowns of
   trees at unburnt and low-severity sites and likely influenced both tree
   productivity and the accuracy of biomass allometric equations for nearly
   a decade after the fire. Our data provide a clear example of the utility
   of airborne LiDAR data for quantifying the impacts of disturbances at
   the scale of individual trees. Quantified effects of contrasting fire
   severities on the structure of resprouter tree crowns provide a strong
   basis for interpreting post-fire patterns in forest canopies and
   vegetation profiles in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and other
   remotely-sensed data at larger scales.}},

Abstract = {{Question Fire management practices aimed at biodiversity conservation
   are often in conflict with hazard reduction requirements. Particularly
   in protected areas where such conflict of interest exists, the question
   is asked: what are the ecological thresholds within which fire should be
   managed? Location Montane proteoid fynbos shrublands, eastern coastal
   part of the Cape Floral Kingdom; coastal slopes of the Tsitsikamma and
   Outeniqua Mountains, South Africa. Methods Estimates of optimal fire
   frequencies are often based on the relationship between plant age and
   the rate of seed accumulation of the slowest-maturing species. We
   established juvenile periods and recruitment success (measured as the
   ratio of post-fire recruits to the pre-burn population) after fires at
   different intervals, of serotinous, reseeding shrubs in the Proteaceae.
   From this we estimated minimum fire return intervals (FRIs) that would
   allow for their persistence in eastern coastal fynbos shrublands.
   Results Juvenile periods ranged from 4 to 9 yr, which are comparable to
   ecologically similar proteoids elsewhere in fynbos and SE and SW
   Australian shrublands. There was large variability among sites and
   within species in the degree of flowering at given plant ages, some of
   which seemed related to the moisture regime. There were no consistent
   differences among species in their rate of maturation. Post-fire
   recruitment success was near zero following a fire in 5-yr-old
   vegetation, always above replacement levels following fires in =7-yr-old
   vegetation, and at a maximum in old (38 yr) fynbos. There was
   considerable variation in post-fire recruitment success for any
   particular FRI, species or site. The lack of a significant relationship
   between recruitment success and pre-fire vegetation age, suggests that
   once a critical post-fire age is attained, factors other than seed
   abundance affect recruitment success. Conclusions From an ecological
   perspective, our findings imply a minimum FRI of 9 yr for eastern
   coastal fynbos. This is not intended to prescribe rigid management of
   fire according to a fixed rotation and does not negate the need to
   consider site- or species-specific requirements. Instead it provides a
   lower threshold for a range of acceptable FRIs below which a significant
   decline of species populations is predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Most of fire severity studies use field measures of composite burn index

   However, less attention has been paid on the multi-strata forest fire
   severity, which represents fire activities and ecological responses at
   different forest layers. In this study, using field measured fire
   severity across five forest strata of dominant tree, intermediate-sized
   tree, shrub, herb, substrate layers, and the aggregated measure of CBI
   as response variables, we fit statistical models with predictors of
   Landsat TM bands, Landsat derived NBR or dNBR, image differencing, and

   We explore the potential contributions of the post-fire Landsat bands,
   image differencing, image ratioing to fire severity modeling and compare
   with the widely used NBR and dNBR. Models using combinations of
   post-fire Landsat bands perform much better than NBR, dNBR, image

Abstract = {{Boreal forests store large amounts of organic carbon and are susceptible
   to climate changes, particularly rising temperature, changed soil water
   and increased fire frequency. The young post-fire ecosystems might
   occupy larger proportions of the boreal forests region with the expected
   increases in fire frequency in the future and change the carbon (C)
   balance of this region. However, it is unclear how soil C fluxes in the
   post-fire boreal forest response to the climate changes. Therefore, a
   two-year field experiment was conducted in a boreal forest to
   investigate the effects of fire on the soil C (CO2 and CH4) fluxes and
   the responses of these fluxes to simulated warmer and drier climate
   conditions. The results showed that the boreal forest recovered form
   wildfire 7-8 years had higher soil CO2 flux than the mature forest.
   Furthermore, the treatments of warming, drying and the combination of
   warming and drying increased growing season cumulative soil CO2 flux in
   the post-fire forest by 15.8\%, 20.4\% and 34.2\%, respectively.
   However, the boreal forest soil changed from a weak CH4 source to a weak
   CH4 sink after fire disturbance. Although CH4 absorption increased by
   warming and drying treatments, the interaction of warming and drying led
   to a decrease in soil CH4 uptake. The results indicated that the
   postfire soil showed CO2 and CH4 fluxes with a greater global warming
   potential than before burning and that the global warming potential of
   the soil gas fluxes further increased by warming and drying. The
   predictive power of models of C cycle-climate feedbacks could be
   increased by incorporating the distinct ecosystem following fire with
   permafrost degradation and climate change across the boreal zone. (C)

Abstract = {{Forest managers demand reliable tools to evaluate post-fire vegetation

   mega-wildfire (9000 ha burned) in North-Western Spain, which occurred
   from 21 to 27 August 2017. Burn severity was measured in the field using
   the composite burn index (CBI). Burn severity of vegetation and soil
   layers (CBIveg and CBIsoil) was also differentiated. MaxEnt provided the
   relative contribution of each pre-fire and post-fire input variable on
   low, moderate and high burn severity levels, as well as on all severity
   levels combined (burned area). In addition, it built continuous
   suitability surfaces from which the burned surface area and burn
   severity maps were built. The burned area map achieved a high accuracy
   level (kappa = 0.85), but slightly lower accuracy when differentiating
   the three burn severity classes (kappa = 0.81). When the burn severity
   map was validated using field CBIveg and CBIsoil values we reached lower

Pages = {{2917-2930}},

Abstract = {{The probability of landscape-scale disturbances such as fire are
   expected to increase in the future due to anticipated climate changes
   and past land management practices. These disturbances can produce
   dramatic changes in hydrologic responses (e,g. overland flow) that can
   pose risks to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. Assessing
   these risks and associated remediation strategies requires spatially
   explicit evaluation of upland hydrology. However, most current
   evaluation methods focus on a specified location within a watershed,
   precluding estimation of spatially distributed, upland, hydrological
   response; and those that do consider spatial variability usually do not
   account for redistribution of overland flow among adjacent subunits.
   Here we highlight the use of a spatially distributed model for assessing
   spatial changes in upland hydrologic response following landscape-scale
   disturbance. Using a distributed model called SPLASH (Simulator for
   Processes of Landscapes: Surface/Subsurface Hydrology), we simulated
   pre- and post-fire scenarios based on the Cerro Grande fire (Los Alamos,
   NM, USA; May 2000) over 17 300 ha (resolution of 30 m x 30 m) for 2 year
   and 100 year design storms. For the 2 year storm, maximum overland flow
   rates for burned cells in the post-fire scenario greatly exceeded those
   for pre-fire conditions (modes: pre-fire, 3.25 x 10(-10) m(3) s(-1);
   post-fire, 7.0 x 10(-10) m(3) s(-1)). For the 100 year storm, maximum
   overland flow was much greater than for the 2 year storm (modal
   pre-fire: 31.8 x 10(10) m(3) s(-1)), with the difference between pre-
   and post-fire simulations being less dramatic (modal post-fire: 48.6 x
   10(-10) m(3) s(-1)). Mapped differences between pre- and post-fire
   provide a means for prioritizing upland areas for remediation using an
   approach that accounts not only for topography. soils, and plant cover,
   but also for the redistribution of overland flow. More generally, our
   results highlight the potential utility of spatially distributed models
   to focus and prioritize rehabilitation efforts for future assessments of
   risk following landscape-scale disturbance. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{Post-fire increases of runoff and erosion often occur and land managers

   chaparral hillslopes and the effectiveness of selected mitigation
   treatments. Eight published field study sites were used to compare ERMiT
   predictions with observed sediment deliveries. Most sites experienced
   only a few rainfall events that produced runoff and sediment (1.3-9.2\%)
   except for a California site with a Mediterranean climate (45.6\%). When
   sediment delivery occurred, pooled Spearman rank correlations indicated
   significant correlations between the observed sediment delivery and

   rho = 0.59 for the log erosion barriers and rho = 0.27 (not significant)

Abstract = {{Measurements of post-fire sediment erosion, transport, and deposition

   Annual post-fire sediment yields were computed and grouped into four
   measurement methods (hillslope point and plot measurements, channel
   measurements of suspended-sediment and sediment erosion or deposition
   volumes). Post-fire sediment yields for each method were then grouped
   into eight different rainfall regimes. Mean sediment yield from channels
   (240 t ha(-1)) was significantly greater than from hillslopes (82 t
   ha(-1)). This indicated that on the time scale of wildfire (10-100
   years) channels were the primary sources of available sediment. A lack
   of correlation of sediment yield with topographic slope and soil
   erodibility further suggested that sediment availability may be more
   important than slope or soil erodibility in predicting post-fire
   sediment yields. The maximum post-fire sediment yields were comparable
   to long-term sediment yields from major rivers of the world. Based on 80

   Rhodes Island, Greece. Fire history was defined by fire frequency and

   species richness and abundance per guild between fire-history regimes

   observed no significant variation in the abundance of the common species
   of bees, the most prominent pollinator group, implying that provision of
   pollination services may not be considerably affected by fire.
   Long-unburnt sites displayed higher heterogeneity in species composition
   compared to recently-burnt sites (either burnt once or twice). This
   pattern deviated significantly from null expectations when analyzing the
   abundance-based metric of beta-diversity and was obscure in the case of
   the presence/absence-based metric, indicating that fire affected mainly
   the spatial distribution of individuals, i.e. the main change is not due

   the species composition in recently-burnt sites (burnt once in 2008)

Abstract = {{To determine the importance of different fire variables in promoting ant
   diversity in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, ants were studied
   in savanna grassland patches of different post-fire fuel age, and fire
   frequency. Pitfall traps were set in six grassland sites representing
   three fire regimes (1: young (<24 months post-fire) and frequently
   burned; 2: young and infrequently burned; 3: old (4 and 6 years
   post-fire) and infrequently burned). Species richness declined with
   decreasing fire influence, being greatest on young and frequently burned
   plots, and lowest on old and infrequently burned plots. There was
   pronounced dominance by a few species on young and infrequently burned
   plots, and greater equitability at other sites. Ant diversity appears to
   be influenced more by post-fire fuel age than frequency of burning,
   although there is a need for a wider range of fire frequencies and
   greater replication to explore this further. Species richness was
   inversely correlated with the proportion of foliage biomass at ground
   level. Southern African ant communities may be quite resilient to
   differences in fire regime, and only a limited amount of fire diversity
   (young us old patches) may be necessary to maintain ant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire vegetation regeneration was studied for a 6-year period in a
   13-year-old-artificial forest consisting of Larix kaempferi with a dense
   undergrowth of Sasa senanensis. The study site was classified into three
   fire severity categories according to the degree of Sasa senanensis
   scorching, that is, a high-severity category, a mid-severity category,
   and a low-severity category. Study plots were established in areas which
   fitted the criteria for each category, and in nearby unburned sites. A
   total of 41 woody species were newly emerged during the 6-year study
   period in the burned and unburned plots. Only a few seedlings and
   resprouts emerged in the unburned plots, while many seedlings emerged in
   the high-severity plots from the first year after fire onward. A
   high-severity fire that burns the rhizomes of Sasa is necessary for the
   vegetation recovery by germination of seed. Whereas the establishment of
   seedlings was restricted to a few years after fire, the regeneration
   through resprouting continued into the last year of observation. The
   survival time of resprouts was longer than that of seedlings, and the
   survival time of shade-tolerant species was longer than that of
   shade-intolerant species. In contrast, shade-intolerant species grew
   more rapidly than shade-tolerant species. The plants' ability to exceed
   the maximum height of the Sasa before the bamboo recovers can be
   critical to the survival of shade-intolerant species. Because resprouts
   have a stronger resistance to the shade of Sasa than seedlings, the
   resprouts of shade-tolerant species play a major role in the
   re-establishment of woody species after fire in sites with considerable
   Sasa ground-cover.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted in a fire-prone region in the Greater Xing'an
   Mountains, the primary forested area of northeastern China. We measured
   soil respiration and the affecting soil factors, i.e., soil microbial
   biomass and soil moisture, within an experimental plot of Larix gmelinii
   Rupr. A low-intensity, prescribed fire was applied as the treatment.
   Traditional descriptive statistics and geostatistics were used to
   analyze the spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and the response
   of respiration to fire disturbance. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for
   pre-fire and post-fire soil respiration were 23.4 and 32.0 \%,
   respectively. CVs for post-fire soil respiration increased
   significantly, with a moderate variation of all CVs. Soil respiration
   pre-fire was significantly correlated with soil microbial biomass
   carbon, biomass nitrogen, and soil moisture (W); post-fire soil
   respiration was not correlated with these factors. From the
   geostatistical analyses, the C-0 + C (sill) for post-fire soil
   respiration increased significantly, indicating that the post-fire
   spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration increased significantly. The
   nugget effect (nc) of soil respiration and the affecting factors
   pre-fire and post-fire disturbance were in the range of 12.5-50 \%, with
   strong spatial autocorrelation. Fire disturbance changed the components
   of spatial heterogeneity, and the proportion of functional heterogeneity
   increased significantly post-fire. The ranges (a) for pre-fire and
   post-fire soil respiration were 81.0 and 68.2 m, respectively. The
   homogeneity of the distribution of post-fire soil respiration decreased
   and the spatial heterogeneity increased, thus the range for post-fire
   soil respiration decreased significantly. The fractal dimension (D) for
   soil respiration increased post-fire, the spatial heterogeneity of soil
   respiration affected by random components increased, indicating that the
   change in spatial heterogeneity of post-fire soil respiration should be
   considered within the scale of the forest stand. Following Kriging
   interpolation, the increase in the patchiness of post-fire soil
   respiration was illustrated using a contour map. Based on these
   preliminary results, the change in the spatial heterogeneity of
   post-fire soil respiration was likely caused by changes in the
   distribution of soil moisture and microbial activity within the
   experimental plot at the scale of the forest stand.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated how fire impacts the ecological coherence of Aleppo pine
   forests and their biodiversity over a 40-year period. The study area
   forms part of an insular ecosystem of Zakynthos Island (Zante) in
   western Greece, which forms part of the Ionian Islands. Post-fire
   effects were studied for both plant and bird diversity at 20 sampling
   plots, using stratified random sampling, during the summer of 2012. The
   plots were selected based on the frequency of burning since the 1970s.
   Sites were categorized as: 1) no burning for >40 years, 2) burnt once in
   the 1970s, 3) burnt twice, first in the 1970s and again in 2000-2010, 4)
   burnt three times, first in the 1970s. and twice more in 2000-2010, and
   5) burnt four times, first in the1970s, twice more in 2000-2010. and
   again in 2011. A total of 79 plant species and 26 bird species were
   recorded at the studied sites. One-way ANOVA analysis showed that fire
   intensity has a significant impact on alpha floristic diversity. Average
   plant species richness at sites that burned in 2011 was significantly
   higher than in those that burned in the 1970s. Detected differences in
   bird species richness were not significant; however, more species were
   documented in the forested habitats (unburnt for >40 years, and burnt in
   the 1970s). The highest Jaccard similarity index was observed between
   the sites that had not burned for more than 40 years and the sites that
   burned in the 1970s. The lowest floristic similarity to non-burnt sites
   was observed between the recently burnt sites in 2011 and the sites that
   burned in the 1970s. The lowest bird similarity was detected between
   recently burnt sites in 2011 and sites that had not burned for more than
   40 years. DCA ordination showed the presence of a clear fire gradient,
   from intensively burnt open sites to non-burnt forest sites. We suggest
   that fire is essential to maintain biodiversity in Aleppo pine forests,

Abstract = {{Browsing by exotic mule deer on Santa Catalina Island (SCI) off the

   native shrublands. To assess this, deer exclosures were established
   following a wildfire to monitor post-fire recovery of three dominant,
   native shrub species (Heteromeles arbutifolia, Rhus integrifolia, and
   Rhamnus pirifolia). Post-fire resprout growth, mortality, and tissue
   water status as well as pre- and post-fire shrub density and cover were
   measured inside and outside of deer exclosures. We found that deer
   browsing significantly limited post-fire resprout growth and led to
   increased mortality of resprouting H. arbutifolia shrubs (88 \%
   mortality outside compared to 11 \% inside exclosures). Post-fire
   resprouts maintained favorable water status during the study despite
   drought conditions, indicating that water stress was not a proximate
   cause of resprout mortality. Deer browsing resulted in a > 93 \%
   reduction in canopy coverage of dominant shrub species. The dramatic
   reduction of native shrubs at this site may create opportunities for
   displacement by exotic species, resulting in eventual vegetation-type
   conversion. The observed link between intense browsing and post-fire
   shrub mortality provides much needed information concerning the

Abstract = {{Mediterranean forests are especially prone to fire, a periodic
   disturbance that affects all the ecosystem components in different ways.
   Gathering knowledge on the particular responses and rate of recovery of
   multiple ecosystem components following a wildfire is crucial to
   reliably evaluate its consequences on biodiversity. Using eight sampling
   transects, we studied the changes in four ecosystem components (topsoil,
   plants, carabids, and staphylinids) during three years after a spring
   wildfire in a Quercus pyrenaica forest; and compared them with the
   surrounding unburnt forest (hereafter control). We found great variety
   of responses to fire suggesting each component may deal with this
   recurring disturbance via different adaptations, and that the time spent
   to recover to pre-disturbance conditions depends on the group of focus.
   Topsoil characteristics were highly variable and minor differences were
   found between burnt and control transects. Plant community was
   considerably affected by fire but rapidly recovered exceeding the
   control forest in species richness and cover, partly due to
   proliferation of annual herbs. However, plant species composition
   differed between burnt and control forests during the whole study
   period. Carabid beetles were more abundant and richer in species in the
   burnt forest, thanks to the arrival of seed predators favoured by
   post-fire drier and warmer conditions. Staphylinid beetle composition
   differed between control and burnt transects during the whole period,
   although their abundance was strongly variable. Distinct post-fire
   plant, carabid and staphylinid species composition suggests scattered
   low-intensity wildfires in this region may help to maintain habitat
   heterogeneity benefiting biodiversity at the landscape scale.}},

Title = {{An assessment of climate, weather, and fuel factors influencing a large,
   destructive wildfire in the Knysna region, South Africa}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: In June 2017, wildfires burned 15 000 ha around the town of
   Knysna in the Western Cape, destroying > 800 buildings, > 5000 ha of
   forest plantations, and claiming the lives of seven people. We examined
   the factors that contributed to making this one of the worst fires on
   record in the region.
   Results: One third of the area that burned was in natural vegetation
   (mainly fynbos shrublands), and more than half was in plantations of
   invasive alien (non-native) pine trees, or in natural vegetation invaded
   by alien trees. We used satellite imagery to assess burn severity in
   different land cover types by comparing pre- and post-fire images to
   estimate biomass consumed. We used daily weather data from two weather
   stations to calculate fire danger and drought indices over 70 years, and
   compared the fire weather conditions during the 2017 Knysna fires to the
   long-term weather record. The amount of biomass consumed was
   significantly higher in plantations of invasive alien trees, and in
   fynbos invaded by alien trees, than in uninvaded fynbos, providing
   support for the contention that invasion by alien trees increases the
   impact and difficulty of control of wildfires. Fire danger indices on
   the days of the fires were in the top 0.1 to 0.2\% of days in the
   historic record, indicating that fire weather conditions were extreme
   but not unprecedented. The fires were preceded by a prolonged drought,
   and 18-month running means for two drought indices were the highest on
   record.
   Conclusion: The severity of the fires was exacerbated by very high fire
   danger conditions, preceded by an unprecedented drought, and further
   worsened by the conversion of natural fynbos vegetation to plantations,
   and invasion of vegetation by alien trees. Historical fire suppression
   also resulted in fuel buildups, further aggravating the problem of fire
   control, while residential development within and adjacent to fire-prone
   areas increased the risks faced by residents. Our results support calls
   to control invasive alien plants, reduce commercial planting of invasive
   alien trees, strictly regulate development in areas of high fire risk,
   and maintain awareness of the need for fire-wise practices.}},

   boreal forest}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Burn severity (ecological impacts of fire on vegetation and soils)
   influences post-fire stand structure and species composition. The
   spatial pattern of burn severity may compound the ecological impacts of
   fire through distances to seed sources and availability of bud banks and
   seedbeds. Land managers require spatial burn severity data to manage
   post-fire risks, ecosystem recovery, and assess the outcomes of fires.
   This research seeks to characterize and explain variability in burn
   severity in the northwestern boreal forest. We assessed burn severity
   one year post-fire in six large wildfires that burned in 2014. We
   measured burn severity using the Composite Burn Index, surface Burn
   Severity Index, Canopy Fire Severity Index, and percent overstory
   mortality, describing a range of surface and overstory fire effects.
   Burn severity was variable, ranging from unburned residuals to complete
   overstory mortality and intense combustion. We related field
   measurements to remotely sensed multispectral burn severity metrics of
   the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), the Relativized dNBR, and
   the Relativized Burn Ratio. Diagnostic models of burn severity using
   relativized metrics had lower errors and better (though not
   significantly so) fits to the field data. Spatial patterns of burn
   severity were consistent with those observed in other large fires in
   North America. Stand-replacing patches were large, aggregated, and
   covered the largest proportion of the landscape. These patterns were not
   consistent across the four mapped burn severity field metrics,
   suggesting such metrics may be viewed as related, but complementary, as
   they depict different aspects of severity. Prognostic models indicated
   burn severity was explained by pre-fire stand structure and composition,
   topoedaphic context, and fire weather at time of burning. Wetlands
   burned less severely than uplands, and open stands with high basal areas
   experienced lower burn severity in upland vegetation communities. This
   research offers an enhanced understanding of the relationship between
   ground observations and remotely sensed severity metrics, in conjunction
   with stand-level drivers of burn severity. The diverse fuel complexes
   and extreme fire weather during the 2014 fire season produced the
   complex patterns and broad range of burn severity observed.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{716}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{In November 2016, the urban dry streams (wadis) of the city of Haifa in
   Northern Israel were on fire. However, it was not just the fire that was
   threatening urban areas. Post-fire precipitation could turn into urban
   floods, further aggravating the fire damages. Several months after the
   fire a considerable restoration effort was initiated to restore the
   burned areas and mitigate future events. For urban forests the
   rehabilitation strategy was planned and implemented according to the
   topographic structure of the burned site and anticipated soil erosion.
   Accordingly, various post-fire management techniques were used:
   salvage-logging, afforestation, log erosion barriers and coconut
   fibre-webs. This study aimed to look at the effects of these methods on
   soil properties, namely, gravimetrical soil moisture, soil organic
   matter content, pH, electrical conductivity, hydraulic conductivity and
   soil water repellency. Results indicate that the control (burned,
   non-managed) site was the highest in soil moisture, organic matter and
   electrical conductivity compared to all other sites, however, the
   existence of ash cover made the response to precipitation unpredictable.
   The hydraulic conductivity (K) of the black ash (24.1 +/- 8.6 mm/h), the
   white ash (19.0 +/- 10.7 mm/h) and the disturbed (mixed) ash (11.7 +/-
   3.7 mm/h) were significantly higher than the underlying soil (3.3 +/-
   0.7 mm/h). As a result of these differences in K value, precipitation
   only infiltrates through the ash layers and then flows along the
   interface of the ash and the soil, triggering soil erosion. Most of the
   sites that were salvage logged showed signs of erosion. The log barriers
   were only effective for downstream areas. The afforestation could help
   to homogenise the soil, but the vegetation cover would be less dense and
   stable than after natural reforestation. Furthermore, the coconut fibre
   webs helped to improve the soil water retention and decreased the direct
   impact of rainfall. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the role of fire in degrading tropical dry forest
   ecosystems of north-east Africa, fire potential was studied within two

   behaviour was analysed in experimental fires late in the dry season

   on samples taken before and after fire treatment. Bark thickness was
   also measured, as an indication of fire-resistance, on a suit of
   tree/shrub species representing the two vegetation types and an ecotone
   between them. The total fuel biomass differed only marginally between
   the two vegetation types. But biomass of the litter fuel differed
   significantly, and the biomass of litter fuel was two times greater in
   the Acacia woodland (673 g m(-2)) than in the dry Afromontane forest
   (308 g m(-2)). In contrast, the biomass of woody fine fuels was four
   times greater in the dry Afromontane forest (300 g m(-2)) than in the
   Acacia woodland (76 g m- 2) and the biomass of live fine fuels was also
   several times greater in the dry Afromontane forest (110 g

   a gradual increase in bark thickness of trees when going from the dry
   Afromontane forest over the ecotone towards the Acacia woodland site.
   Considering all species analysed, bark thickness of trees 15 cm in
   diameter at I m height ranged from 2.4 to 15.4 mm. Therefore, based on
   the differences in microclimate, fuels, fire behaviour and bark
   thickness the Acacia woodland was determined to be the most fire prone
   as well as fire resilient ecosystem. In contrast, sustained combustion
   was unlikely at the studied dry Afromontane forest site. Spread of fire
   was not possible due to the high fuel moisture content and poor fuel
   bed. Forest fragmentation and intentional burning of grasslands,
   followed by an altered microclimate, should however increase the
   probability of fires penetrating the dry Afromontane forest. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A rare, stand-replacing fire in northern Minnesota, USA provided the
   opportunity to compare the effects of wildfire and timber harvesting in
   two peatland forest communities, nutrient-poor black spruce (Picea
   mariana) bogs (BSB) and nutrient-rich tamarack (Larix laricina) swamps
   (RTS). We found the response between the two communities and their
   corresponding vegetation to be highly sensitive to different types and
   severity of disturbance, ranging from modest shifts in ground layer
   vascular plants and bryophyte species abundance, to wholesale plant
   community transformation resulting from the removal of the upper peat
   surface. Fire had a positive influence on black spruce regeneration
   within BSB sites, particularly areas experiencing lower levels of fire
   severity, with seedling densities significantly higher than harvest and
   control areas. Our results also suggest that ecosystem recovery will be
   rapid after low severity fire in these areas, given that localized areas
   of peat combustion created suitable microsites for black spruce seedling
   establishment ensuring this species will remain a component of the
   post-fire communities. In contrast, tamarack regeneration was only
   documented in harvested RTS sites. For BSB, there was spatial
   heterogeneity in peat consumption as a result of fire behavior
   interacting with varying moisture conditions throughout peat hummocks
   and hollows. Light to moderate burning created suitable black spruce
   seedbeds by reducing cover of Sphagnum moss and the dominant ericaceous
   shrub Rhododendron groenlandicum, and increasing the cover of pioneering
   mosses, such as Polytrichum strictum. In RTS sites, fire typically
   consumed the entire upper peat surface, resulting in homogenization of
   community composition and retrogression towards marsh-like conditions
   dominated by cattails (Typha spp.). These findings underscore the
   importance of accounting for post-fire microsite heterogeneity when
   developing silvicultural systems for emulating natural disturbance
   processes in conifer forests with a naturally accumulated surface peat
   layer. In addition, the state shifts observed in areas experiencing high
   severity fire suggest that increases in fire frequency and severity may
   create significant challenges to maintaining forested conditions in
   these areas, particularly in RTS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   zones of greater fire severity, which can be explained by the lower
   emissivity of combustion products found in the burned area and changes
   in the energy balance related to vegetation removal. As time progresses
   over the 27 months after fire, LST differences decrease due to
   vegetation regeneration. The differences in LST and Normalized

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Uncontrolled wildfire in arid and semiarid ecosystems has become an
   increasing concern in recent decades. Active rehabilitation of
   fire-affected areas is often quickly initiated to minimize long-term
   ecosystem damage. However, the complex soil-geomorphic-vegetation
   patterns and low and variable moisture conditions in these regions makes
   restoration challenging. To further inform these post-fire management
   decisions, we present results from 5 years of vegetation and sediment
   flux monitoring following the Milford Flat Fire in west-central Utah,
   USA. Our sampling design includes monitoring plots in areas not burned,
   areas burned but where no rehabilitation was attempted, and burned areas
   where various rehabilitation approaches were implemented. At each of the
   25 plots, vegetation cover and composition data were collected annually,
   and wind-driven sediment flux was measured using passive dust traps. To
   evaluate effectiveness of post-fire rehabilitation treatments in
   establishing desired species and limiting dominance of undesired
   species, we analyzed the temporal response of individual species and
   functional groups as well as community-level multivariate responses. The
   warm and dry conditions that persisted for approximately 12 months
   post-treatment, coupled with the surface disturbing rehabilitation
   approaches used, resulted in near-surface dust fluxes several orders of
   magnitude higher in treated areas than in unburned or burned areas where
   no rehabilitation occurred. These dry conditions and high surface
   sediment flux limited the establishment of seeded species in
   rehabilitation areas for nearly 3 years. Post-fire rehabilitation did
   not limit dominance by invasive annual species of concern. Perennial
   species composition in the areas burned but not subject to post-fire
   rehabilitation was relatively similar to unburned throughout the study
   period. In contrast, the burned plots where rehabilitation was attempted
   were characterized by no (<3\%) perennial cover or, in response to
   moister conditions, seeded forage species. These results suggest the
   post-fire rehabilitation efforts conducted in the lower elevation
   regions affected by the Milford Flat Fire were not generally successful.
   Though dry conditions are likely to blame for the lack of success, the
   low and variable precipitation characteristic of these regions suggest
   future post-fire rehabilitation decisions must assume that precipitation
   is going to be insufficient and plan rehabilitation efforts that are
   resilient to dry conditions.}},

Title = {{Habitat-dependent responses of terrestrial salamanders to wildfire in
   the short-term}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{449}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important natural disturbance event that promotes
   landscape heterogeneity and regulates many wildlife communities. The
   compounding effects of fire suppression and climate change have
   increased the frequency and severity of wildfire, but the responses of
   many organisms to wildfire is unknown. Landscape heterogeneity,
   specifically microhabitats, may mediate and buffer the effects of
   wildfire, and evaluating variable responses to wildfire given habitat is
   key to developing a more cohesive understanding of population responses.
   Terrestrial plethodontid salamanders are likely disproportionality
   affected by wildfire events because of their lungless anatomy and
   reliance on cool and moist habitats. Our knowledge of salamander
   responses to wildfire in the short-term is limited due to the inherent
   challenge of opportunistically studying post-wildfire events. We
   capitalized on a wildfire event in western North Carolina, USA to
   determine the short-term (6-18-month postfire) habitat-mediated
   responses of salamanders to wildfire using body size measurement and
   repeated count surveys. We observed precipitous declines of the
   red-legged salamander, Plethodon shermani, in exposed upland forests,
   but no apparent negative effects in riparian forests 18-months post-fire
   relative to unburned sites. We also observed a loss of juvenile size
   classes in the upland burned forest with only the largest adult
   individuals remaining 18-months post-fire. There were no size class
   differences in the riparian forests. Our results suggest riparian
   forests may be buffered from the effects of wildfire because canopy
   cover, vegetation, and soil duff layer are retained following a wildfire
   event. Salamander populations inhabiting riparian forests may be at less
   risk of declining than those in exposed habitats. Our results underscore
   the need to assess wildfire effects in all habitat types to fully
   determine the effects of disturbance to populations.}},

Abstract = {{Although fire is an intrinsic factor in most terrestrial biomes, it is
   often perceived as a negative disturbance that must be suppressed. The
   application of successful fire prevention policies can lead to
   unsustainable fire events for ecosystems adapted to a specific fire

   fire parameters and ecosystem services. Consequently, adaptive forest
   and landscape management must include knowledge on vulnerability,
   resistance and resilience of terrestrial ecosystems. To help address
   this need, we convened a special issue (divided in two separate parts)
   to synthesise ongoing research focused on obtaining a better
   understanding of wildfire response decisions and actions, including
   preventive management and post-fire restoration. We conceived a
   collection of research studies covering a wide diversity of geographical
   settings characterised by different climates and forest types, under
   scenarios of changing climate and land use. Here, we summarise the key
   findings from the six papers published in the first section of the
   special issue. They deal with diverse topics and assessments, such as
   adaptions to fire regimes, the effects of burn severity on the
   plant-soil interface, and post-fire management taking advantage of

Abstract = {{The east coast forest fires of April 2000 were Korea's largest recorded
   fires. This, along with the fact that they took place in the region most
   frequently affected by fire, attracted a great deal of attention. Due to
   the variations in wind, topography and pre-fire forest stands, a
   heterogeneous landscape mosaic of burn severity was created across the
   region. It turned out to be an excellent opportunity to study various
   landscape-scale impacts of fires on forest dynamics. Therefore, we
   investigated stands in the 23 794 ha of burned forest region, in terms
   of burn severity, vegetation regeneration and forested landscape change
   as a measure of community stability. Using the geographic information
   system technique, we analyzed the differential severity and post-fire
   recovery of pre-fire forest types of different stand age both at stand
   and species level. Analysis showed that pre-fire vegetation was composed
   of mainly pine (Pinus densiflora) stands that occupied 70\% of the whole
   forested area, while pine-hardwood and hardwood stands occupied only
   28\% and 3\%, respectively. In addition, two-thirds of all stands were
   less than 30-years-old. Pine stands were the most severely burned, while
   conversely pine-hardwood and hardwood stands were less vulnerable. This
   implied that pine forests had fire-prone characteristics. Vegetation
   recovery went the opposite way; that is, the regenerating vegetation
   cover was 71\% at pre-fire hardwood stands, and 65\% and 53\% at
   pine-hardwood and pine stands, respectively. However, these recovery
   rates were strikingly fast, considering that investigation took place
   about 3 months after the fires. Fire did not initiate successional
   processes, but tended to accelerate the predicted successional changes
   by releasing pre-fire understory species that survived the fires and
   regenerated by sprouting. The dominant pre-fire tree species (P.
   densiflora) was susceptible to fire and not resilient enough to
   reestablish in competition with oak species. Contrary to pines, the
   abilities of oak species, mainly Quercus mongolica and Q. variabilis, to
   survive fires and to resprout vigorously made them dominant at most
   post-fire stands. These shifts in species abundance caused drastic
   changes to the landscape: from pine-dominated to oak-dominated stands
   without any notable change in species composition. The patterns in
   forest regeneration that we observed in Korea may be representative of
   forest responses to any long-term repeated disturbances, including fire.}},

Abstract = {{There are 195 vertebrate species occurring in mountain pine beetle
   (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) infested areas in interior British
   Columbia that will likely be impacted by beetle control measures. The
   effects of these measures on wildlife will depend on whether they
   increase or decrease the availability of critical habitat attributes
   such as large trees, dead and dying trees, down wood, shrubby
   undergrowth, continuous canopy cover, and deciduous trees. Shifting the
   forest age class distribution to early seral stages to reduce landscape
   susceptibility to mountain pine beetle attack will harm many wildlife
   species that are dependent on mature forest conditions, but will benefit
   the few species that thrive in more open habitats. In contrast, the
   conversion of lodgepole pine forests to non-pine tree species, and fall
   and burn treatments, should have relatively minor impacts. The effects
   of many beetle control measures on wildlife will devolve to the effects
   of tree retention level on wildlife. Manipulating the tree retention
   level, and the size, location and dispersion pattern of residual trees
   and tree patches can significantly advance wildlife management goals. We
   conclude this paper by suggesting potential approaches to integrating

Abstract = {{To implement adaptive management in post-fire-regenerated Aleppo pine
   forests, we developed specific biomass equations in two early-thinned
   climatically contrasting stands. We found thinning enlarged biomass
   components, although climate primarily constrained biomass accumulation
   and biomass allocation.
   The increase in burnt surface by wildfires in the Mediterranean Basin
   has triggered the proliferation of large unmanaged forested areas,
   particularly Aleppo pine stands in drier and lower altitudinal areas.
   These young naturally regenerated stands require specific biomass models
   for accurate carbon stock quantification.
   The aim of this study is to analyse the effects of climate (dry vs.
   semiarid), age and forest management (early thinning) on biomass
   accumulation and biomass allocation of young Pinus halepensis
   components: stem, crown (crown wood, needles and cones) and roots.
   We sampled 251 individual Aleppo pine trees across an age sequence of
   5-16 years old to develop component biomass equations.
   We observed that biomass allocation differed with climate, age and tree
   density. The crown was the largest biomass fraction, followed by root
   fraction and stem fraction. At the most limiting site (semiarid
   climate), we found major reproductive efforts, which may be shaped by
   adaptive traits to recurrent fires or recurrent drought episodes.
   Climate was the first limiting factor to constrain biomass accumulation
   and biomass allocation. Thinning played a key role in promoting positive
   effects on biomass components at both sites, which were enlarged under
   less stressful site conditions (dry climate). These results may help
   managers understand how altering stand density promotes more resilient
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation restoration in strongly degraded lands has inherent
   limitations Among the most relevant limitations in Mediterranean
   Mountains are severe drought and stressful levels of irradiance during
   summer Thus, it is common that seedlings planted in open ground incur
   high rates of early mortality. In the context of a project of
   restoration of a burned area in Southern Spain. we evaluate the
   efficiency of watering and enrichment with native soil, and the
   influence of seedling age on survival and growth of 9 late-successional
   tall shrubs and trees planted in open ground. We also explore how
   small-scale variation in environmental variables relates to
   establishment success Our results show an overall positive effect of
   watering on the survival of planted seedlings, while the effects of
   enrichment with native soil and age of planted seedlings were
   species-specific. Seedling establishment varied markedly with the
   presence of ravines, which duplicated seedling survival. This suggests
   that ravines may be more easily restored, improving their role as
   corridors in landscape designs of restoration. Independently of the
   treatment applied. Rosa sp and Crataegus monogyna, both fleshy-fruited
   species, had the highest rates of establishment. In conclusion, this
   study shows the viability of low aggressive restoration techniques to
   assist vegetation recovery in fire-degraded environments Specifically,
   watering and planting in ravines should be considered where restoration
   practices are applied in areas lacking vegetation cover. Some species
   highly attractive for animal dispersers and of easy establishment (Rosa

Abstract = {{This paper documents the existence and character of a little known
   fire-maintained anthropogenic ecosystem in the southeastern Olympic
   Peninsula of Washington State, U.S.A. Due to cessation of anthropogenic
   burning, there is no longer an intact example of this ecosystem. We
   present evidence from Skokomish oral tradition, historical documents,
   floral composition, tree-ring analysis, stand structure, and site
   potential to describe former savanna structure and function. We believe
   this system was a mosaic of prairies, savannas, and woodlands in a
   forest matrix maintained through repeated burning to provide culturally
   important plants and animals. The overstory was dominated by Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Bear grass (Xerophyllum tenax) likely was a
   dominant understory component of the savannas, woodlands, and prairie
   edges. These lands grew forests in the absence of anthropogenic burning.
   Wide spacing of older trees or stumps in former stands and rapid
   invasion by younger trees in the late 1800s and early 1900s suggest a
   sudden change in stand structure. Shade-intolerant prairie species are
   still present where openings have been maintained but not in surrounding
   forests. Bark charcoal, fire scars, tree establishment patterns, and
   oral traditions point to use of fire to maintain this system. A common
   successional trajectory for all these lands leads to forested
   vegetation. These findings suggest that frequent application of
   prescribed burning would be necessary to restore this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of dense populations of red and fallow deer on a
   burned Mediterranean plant community in Portugal. We sampled a set of 12
   open and 12 fenced plots 2, 3, 4, and 8 years after fire occurrence.
   Each plot was sub-sampled using a quadrat grid to estimate the relative
   plant frequency (proportion of quadrats with plants). The effect of deer
   on temporal trends of overall plant frequency and diversity, and on the
   abundance of the four most common woody species, was modeled using
   Generalized Linear Mixed Models. The effect of deer on plant assemblage
   composition was assessed by use of Redundancy Analysis. In open plots
   the relative plant frequency increased along the study period from 0.59
   to 0.85, whereas in fenced plots there was a significantly faster
   recovery from 0.35 to 0.96. Cistus salvifolius and Rubus ulmifolius were
   significantly favored by fencing but a similar effect was not observed
   for Erica scoparia and Ulex jussiaei. The Redundancy Analysis showed a
   divergent floristic composition of the two sets of plots. The effect of
   deer was significant for the Evenness index but not for the Shannon and
   the Richness indices. Our results show that a high deer density may
   significantly delay the post-fire recovery of a Mediterranean community
   of woody plants and cause shifts in the direction of plant succession.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have addressed the importance of woodpeckers as
   ecological engineers in forests due to their excavation of cavities.
   Although research in green, unburned forests has identified the
   influence of different excavators on secondary use by cavity-dependent
   species, little is known about the relative importance of cavities
   created by woodpeckers in recently burned forests. By excavating
   cavities, woodpeckers create habitat for secondary cavity users that can
   facilitate post-fire regeneration through seed dispersal, seed
   germination and regulation of insect populations that affect vegetative
   growth. In this study, we monitored 77 cavities created by three species
   of Picoides woodpeckers for use by secondary cavity species in a fire
   that burned in the Sierra Nevada, California. At each cavity we measured
   nest tree and site-specific parameters to determine if these
   characteristics could explain differential use by secondary cavity
   users. We found substantial overlap in cavity characteristics between
   woodpecker species, with the white-headed woodpecker differing most
   notably in their placement of cavities in larger diameter, shorter and
   more decayed trees in less dense stands than either hairy or
   black-backed woodpeckers. These differences in cavity placement may have
   resulted in the high diversity and large number of detections of
   secondary cavity species in white-headed woodpecker cavities.
   Black-backed and hairy woodpeckers were similar in the number of
   detections of secondary cavity use, although black-backed woodpecker
   cavities were used by more species than hairy woodpecker cavities.
   Secondary cavity use was high (86\%) suggesting these woodpeckers, and
   the white-headed woodpecker in particular, can have an accelerating
   affect effect on ecological succession by providing valuable habitat
   features for seed dispersing birds and mammals, insectivorous birds, and
   small predators, thereby impacting ecological processes and functions.}},

Abstract = {{As remote sensing mapping products representing important habitat
   components increase in availability, detail, and accuracy, new
   opportunities arise to map predicted habitat for forest species of
   conservation concern. One such species is the Lewis's woodpecker which
   is a species of conservation interest in multiple states and throughout
   its range in British Columbia, Canada with habitat loss and degradation
   proposed as contributing factors in the species decline. The purpose of
   this study was to model and map Lewis's woodpecker nesting habitat using
   primary (directly derived) and secondary (modeled using ground
   calibration data) remote sensing products, as well as contribute to the
   knowledge of nesting ecology for the species in a source habitat type.
   We found promise in the utility of lidar and Landsat time series modeled
   snag and shrub products in conjunction with additional lidar structure
   and topographic metrics for predicting nesting habitat for the Lewis's
   woodpecker across a post-fire landscape. Our selected model had a
   percent correctly classified rate of 83.3\% and contained additional
   variables (variability in canopy cover and topographic slope) to those
   included in the Fish and Wildlife Service habitat suitability model
   (HSM) for the species (canopy cover, shrub cover, and density of large
   snags). We were able to apply the remote sensing products to map
   realized habitat relationships for this species of conservation concern

Abstract = {{This review was to determine a standard post-fire restoration strategy
   for use in South Korea according to the magnitude of the damage and the
   condition of the affected site. The government has strongly enforced
   reforestation in deforested areas as well as fire prevention and
   suppression since the 1960s. These efforts have successfully recovered
   dense even-aged forests over the last five decades. However, high fuel
   loading and the homogeneous structure have made forests vulnerable to
   large fires. In recent years, large forest fires have occurred in the
   eastern coastal region of Korea. Forest fires can significantly
   influence the economic and social activities of the residents of such
   affected forest regions. Burned areas may require urgent and long-term
   restoration strategies, depending on the condition of the affected site.
   Erosion control is the most important component of an urgent restoration
   and should be completed before a rainy season to prevent secondary
   damage such as landslides and sediment runoff in burned areas. Long-term
   restoration is necessary to renew forest functions such as timber
   production, water conservation, ecosystem conservation, and recreation
   for residents. Sound restoration for burned areas is critical for
   restoring healthy ecological functions of forests and providing economic

Abstract = {{We tested whether post-fire seedling establishment of common boreal tree
   and expanding shrub species at treeline and in Arctic tundra is
   facilitated by co-migration of boreal forest mycorrhizal fungi.
   Wildfires are anticipated to facilitate biome shifts at the
   forest-tundra ecotone by improving seedbed conditions for recruiting
   boreal species; at the same time fire alters the composition and
   availability of mycorrhizal fungi critical to seedling performance. To
   determine the role of root-associated fungi (RAF) in post-fire seedling
   recruitment and future biome shifts, we outplanted four dominant boreal
   tree and shrub species inoculated with one of three treatments at
   treeline and in tundra: burned boreal forest, unburned boreal forest, or
   a control treatment of sterilized inoculum. We compared survivorship,
   growth, and physiological performance of the seedlings in relation to
   mycorrhizal inoculum treatment and among host species, characterized the
   RAF communities based on ITS-rDNA sequencing of individual root tips
   sampled from surviving seedlings, and tested for correlations between
   RAF composition and the inoculation treatments, host species, and
   duration of the experiment. We explored correlations between RAF
   composition and seedling metrics. Both live and sterile autoclaved
   inoculation treatments had similar effects on seedling survivorship and
   growth for all species. RAF composition did not vary by treatment,
   suggesting that most colonization was due to local fungi. However,
   seedling traits and growth were correlated with RAF species composition,
   colonization, and the relative abundance of specific RAF taxa.Piceasp.
   performance in particular showed strong co-variation with RAF metrics.
   Our results suggest that mycorrhizal co-migration is not a primary
   limiting factor to boreal seedling recruitment because the experimental
   provision of inoculum did not affect seedling recruitment; yet, RAF did
   influence seedling performance, particularly resident RAF at treeline
   and in tundra, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi are important to
   vegetation processes at the treeline-tundra ecotone.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major pedological changes produced by wildfires is the
   drastic modification of forest soil systems properties. To our
   knowledge, large research gaps are currently present concerning the
   effect of such fires on forest Haplic Luvisols soils in Central Europe.
   In this study, the effects of experimental fires on soil organic matter
   and chemical properties at different burning intensities in a Central
   European forest were examined. The study was conducted at Damak Forest,
   in Hungary, ecosystem dominated by deciduous broadleaf trees, including
   the rare Hungarian oak Quercus frainetto Ten. The experimental fires
   were carried out in nine different plots on Haplic Luvisol soils
   transferred from Damak Forest to the burning site. Three types of fuel
   load were collected from the forest: litter layer, understorey and
   overstorey. Groups of three plots were burned at low (litter layer),
   medium intensity (litter and understorey) and high intensity (litter,
   understorey and overstorey). Pre-fire and post-fire soil samples were
   taken from each plot, analysed in the laboratory and statistically
   compared. Key plant nutrients of organic matter, carbon, potassium,
   calcium, magnesium and phosphorus were analysed from each sample. No
   significant differences in soil organic matter and carbon between pre-
   and post-fire samples were observed, but high intensity fires did
   increase soil pH significantly. Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus
   availability increased significantly at all fire intensity levels. Soil
   potassium levels significantly decreased (ca. 50\%) for all intensity
   treatments, in contrast to most literature. Potassium is a key nutrient
   for ion transport in plants, and any loss of this nutrient from the soil
   could have significant effects on local agricultural production.
   Overall, our findings provide evidence that support the maintaining of
   the current Hungarian fire prevention policy.}},

Abstract = {{Fire regimes are changing throughout the world. Changed fire patterns
   across northern Australian savannas have been proposed as a factor
   contributing to recent declines of small- and medium-sized mammals.
   Despite this, few studies have examined the mechanisms that underpin how
   species use habitat in fire-affected landscapes. We determined the
   habitats and resources important to the declining golden-backed tree-rat
   (Mesembriomys macrurus) in landscapes partially burnt by recent intense
   fire. We aimed to (i) compare the relative use of rainforest and savanna
   habitats; (ii) examine the effect of fire history on use of savanna
   habitats; and (iii) identify key foraging and denning resources. Habitat
   selection was examined by comparing the availability of eight habitat
   types around real (used) and generated (available) location points.
   Individuals used a range of habitats, but consistently selected long
   unburnt rainforest in preference to recently burnt savanna (1-12 months
   post-fire); however, recently burnt savanna was used in preference to
   long unburnt savanna. Tree-rats foraged in Terminalia hadleyana,
   Planchonia rupestris, Celtis philippensis and Owenia vernicosa, tree
   species that are found in a variety of habitat types. Individuals used a
   range of den sites, including cliffs, trees, logs, scree and stags found
   throughout the study area. Although multiple factors may have led to the
   decline of Mes.macrurus across its range, these results are consistent
   with the idea that changes in the savanna structure as a consequence of
   contemporary fire patterns could also have a role. The continued
   persistence of Mes.macrurus in the northwest Kimberley may be supported
   by land management strategies that conserve fruiting and hollow-bearing
   trees, and maintain the availability of fire-sensitive vegetation types.}},

Abstract = {{The vast territory in the south-western periphery of the Altai-Sayan
   mountain country is identified as a special physical-geographical region
   - Rudny Altai. High rainfall and a considerable amount of heat provide
   the development of the peculiar forest formation in the region known as
   black taiga, where the Siberian fir is the main forest forming species.
   Pyrogenic factor along with timber harvesting is very important in the
   formation of the composition and structure of the forest area of Rydny
   Altai. Study objective was to determine the age stages of fir natural
   regeneration on the burnt areas. The main tasks were to analyze the
   dynamics of post-fire recovery of the fir stands and the study of
   natural regeneration processes on the burnt areas. When collecting
   primary data for the study of forest dynamics we adhered to the
   generally accepted methodological approach. Forest dynamics analysis was
   carried out within the same boundaries. Taxation parameters of
   allotments and their categorization for a few forest inventory periods
   were discharged for the selected land plots. A.V. Pobedinskiy discount
   areas method was used to study the natural regeneration. As a result of
   the study the natural regeneration processes of Siberian fir were
   revealed, fir undergrowth quantitative parameters at different stages
   were established and reforestation success was evaluated. Poor natural
   regeneration in the first two stages of the forest forming process was
   noted. Fir undergrowth was met extremely rare and only in close
   proximity to the forest edge or surviving separated fir groups. It was
   found that the recovery and formation of the vegetation for the first
   post-fire 150 years in grass ferny fir forest conditions pass through
   three consequent recovery and age-related stages. The first stage is the
   recent burnt areas, which are characterized by complete loss of all the
   components of biocenoses. Secondary insects start to attack the parent
   forest stand debris as well as windfall. The grass and shrub
   associations and deciduous saplings formation characterize the second
   stage. Birch, mountain ash, willow natural seeding is been accumulated.
   They start to grow at burnt areas along with burr-type specimens forming
   the separated forest stands. The third stage is described by the
   derivatives of birch or aspen forests with fir undergrowth in the second
   tree layer. It is a period of derivative birch or aspen forest
   domination of the first or even the second generation with fir
   undergrowth in the second tree layer. Middle-aged fir forests can be
   formed on the northern slopes, dishes and microdepressions by 150 years.
   The recovery process of burnt areas begins with broadleaved species
   groups' formation and is accompanied by their further spatial dispersal.
   Hardwood increase induces the accumulation of dark coniferous
   undergrowth. The long period of forest formation (more than 150 . . .
   200 years) as well as periodicity in fruitification and complexity in
   the accumulation of undergrowth cause uneven-aged pyrogenic fir forests.
   Natural regeneration in the first two stages is assessed as
   unsatisfactory.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal aspects of recruitment play a central role in plant
   population and community dynamics and have important basic and applied
   implications. Here we summarize and discuss the results from studies of
   spatiotemporal dynamics of recruitment stages (seeds-seedlings-saplings)
   in Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) throughout the species' native range.
   Seed release is induced either by fire (pyriscence) or by drying
   atmospheric conditions (xeriscence), each generating a distinct temporal
   pattern. In both cases most seeds travel relatively short distances (<30
   m). Pyriscence is not expected to promote long-distance seed dispersal,
   but xeriscence is associated with relatively strong winds that can
   transport seeds over 1 km and more, as predicted by a new mechanistic
   dispersal model. In the absence of fire, seed survival increases with
   distance from adults because of higher competition with adults and sibs
   and higher seed predation near the seed sources. New data provide
   further evidence for such distance-dependent seed predation and also
   show that predation rates vary among habitats and are lowest in times of
   high seed abundance. The resulting recruitment patterns in the absence
   of fire are characterized by rapid spread and complex spatiotemporal
   dynamics that are fairly unpredictable and give rise to variable age
   structure. In contrast, the spatial pattern of the first post-fire
   generation is highly predictable because it explicitly replicates the
   spatial pattern of the pre-fire population. Unlike fire-free
   regeneration in which multiple factors operating at various stages are
   likely to be important, post-fire regeneration is governed by a fairly
   specific set of factors (the chemical properties of ash) operating
   during a specific stage (saplings) and at a specific location (the
   canopy projection of large burned pines). Post-fire forests are
   therefore even-aged and have predictable spatiotemporal dynamics. Most
   studies of Aleppo pine recruitment have focused on the seedling and
   sapling stages and on post-fire regeneration; we call for greater
   attention to the seed stage and to more extensive sampling of all
   recruitment stages in both space and time.}},

Abstract = {{Jack pine is a fire adapted species considered to regenerate well after
   fires of all severities. The Richardson Fire was an extreme megafire
   event that burned 576,000 ha of jack pine dominated boreal forest in
   2011 in northern Alberta, Canada. Initial scouting immediately after the
   fire identified a great deal of variability in jack pine regeneration
   seemingly related to fire severity and pre-fire stand composition. We
   sampled tree regeneration in 56 pure jack pine stands across the range
   of fire severity and pre-fire stand ages 1 year post-fire. We found that
   jack pine regeneration density was greater in older stands (>60 years
   old) compared to younger stands (<30 years old) and in moderate severity
   burns compared to high severity burns. In young stands with high
   severity burns, jack pine regeneration averaged only 1164 seedlings per
   hectare which is well below current stand densities indicating a
   potentially understocked future forest. At the landscape level, we
   extrapolated fire severity to the entire fire area using pre and
   post-fire satellite imagery and found that the area of young jack pine
   stands which had a high severity burn, and therefore likely low seedling
   regeneration, was greater than 130,000 ha with most of this area
   occurring in patches greater than 500 ha in size. Overall, our results
   suggest that young jack pine may not be as resilient to high severity
   fires as previously thought and that a large area of burned boreal
   forest may be at risk of conversion from a closed canopy forest to a
   more open canopy woodland ecosystem given the predicted changes in fire
   regime. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The response to prescribed burning of plant communities ranging from dry
   to wet habitats was monitored using permanent plots sampled from 1989 to
   1993. Temporal controls for fire effects were provided by matched sets
   of plots protected from fire by newly constructed fire breaks. Changes
   in species composition were studied by ordination of strata of trees (>5
   cm DBH), small trees (2 - 5 cm DBH), large saplings (1 - 2 cm DBH), and
   small saplings and seedlings (50 - 140 cm tall). Results show that
   changes occurred largely in the small tree stratum, in which xeric
   species increased in importance. Although there were changes in sapling
   and seedling strata, no clear direction of change was recognized. Fire
   had little effect on the tree stratum.
   Of the seven community types under study, three types, sandhill, upland
   pine, and upperslope pine-oak, were most strongly affected, as indicated
   by post-fire change in positions of samples representing these
   communities in ordination space and reduction in understory species
   abundance. Samples representing the other four mesic and wet communities
   showed little or no change in their positions.
   These short-term results indicate that changes in vegetation resulting
   from fire were small and were mostly restricted to the dry types in
   which possible compositional change is expected to occur. This
   differential effect of fire suggests that the influence of fire is
   secondary to that of topographical and soil gradients in determining
   vegetation pattern under current fire regimes. Fire seems to reinforce
   an overall vegetation gradient controlled by soil in southeastern Texas.}},

   the effects of different disturbance types (low and high severity fires
   and non-salvage logging), and to evaluate how seed banks contribute to
   post-disturbance vegetation establishment. Sites were selected to
   represent disturbances at 1, 5, and 10 years prior to sampling, and data
   were analyzed using nonparametric univariate and multivariate
   statistical techniques. Seed density and species composition of seed
   banks did not differ significantly among the 1 year disturbed sites;
   however, the rooted frequencies of seed-origin plants in the

   fire is believed to be an important recovery mechanism on burned sites.
   Low frequencies of seed-derived plants, particularly conifer seedlings,
   on logged sites pose concerns for the initial recovery of vegetation
   following logging; nonetheless, the lack of significant differences in
   understory species composition between sites burned 5 years prior to
   sampling and sites logged 10 years prior to sampling, and their

Abstract = {{Fires, whether intentionally or accidentally set, commonly occur in
   western interior forests of the US. Following fire, managers need the
   ability to predict mortality of individual trees based on easily
   observed characteristics. Previously, a two-factor model using crown
   scorch and bole scorch proportions was developed with data from 3415
   trees for predicting the probability of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   Dougl. ex Laws.) mortality following prescribed fire. Here, we report
   validation of that model for broader application using data from 10 109
   ponderosa pines in 17 prescribed fires and 7 wildfires, observed for 3
   years post-fire, from east of the Cascade Range crest in Washington,
   Oregon and northern California. The overall rate of correct
   classification was 87.1\% and the rate of correctly predicting mortality
   was 80.1\%. Similar accuracy is reported when testing the model for
   small trees (<53.3-cm diameter at breast height), wildfire, prescribed
   fire, and when using a field guide that simplifies application of the
   model. For large trees (>= 53.3-cm diameter at breast height), the
   overall rate of correct prediction was 93.6\% and the rate of correctly
   predicting mortality was 65.2\%. These results suggest the Malheur model
   is useful for predicting ponderosa pine mortality following fires in

Abstract = {{The Mill Fire, which burned in north-western California during the
   summer of 2012, provided a unique research opportunity when firefighters
   implemented a backfiring operation to limit wildfire growth. This
   backfire was ignited and burned through research plots from a long-term
   study designed to determine the effects of tree density manipulation and
   shrub control on the growth and stand development of a ponderosa pine
   plantation. The objectives of this study were to examine the response of
   these 53-year-old trees to the backfire and to determine how the fire
   effects differed with plantation structure and composition. Measurements
   made 4 years post-fire showed that mortality rate was highly variable
   (from 0 to 100\%) and did not relate to tree density, height of live
   crown, total basal area or shrub cover. Bole char height explained 65\%
   of the variation in mortality rate. Fire appeared to spread primarily
   through the surface litter and killed a substantial proportion of the
   shrubs competing with the trees for water and nutrients. Importantly,
   post-fire tree growth was not significantly affected relative to
   pre-fire growth. A lack of negative effects of the fire on radial growth
   was possibly a result of release from inter-tree and shrub competition,
   which balanced any declines that might have been expected from bole
   injury or crown loss. Results from the present study demonstrate that
   ponderosa pine plantations could potentially be treated with managed
   fire (e.g. prescribed fire) without pretreatment (i.e. thinning,
   mastication), and still achieve good survival and improved resilience to
   wildfires burning under uncontrolled conditions.}},

Abstract = {{``Fire and biodiversity{''} is a much-discussed topic based on research
   in different countries under varying environmental conditions and fire
   regimes. Nevertheless, until now, no research has been carried out on
   faunal post-fire biodiversity in winter fire-prone ecosystems such as
   deciduous forests on the south-facing slopes of the Alps. The basic
   objectives of this study were to analyse the effects of single and
   recurring fires on spider communities and their subsequent diversity.
   Epigeic spiders were used as bioindicators to describe the ecological
   response of chestnut forest-floor habitats to winter fires in Southern
   Switzerland. Overall, 143 spider species were sampled from April to
   September using pitfall traps at both post-fire and intact chestnut
   coppice sites. Approximately 30\% of the species found were present
   exclusively in burnt sites (compared with only 7\% found exclusively in
   intact areas). These results suggest that post-fire succession was
   initiated by surviving individuals. No dominant pioneer species were
   observed in the burnt sites. Changes in communities were observable only
   within the first two years after a single fire, whereas changes
   persisted in areas with recurring fires. In the latter case, communities
   were characterised by the eudominance of a single species (Pardosa
   saltans) and by an increase in species richness. The presence of species
   strongly associated with particular fire regimes indicates a wide-mosaic
   structure of environmental and microclimatic conditions at the epigeic
   level, with a predominance of xeric conditions. Evidence was found that
   major silvicultural projects implemented before and during the early
   1950's, combined with an intense fire history, have played an important
   role in the development of the spider communities in the chestnut forest
   of the Southern Alps.}},

Title = {{Landscape-scale effects of fire on bird assemblages: does pyrodiversity
   beget biodiversity?}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{519-529}},

Abstract = {{Aim A common strategy for conserving biodiversity in fire-prone
   environments is to maintain a diversity of post-fire age classes at the
   landscape scale, under the assumption that pyrodiversity begets
   biodiversity. Another strategy is to maintain extensive areas of a
   particular seral state regarded as vital for the persistence of
   threatened species, under the assumption that this will also cater for
   the habitat needs of other species. We investigated the likely effects
   of these strategies on bird assemblages in tree mallee vegetation,
   characterized by multi-stemmed Eucalyptus species, where both strategies
   are currently employed.
   Location The semi-arid Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia.
   Methods We systematically surveyed birds in 26 landscapes (each 4-km
   diameter), selected to represent gradients in the diversity of fire age
   classes and the proportion of older vegetation (> 35 years since fire).
   Additional variables were measured to represent underlying vegetation-or
   fire-mediated properties of the landscape, as well as its biogeographic
   context. We used an informationtheoretic approach to investigate the
   relationships between these predictor variables and the species richness
   of birds (total species, threatened species and rare species).
   Results Species richness of birds was not strongly associated with
   fire-mediated heterogeneity. Species richness was associated with
   increasing amounts of older vegetation in landscapes, but not with the
   proportion of recently burned vegetation in landscapes.
   Main conclusions The preference of many mallee birds for older
   vegetation highlights the risk of a blanket application of the `
   pyrodiversity begets biodiversity' paradigm. If application of this
   paradigm involved converting large areas from long unburned to recently
   burned vegetation to increase firemediated heterogeneity in tree mallee
   landscapes, our findings suggest that this could threaten birds. This
   research highlights the value of adopting a landscapescale perspective
   when evaluating the utility of fire-management strategies intended to
   benefit biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Experimental evidence on biodiversity impacts of variable retention
   forestry, prescribed burning, and deadwood manipulation in Fennoscandia}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Intensive forest management has been applied in most Fennoscandian
   forests for a period of almost one felling rotation. This paradigm has
   produced even-aged and even-structured forests of different successional
   stages that cover about 90\% of forest land. At the same time, wildfires
   have been nearly eliminated in most of the Fennoscandian nature.
   Consequently, hundreds of species are red-listed because of forest
   management. To support these species, forest management requires
   improvements. Variable retention forestry and habitat restoration have
   been suggested to mitigate negative effects of forest management on
   biodiversity, and these have been practiced to some extent during the
   past few decades. Here, we review experimental results on the effects of
   variable retention and two restoration measures (prescribed burning and
   artificial addition of coarse woody debris) on different species groups
   in Fennoscandia. Our key findings are as follows: (i) Many species
   respond positively to felling within a few years, apparently due to
   released and often ephemeral resources, such as fresh residue and
   stumps. Species associated with shady conditions are negatively
   impacted, but any retention supports many of these, and their species
   composition remains almost unaffected with 50-70\% retention of the
   initial tree volume. (ii) These effects remain detectable for at least
   10- 30 years or, according to some studies, nearly 100 years, e.g., in
   polypore fungi. (iii) Initial effects of prescribed burning on most
   species groups (apart from pyrophiles) are negative, but within 10-15
   years post-fire sites begin to support many rare and threatened
   deadwood-dependent species. Epiphytic lichens, however, remain
   negatively affected. (iv) Artificial addition of deadwood (mostly high
   stumps) supports a wide spectrum of deadwood-dependent species, but the
   species composition differs from that of naturally died trees. (v)
   Moisture and micro-habitat variation are crucial for forest species at
   harvested sites, at least in forests dominated by Norway spruce. We
   conclude that felling method as such is of little importance for
   threatened forest species, although retention mitigates many negative
   effects. These species require microclimatic continuity, and maintenance
   and active increase of legacies, such as deadwood of different qualities
   (species, downed/standing, snag/log/stump, decay stage), very old trees,
   and tree species mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents the effects of fire on grass-layer invertebrates in
   tropical savannas of the Kimberley region of north-western Australia, in
   the context of resource availability for consumers. Inappropriate fire
   regimes have been identified as a factor threatening a number of
   vertebrate groups, including small mammals, across northern Australia,
   and a possible mechanism might be through the effects of individual
   fires or fire regimes on food availability. We test for a fire effect on
   grass-layer invertebrate resources, which may affect insectivorous
   savanna vertebrates. Wet season sweep-net invertebrate samples were
   taken in two tropical savanna habitats, with contrasting laterite and
   sandstone substrates, in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Sites were stratified by
   post-fire interval to analyse invertebrate successional change after
   fire. In addition, experimental burns were implemented in 2010 to
   investigate immediate post-fire invertebrate responses. Total
   invertebrate numbers declined by 8090\% immediately (1 week) following
   fire, reflecting the loss of grass-layer habitat. Of the commonly
   sampled invertebrate groups, Araneae, Coleoptera, Hempitera,
   Lepidoptera, Formicidae and Diptera were all reduced in numbers
   immediately post-fire, whereas Orthoptera showed no immediate post-fire
   decline. Invertebrate numbers were rapidly restored to pre-fire levels
   by the first wet season after fire, and no detectible change was
   observed in numbers or composition from 1 to 34 years post-fire (the
   longest post-fire interval available). This suggests that the effects of
   individual fires on grass-layer invertebrates are very short-lived. Such
   short-lived post-fire responses among grass-layer invertebrates, plus
   evidence that most ground-layer invertebrate groups are fire-resilient,
   suggest that food resource limitation is not a tenable explanation for
   fire-related declines among insectivorous savanna vertebrates. However,
   wet season burning could result in significant invertebrate resource
   depletion in highly flammable habitats (Triodia and Sorghum spp.
   savannas) during important vertebrate breeding/recruitment periods, if
   burning is extensive and if grass-layer invertebrates do not recover
   within a few weeks of fire.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-severity fires are increasingly recognized as common in
   Pseudotsuga forests of the Pacific Northwest and may be an important
   mechanism for developing or maintaining their structural diversity and
   complexity. Questions remain, about how tree mortality varies and forest
   structure is altered across the disturbance gradient imposed by these
   fires. Therefore, we sampled live and dead trees at 45-1.0 ha plots,
   each with four 0.10 ha nested subplots, stratified across an unburned,
   low, moderate and high-severity fire gradient. Burned plots were
   primarily sampled 10 and 22 years post-fire, except three plots sampled
   four years post-fire. We estimated probability of mortality for
   fire-tolerant (Douglas-fir, incense-cedar, sugar pine) and
   fire-intolerant (western hemlock, western redcedar, true fir) trees from
   5079 samples. The probability of mortality varied across all species and
   fire-severity classes, but the greatest difference was observed between
   fire-tolerant and fire-intolerant functional groups. Probability of
   mortality decreased with increasing DBH for all species except western
   hemlock that did not increase its fire resistance with increasing size.
   Some large, fire-tolerant trees survived high severity fire but only in
   31\% of our plots. Snag fall and fragmentation was estimated for trees
   killed by the fire from 2746 sampled snags and logs 10 and 22 years
   post-fire. The proportion of snags fallen decreased with increasing DBH
   for all species, and was positively correlated with fire severity,
   except for Douglas-fir that had a higher proportion felled following
   low-severity fire. Snag fragmentation rates were positively correlated
   with DBH and fire severity for all species. Individual tree and snag
   estimates were scaled to plot-level structural attributes and contrasted
   by their coefficient of variation within- and among-plots from unburned
   to moderate-severity, as well as across all sampled conditions.
   Structural attributes varied more within- than among-plots, likely a
   result of patchy mortality that increased with fire severity. Although
   vertical and horizontal structural diversity increased at sub-hectare
   scales, the highest variability occurred for all structural attributes
   when compared across all sampled conditions. We conclude that the range

Abstract = {{Forest fire intensity can impact the survival and recovery of soil fauna
   at local scales. We compared three contiguous sites differing in fire
   history to explore post-fire succession of collembolan (Hexapoda:
   Apterygota) communities in a maple-oak forest in southern Quebec,
   Canada. We found a total of 22 collembolan species from 8 families and
   17 genera at sites burned 0, similar to 50, and similar to 100 years in
   the past; samples from the most recent fire were collected in both
   lightly and intensely burned patches. Shifts in community composition
   were significantly related to time since a fire disturbance, burn
   intensity, and consumption of litter and organic soil horizons during
   recent fire events. Using a trait-based approach we demonstrate that
   species that remain following high-intensity fire are smaller-bodied
   than species in unburned areas. Additional character states (eyeless,
   unpigmented) suggest these species are endogeaic versus epigeaic, and
   that litter loss associated with high-intensity fire is the main driver
   of collembolan community compositional changes. We suggest that
   understanding Collembola community dynamics in response to a fire
   disturbance will require a better understanding of the spatial
   configuration of remnant habitat patches within heterogeneous burn
   sites, and patterns of collembolan dispersal and recolonization in three
   dimensional space. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

   black-backed and three-toed woodpecker occupancy of stands in a 2-year
   post-fire forest, mature and old-growth spruce and pine forests, and six
   post-fire coniferous forests of different ages. Three-toeds were

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal effectiveness, which measures the number of adult plant
   individuals produced by seed dispersal, is the product of the number of
   seeds dispersed and the probability a seed produces an adult. Directed
   dispersal to certain habitat types may enhance some stages of
   recruitment but disfavor others, generating demographic conflicts in
   plant ontogeny. We asked whether temporal changes in habitat features
   may affect the distribution of seedlings recruited from dispersed
   acorns, and whether this could induce shifts in the life-stage conflicts
   experienced by successive cohorts of naturally recruited plants. As
   early successional habitats are characterized by rapid change, we used a
   burnt pine stand in southern Spain to monitor the recruitment and
   performance of a major tree species (Quercus ilex) across 7 yr in four
   types of post-fire habitats. These differed in structure and included
   patches of unburnt forest and three management alternatives of burnt
   trees: logging, partial cutting, and nonintervention. Young oaks that
   resprouted after the fire were mainly located near acorn sources, while
   new seedlings initially emerged mostly in habitats with standing snags
   due to habitat selection by European jays, Garrulus glandarius, for
   dispersal. The dead pines gradually collapsed and attracted less
   dispersal, so subsequent seedling cohorts mainly recruited within
   patches of unburnt pines. These live pines enhanced the survival of the
   oaks located beneath their canopy but greatly reduced their growth as
   compared to the other post-fire habitats, thus representing a
   demographic conflict that was absent elsewhere. As a consequence of the
   directional shift in the habitat where seedlings recruited, successive
   seedling cohorts experienced a gradual improvement in their likelihood
   of survival but a reduction in growth. The progressive intensification
   of this life-stage conflict hinged on the reduction of vertical
   structures in the habitat with standing burnt pines. Recruitment success
   thus involved temporal variation in the habitat where recruitment
   occurred, likely resulting from changes in the direction of seed
   dispersal, and spatial variation in habitat suitability for seedling
   establishment and growth. Temporal changes in habitat structure can
   indirectly change the environment in which recruitment occurs, and
   consequently seed dispersal effectiveness, by shifting the direction of
   seed dispersal.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{441}},
Pages = {{202-214}},

Abstract = {{Researchers and managers increasingly recognize enterprise risk
   management as critical to addressing contemporary fire management
   challenges. Quantitative wildfire risk assessments contribute by parsing
   and mapping potentially contradictory positive and negative fire
   effects. However, these assessments disregard risks to fire responders
   because they only address social and ecological resources and assets. In
   this study, we begin to overcome this deficiency by using a novel
   modeling approach that integrates remote sensing, field inventories,
   imputation-based vegetation modeling, and empirical models to quantify
   post-fire snag hazard in space and time. Snag hazard increased
   significantly immediately post-fire, with severe or extreme hazard
   conditions accounting for 47\%, 83\%, and 91\% of areas burned at low,
   moderate and high-severity fire, respectively. Patchsize of severe or
   extreme hazard positively correlated with fire size, exceeding > 20,000
   ha (60\% of our largest fire) 10-years post-fire when reburn becomes
   more likely. After 10 years, snag hazard declined rapidly as snags fell
   or fragmented, but severe or extreme hazard persisted for 20, 30 and 35
   years in portions of the low, moderate and high-severity fire areas.
   Because forests are denser and wildfires burn with greater severity than
   historically, these hazardous conditions may represent novel management
   challenges where risk of injury or death to responders outweighs the
   benefits of directly engaging the fire. Mapping snag hazard with our
   methodology could improve situational awareness for both decision makers
   and fire responders as they mitigate risk during fire management.
   However, as more landscapes burn we anticipate increased responder
   exposure to extremely hazardous conditions, which may further entrench
   the wildfire paradox as fire managers weigh current response decisions
   with future challenges. Aligning land management objectives with
   wildfire management needs, in part by mapping responder exposure to
   snags and other hazards, could help overcome the wildfire paradox and
   produce desirable long-term outcomes. This research also demonstrates
   the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to account for risk to
   all aspects of fire prone social-ecological systems as we learn to live
   with fire in rapidly changing environments.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the factors affecting the current variability in

   nigra and Quercus faginea in Central Catalonia (NE Spain), 37 years
   after a wildfire. The objective is to determine whether different
   post-disturbance responses may be obtained from the same pre-fire
   community and which factors can determine these different potential
   responses. The two factors analyzed were the distance to the unburned
   forest and site conditions (represented in this case by different
   aspects). The response of pines and oaks was different to the pattern
   expected for the Mediterranean Basin. Oaks resprouted immediately from
   stools already present before the fire and dominated during the first
   years, independent of both disturbance and site conditions. Pines
   established later, and their response depended on both factors: pine
   density decreased sharply from the forest edge to the burned area, and
   the number of pines was also higher in the more mesic than in the more
   xeric conditions. The age structure analysis for pines and oaks in the
   different aspects also revealed site-dependent rates of succession
   manifested by initial differences in post-fire establishment. In mesic
   plots, the establishment of pines occurred quite early, while in xeric
   plots, pine recruitment was delayed several years. These different
   patterns of post-fire recovery have led to pine dominance in more mesic
   sites and codominance of pines and oaks in more xeric ones, suggesting
   that different mid-term post-fire patterns can be identified for the
   same pre-fire forest type, depending on variations in environmental
   conditions. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Abstract = {{Post-fire changes in desert vegetation patterns are known, but the
   mechanisms are poorly understood. Theory suggests that pulse dynamics of
   resource availability confer advantages to invasive annual species, and
   that pulse timing can influence survival and competition among species.
   Precipitation patterns in the American Southwest are predicted to shift
   toward a drier climate, potentially altering post-fire resource
   availability and consequent vegetation dynamics. We quantified post-fire
   inorganic N dynamics and determined how annual plants respond to soil
   inorganic nitrogen variability following experimental fires in a Mojave
   Desert shrub community. Soil inorganic N, soil net N mineralization, and
   production of annual plants were measured beneath shrubs and in
   interspaces during 6 months following fire. Soil inorganic N pools in
   burned plots were up to 1 g m(-2) greater than unburned plots for
   several weeks and increased under shrubs (0.5-1.0 g m(-2)) more than
   interspaces (0.1-0.2 g m(-2)). Soil NO3 (-)-N (nitrate-N) increased more
   and persisted longer than soil NH4 (+)-N (ammonium-N). Laboratory
   incubations simulating low soil moisture conditions, and consistent with
   field moisture during the study, suggest that soil net ammonification
   and net nitrification were low and mostly unaffected by shrub canopy or
   burning. After late season rains, and where soil inorganic N pools were
   elevated after fire, productivity of the predominant invasive Schismus
   spp. increased and native annuals declined. Results suggest that
   increased N availability following wildfire can favor invasive annuals
   over natives. Whether the short-term success of invasive species
   following fire will direct long-term species composition changes remains
   to be seen, yet predicted changes in precipitation variability will
   likely interact with N cycling to affect invasive annual plant dominance
   following wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{The post-fire growth responses and changes in wood C and N isotope

   Mediterranean Aleppo pine forests.
   Mediterranean forests are subjected to recurrent wildfires and summer
   droughts. Under warmer and drier conditions, it is required to determine
   how Mediterranean pines recover after wildfires, and how this translates
   into changes in tree radial growth and function (e.g. intrinsic
   water-use efficiency-iWUE). We analysed four Aleppo pine areas located
   in SE Spain affected by 1994 wildfires and subjected to different water
   availability, ranging from mesic to semi-arid conditions. We combined
   dendrochronological analyses with delta C-13 and delta N-15 wood
   isotopes to quantify the changes in radial growth (expressed as Basal
   Area Increment-BAI) and functional responses (iWUE and N cycling) to
   three fire severities (unburned sites, low and medium severities). We
   expected that the post-fire release in nutrients and a reduction in
   competition for water would enhance radial growth. We found that fire
   did not significantly alter growth patterns at the driest sites, but
   increased BAI at the wettest sites. delta C-13 was significantly (P a
   parts per thousand currency sign 0.01) more negative only in burned
   stands located at the wettest site indicating a decreased iWUE and thus
   improved water availability. However, the delta N-15 was higher in
   severely burned than in unburned plots from all sites but the wettest
   site, indicating a potential fertilization effect of fire in sites
   subjected to mild drought severity. Site water availability determined
   how fire affected subsequent modifications in growth and tree
   functioning of Aleppo pine forests, that is, changes in iWUE and N
   cycling. Therefore, site dryness should be explicitly considered to
   forecast the growth and functioning responses of Mediterranean pine
   forests to the predicted increasing recurrence of fire events due to

Abstract = {{Fire is considered the main cause for the patchy distribution of
   high-montane tropical forests growing below the upper limit of tree
   growth, but there are little quantitative data on the impacts of burning
   on the respective tree populations. This study compares adult tree
   survival as well as sapling (0.05-1.3 m) and seedling (< 0.05 m)
   recruitment of Polylepis incana, and the coexisting Gynoxis acostae in
   burned and unburned forest stands in the Paramo de Guamani, central
   Ecuador. In P. incana, adult survival after burning was low, whereas all
   G. acostae individuals survived through resprouting. Two years after
   fire, the density of P incana seedlings and saplings was higher than
   that of G. acostae, but still not sufficient for forest recovery. A
   sowing experiment revealed a significantly lower seedling emergence of
   both species in the burned than in the unburned plots. Seedling
   emergence was comparable to laboratory studies performed under optimal
   conditions, suggesting there was no evidence for climate constraining
   emergence at the given altitude. Interactions between seedling survival
   and burning for P incana indicate higher seedling survival after
   burning, which could not be shown for G. acostae. Our data imply that
   single fire events strongly decrease adult and seedling population sizes
   in P incana and thus may be the main reason for the discontinuous forest
   distribution below the upper distribution limit of the species. In
   contrast, the high resprouting potential of G. acostae explains its
   relatively high percentage in the remaining Ecuadorian P incana stands.}},

Title = {{Habitat. use at fire edges: Does animal activity follow temporal
   patterns of habitat change?}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{451}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Edges are ecologically important environmental features that have been
   well researched in agricultural and urban landscapes. However, little
   work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and
   temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence animal activity
   patterns, particularly for animals reliant on vegetation for cover,
   foraging or nesting. We quantified the response of ground-dwelling
   mammals to fire edges and sought to determine whether animal activity
   mirrored temporal changes in regenerating understorey vegetation. We
   used a space-for-time substitution sampling design and selected a series
   of 26 treatment sites burnt by prescribed fire, where time since fire
   ranged from 0 to 7 years. Ten long-unbumt sites acted as controls. At
   each treatment site we identified a burnt/unburnt edge and used camera
   traps and Elliott traps to survey ground-dwelling mammals on either
   side. Habitat structure was measured at all 36 sites. We used general
   and generalised linear mixed models to determine the response of both
   habitat and animals to time since fire on both burnt and unburnt sides
   of edges. In addition, we used a resource selection index to assess the
   congruence between changes in understorey complexity and animal activity
   identified in the first set of analyses. On the unburnt side of the edge
   understorey complexity remained constant over time. On the burnt side
   understorey complexity followed a hump-shaped trend, peaking at 3 years
   post-fire where it exceeded the level of complexity on the unbumt edge.
   Larger animals with general resource requirements were more active at
   burnt compared to unburnt edges immediately after fire, but similarly
   active on both sides of fire edges from three years post-fire. Despite
   some activity on the burnt side of edges immediately after fire, small
   mammals were generally less active on burnt edges compared to unburnt
   edges for up to three years. Native species' activity did not follow
   patterns of temporal change in structurally complex understorey
   vegetation. For all species, selection was strongest at recently burnt
   edges with little vegetation and substantially lower at 3-7 year old
   regenerating edges where understorey complexity was higher. In general,
   patterns of selection on the unburnt side of edges were similar over
   time. Our findings suggest that vegetation change on the burnt side of
   fire edges may not be a good predictor of native mammal use. Foxes and
   cats, exotic predators in our system, were also using the burnt edge
   more than expected immediately after fire. Immediate post-fire predation
   may be higher at fire edges than elsewhere, and recently burnt edge
   zones could be suitable locations for integrated predator and fire
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Stirlingia latifolia R. Br. is a proteaceous undershrub that is
   widespread in open woodlands and heathlands of the south-west botanical
   province of Western Australia where it is subject to frequent fires,
   both natural and the result of fuel-reduction burns. Shoots are
   completely destroyed by fire but regenerate rapidly by resprouting
   numerous new shoots from the root crown. Flowering is strongly triggered
   by fire with only sparse flowering in fire-free periods. A study was
   undertaken to compare regrowth and flowering in populations of S.
   latifolia burnt in summer or autumn with populations burnt in spring as
   well as in unburnt population. Post-fire flowering was recorded in 92\%
   of plants burnt in summer/autumn compared with 73\% of plants burnt in
   spring and less than 3\% in populations that had not been burnt for more
   than 2 years. Plants burnt in summer/autumn resprouted an average of 8.5
   shoots from their root crown, of which 93\% developed an inflorescence.
   In contrast, spring-burnt plants averaged only 5.9 shoots per plant with
   only 64\% of these bearing an inflorescence. Ability to produce flowers
   was found to be related to plant age, with young individuals producing
   fewer or no inflorescences following spring burns in comparison with the
   more prolific flowering of similarly aged individuals following
   summer/autumn burns. Summer/autumn-burnt plants also produced
   significantly longer inflorescence-bearing shoots bearing a greater
   numbers of flower heads than those burnt in spring. Possible
   explanations for these results are given in the present report.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-78}},
Abstract = {{The Highway Fire burned 1680 ha of mixed ponderosa pine-oak-chaparral in
   the newly created Giant Sequoia National Monument and the adjacent
   Sequoia National Forest of Fresno County, California in August 2001. The
   USDA Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) program
   recommended that portions of the burned forest be seeded with a
   non-persistent variety of wheat at a density of 157 kg ha(-1) (140
   lb/ac). The present study compared the vascular plant diversity and
   cover in seeded and unseeded parts of this burn to evaluate the
   ecological impact of seeding an alien grass. In the first post-fire
   growing season, the natural regeneration of unseeded control sites
   averaged similar to55\% ground surface covered. Wheat seeding enhanced
   the ground cover, averaging 95\% ground surface cover. Wheat was the
   dominant species on the seeded sites, comprising 67\% of the total
   cover. Dominance-diversity curves were markedly affected by the seeding
   and indicated a disruption in the natural ecological structure of these
   communities. On seeded sites, wheat dominated and all other species were
   poorly represented whereas, on unseeded control sites, there was a more
   equitable distribution of species. Correlated with the wheat cover was a
   significant decrease in species richness at all scales examined. Total
   species richness was reduced from 152 species across all unseeded sites
   to 104 species on all seeded sites. Average species richness, at scales
   from 1 to 1000 m(2), was 30-40\% lower on seeded sites. Species most
   strongly inhibited were post-fire endemics whose lifecycle is restricted
   to immediate post-fire environments. Seeded sites had fewer alien
   species than unseeded sites; however, this may not have any lasting
   effect since other studies show the primary alien threat is not in the
   first post-fire year. Seeding was also associated with an order of
   magnitude drop in Pinus ponderosa seedling recruitment and, coupled with
   the massive thatch still remaining on the site, it is likely that
   recruitment will be inhibited in subsequent years.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{35-44}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Wildland fire activity has increased in many parts of the world in
   recent decades. Ecological disturbance by fire can accelerate ecosystem
   degradation processes such as erosion due to combustion of vegetation
   that otherwise provides protective cover to the soil surface. This study
   employed a novel ecological indicator based on remote sensing of
   vegetation greenness dynamics (phenology) to estimate variability in the
   window of time between fire and the reemergence of green vegetation. The
   indicator was applied as a proxy for short-term, post-fire disturbance
   windows in rangelands: where a disturbance window is defined as the time
   required for an ecological or geomorphic process that is altered to
   return to pre-disturbance levels. We examined variability in the
   indicator determined for time series of MODIS and AVHRR NDVI remote
   sensing data for a database of similar to 100 historical wildland fires,
   with associated post-fire reseeding treatments, that burned 1990-2003 in
   cold desert shrub steppe of the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau of the
   western USA. The indicator-based estimates of disturbance window length
   were examined relative to the day of the year that fires burned and
   seeding treatments to consider effects of contemporary variability in
   fire regime and management activities in this environment. A key finding
   was that contemporary changes of increased length of the annual fire
   season could have indirect effects on ecosystem degradation, as early
   season fires appeared to result in longer time that soils remained
   relatively bare of the protective cover of vegetation after fires. Also
   important was that reemergence of vegetation did not occur more quickly
   after fire in sites treated with post-fire seeding, which is a strategy
   commonly employed to accelerate post-fire vegetation recovery and
   stabilize soil. Future work with the indicator could examine other
   ecological factors that are dynamic in space and time following
   disturbance - such as nutrient cycling, carbon storage, microbial
   community composition, or soil hydrology - as a function of disturbance
   windows, possibly using simulation modeling and historical wildfire

Abstract = {{Since the advent of widespread suppression in the mid-20th century, fire
   has been relatively rare in deciduous forests of the eastern United
   States. However, widespread prescribed burning has recently been
   proposed as a management tool to favor oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration.
   To examine the potential effects of fire introduction on the understory
   community, we experimentally burned small plots and simulated aspects of
   fire at a forested site in southeastern Ohio. Treatments included two
   burn intensities, litter removal, increased soil pH, and a control.
   Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design in two landscape
   positions (dry upland and moist lowland) and two canopy conditions (gap,
   no gap). Post-fire vegetation was identified to species, and stems were
   counted 1, 3, and 14 months after burning. Community composition was
   more strongly affected by fire in upland plots than in lowlands, but was
   not affected by canopy openness. Both cool and hot bums reduced
   post-fire seedling emergence of Acer rubrum, a common overstory tree.
   Hot burns facilitated germination of Vitis spp., Rhus glabra, and
   Phytolacca americana, species common in disturbed habitats, and
   increased graminoid abundance. Cool burns and litter removal facilitated
   germination of Erechtites hieracifolia and Liriodendron tulipifera
   suggesting that litter removal is the mechanism by which fire favors
   colonization. These results suggest that fire applied frequently in the
   Central Hardwoods Region would cause compositional shifts to graminoids
   and disturbance-adapted forbs by increasing germination from the seed
   bank. Fire did not favor species with dormant underground buds, as
   studies in other ecosystems would suggest. Vegetational responses were
   noticeably weaker in the second year after burning, indicating that a
   single fire has only a short-term effect. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fires can mediate switches between alternative vegetation types which

   Mediterranean Basin communities and its relation to tree cover decline.
   The effect of fire on Ampelodesmos population structure was analysed by
   surveying stands burned at different fire frequencies. The effect of
   vegetation dominated by Ampelodesmos on fire behaviour compared to other
   species coexisting in the community was predicted by the Rothermel fire
   propagation model BEHAVE. There was a negative correlation between pine
   cover and percentage of Ampelodesmos plants. Ampelodesmos mortality
   after fire is very low. Recently burned stands had a higher proportion
   of reproductive plants and higher seedling density than unburned stands.
   The high temperatures reached during fire may kill seeds, the higher
   seedling recruitment results from fast resprouting and higher seed
   production of burned plants compared to unburned plants 1 year after
   fire. Simulations with the BEHAVE fire model predict that Ampelodesmos
   increases fire intensity and spread because of its high accumulation of
   fuel load and standing dead material. The results suggest that there is
   a positive relationship between Ampelodesmos abundance and fire regime

Title = {{Fire timing in relation to masting: an important determinant of

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Plant species with fire-triggered germination are
   common in many fire-prone ecosystems. For such plants, fire timing in
   relation to the timing of reproduction may strongly influence post-fire
   population regeneration if: (a) flowering occurs infrequently (e.g.
   plants are mast seeders); and (b) seed survival rates are low and input
   from the current year's flowering therefore contributes a large
   proportion of the viable dormant seedbank. The role of fire timing in
   relation to masting as a driver of post-fire recruitment has rarely been
   examined directly, so this study tested the hypothesis that fires
   shortly after masting trigger increased recruitment of the
   obligate-seeding arid zone spinifex, Triodia pungens R.Br., an
   iteroparous masting grass with smoke-cued germination.
   Methods Phenological monitoring of T. pungens was conducted over 5
   years, while a longitudinal seedbank study assessed the influence of
   seeding events on soil-stored seedbank dynamics. Concurrently, a fire
   experiment with randomized blocking was undertaken to test whether T.
   pungens hummocks burnt shortly after masting have greater post-fire
   recruitment than hummocks burnt when there has not been recent input of
   seeds.
   Key Results Triodia pungens flowered in all years, though most
   flowerings were characterized by high rates of flower abortion. A mast
   flowering with high seed set in 2012 triggered approx. 200-fold
   increases in seedbank densities, and seedbank densities remained
   elevated for 24 months after this event. The fire experiment showed
   significantly higher recruitment around hummocks burnt 6 months after
   the 2012 mast event than a round hummocks that were burnt but prevented
   from masting by having inflorescences clipped.
   Conclusions Fires shortly after masting trigger mass recruitment in T.
   pungens because such fires synchronize an appropriate germination cue
   (smoke) with periods when seedbank densities are elevated. Interactions
   between natural fire regimes, seedbank dynamics and fire management
   prescriptions must be considered carefully when managing fire-sensitive
   masting plants such as T. pungens.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fire remains among the most controversial topics in nature

   species (representing 18.8 \% of total bee and wasp species known from
   the Czech Republic) that utilized 1-7-year-old burned forest stands.
   Species richness in the burned forest stands was significantly higher
   than that recorded in nearby forest that had been unaffected by any
   recent fire. The unburned forest hosted only 88 species. We found 42
   red-listed species, of which 40 were present in the burned forest, while
   only 12 were present in the control forest. Numerous early- and
   late-responding species were detected, but maximum species diversity was
   reached 3 years after the fire. Only 7 of the total of 261 species were
   limited to the forest that was unaffected by any recent fire. A
   management regime that supported the presence of bare sand and heather
   patches, and removal of all but solitary pine trees, was found to be
   insufficient to support the full spectrum of forest fire-dependent
   species. This was mainly due to the absence of charred or decaying dead
   wood, which is otherwise utilized by numerous red-listed cavity adopters
   that are absent in the surrounding cultural landscape. Retaining part of

Abstract = {{An overstory thinning and slash mulch treatment designed to improve
   ecohydrologic condition of degraded transitional (pinon-juniper)
   woodland sites was evaluated at four sites over a cumulative 16-year
   period beginning in 1994. Study sites were located within Bandelier
   National Monument and Santa Fe National Forest on the east-facing
   Pajarito Plateau of the Jemez Mountains in North-Central New Mexico.
   Across all sites, total understory cover increased several-fold at 3 to
   5years post-treatment relative to both pre-treatment condition and
   control, whereas measures of runoff and sediment production were reduced
   by an order of magnitude. During the course of post-treatment
   monitoring, several coincident disturbances (multi-year drought
   beginning in fall 1999, wildfire in spring 2000 and pinon ips beetle
   outbreak in 2002) caused widespread vegetation mortality and allowed
   differential recovery patterns to be documented across treatment and
   control areas. Response to these unplanned disturbances suggested prior
   restoration to improve ecohydrologic function of denuded intercanopy
   locations also primed understory resilience as measured by the relative
   capacity of restored areas to regain levels of effective cover.
   Treatment areas affected by drought-beetle tree mortality exceeded
   pre-drought levels of understory cover within two growing seasons while

Abstract = {{Increasing fire frequencies and uncharacteristic severe fires have
   created a need for improved restoration methods across rangelands in
   western North America. Traditional restoration seed mixtures of native
   perennial mid- to late-seral plant species may not be suitable for
   intensely burned sites that have been returned to an early-seral
   condition. Under such conditions, native annual plant species are likely
   to be more successful at becoming established and competing with exotic
   annual plant species, such as Bromus tectorum L., for resources. We used
   a field study in Colorado and Idaho, USA, to test the hypothesis that
   native annual plant species are better suited to post-fire restoration
   efforts compared with perennial plant species that are commonly used in
   traditional seed mixtures. Replicated test plots at three post-fire
   sites were assigned one of four treatments: (1) native annual seed
   mixture, (2) standard perennial seed mixture, (3) combination of annual
   and perennial and (4) an unseeded control. Seeding native annuals with
   perennials resulted in a slight reduction in exotic plant cover,
   suggesting that it is potentially beneficial to include native annual
   plant species in restoration seed mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of fire's influence on plant community succession has
   resulted in the near disappearance of oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands and
   savannas from the Appalachian region. Negative trends in associated
   plant and wildlife species could be reversed if these communities are
   restored, but management has been limited by inadequate canopy
   disturbance, resprouting of woody plants, and a lack of empirical
   research. To address these issues, we evaluated herbaceous and woody
   vegetation response (2008-2012) on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee
   to 5 replicated treatments involving canopy reduction (14 m(2) ha(-1)
   {[}woodland] or 7 m(2) ha(-1) {[}savanna] residual basal area) and
   fire-season (mid-March {[}spring] or early October {[}fall])
   combinations and unmanaged controls. All categories of woody vegetation
   except large saplings (>1.4 in tall and >7.6 but <12.7 cm diameter at
   breast height {[}DBH]), increased in density as canopy disturbance
   increased. Fire temporarily reduced small-sapling (>1.4 m tall and <7.6
   cm DBH) density, but resprouting resulted in densities equal to or
   exceeding pre-fire levels. Herbaceous richness increased from 22 to 167
   species following canopy disturbance and fire (2008-2012). Native cool
   season grasses dominated herbaceous response in treated sites.
   Herbaceous groundcover, richness, and diversity increased as canopy
   disturbance increased, and the rate of increase accelerated once basal
   area was reduced below 15 m(2) ha(-1) or 30\% canopy closure. Following
   fire, canopy disturbance remained influential as indicated by greater
   herbaceous response in savannas than woodlands. Graminoid and forb
   groundcover, herbaceous richness, and herbaceous diversity were 24X,
   11X, 9X, and 8X greater, respectively, in treatments than controls by
   2012. Invasive species were rare and increased minimally with increasing
   disturbance. Our results demonstrate the utility of canopy disturbance
   in conjunction with fire for restoring oak woodlands and savannas from
   closed-canopy forest conditions. Basal area reduction to 15 and 7 m(2)
   ha(-1) respectively approximated woodland and savanna canopy conditions,
   and increased herbaceous-layer development. The less intense October
   fire had similar effects on vegetation as the more intense March fire,
   but greater differences could become apparent following repeated
   burning. Long-term research documenting the response of vegetation to
   repeated fire is needed to promote successful oak woodland and savanna
   restoration throughout the Appalachian region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire - the intentional use of fire to help achieve a land
   management goal - is becoming increasingly common as a land management
   practice. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties can be
   affected by prescribed fires, but depend on the fire, soil type,
   residence time and frequency, and may not be changed substantially in
   low-severity burns. Here, we examined soil bacterial community
   composition immediately post-fire (15 days) in a sandy jack pine barrens
   soil in Wisconsin, USA. Soil bacterial communities clustered
   significantly by sample site (p < 0.001) and by soil horizon (p =
   0.048), but not by whether or not soil samples were visibly burned.
   There were also no significant differences in total relative abundance
   at the phylum level in visibly burned vs. not visibly burned soils, and
   only two significant differences in abundance or variability of
   individual taxa. Soil properties remained unchanged post-fire and the
   fire was visibly patchy, suggesting that the low severity prescribed
   fire most likely had a minimal soil heating effect. Therefore, we
   suggest the minimal bacterial community composition shifts seen in this
   study were likely mediated more by plants than by direct heat-killing or

   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. We examined how uncommon
   native Arizona gray squirrels and introduced Abert's squirrels used
   areas previously burned by widespread fires more than a decade prior to
   our study. To determine how past fire may affect squirrel habitat, we
   examined squirrel use and occupancy within fire altered habitats and
   used distance sampling to determine squirrel distribution, feeding, and
   nest use within a mosaic of burn severities. Occupancy and habitat use
   indicated that introduced Abert's squirrels readily used post-fire
   conditions more than native Arizona gray squirrels, likely due to the
   opening of a dense understory. Arizona gray squirrels remained in
   unburned riparian areas; therefore, fire affected riparian areas can be
   directly targeted for management to increase abundance of the native

Abstract = {{In the Great Basin, changes in climate and associated fire regimes may
   alter the density and distribution of shrubs, changing the structure and

   and phytochemical characteristics of three-tip sagebrush (Artemisia
   tripartita) relative to Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata
   wyomingensis) influence the winter foraging ecology of Greater
   Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) at a site with a known history
   of fire in south-central Idaho. Three-tip sagebrush had lower protein
   content and lower chemical defenses compared to Wyoming big sagebrush.
   We found that time since last fire over a 30-year history was more
   strongly correlated with changes in phytochemicals in three-tip
   sagebrush compared to Wyoming big sagebrush. Despite phytochemical
   differences, both Wyoming big sagebrush and three-tip sagebrush were
   browsed relative to their availability. However, within a species,
   smaller plant height and lower concentrations of phytochemicals,
   specifically two individual monoterpenes, explained diet selection by
   sage-grouse. Our results indicate that dietary quality of three-tip
   sagebrush may provide acceptable forage for sage-grouse in post-fire
   landscapes where other species of sagebrush have not yet recovered.
   However, relying on reestablishment of one species of sagebrush without

Abstract = {{Nowadays Earth observation satellites, in particular Landsat, provide a
   valuable help to forest managers in post-fire operations; being the base
   of post-fire damage maps that enable to analyze fire impacts and to
   develop vegetation recovery plans. Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument
   (MSI) records data in similar spectral wavelengths that Landsat 8
   Operational Land Imager (OLI), and has higher spatial and temporal
   resolutions. This work compares two types of satellite-based maps for
   evaluating fire damage in a large wildfire (around 8000 ha) located in
   Sierra de Gata (central-western Spain) on 6-11 August 2015. 1) burn
   severity maps based exclusively on Landsat data; specifically, on
   differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and on its relative versions
   (Relative dNBR, RdNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio, RBR) and 2) burn
   severity maps based on the same indexes but combining pre-fire data from

   Interpretation of ortho-photograph Pleiades 1 B data (1:10,000) provided

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the variations in the structure and composition of
   ant communities in burned Pinus nigra forests in central Catalonia (NE
   Spain). Pinus nigra forests do not recover after fire, changing to
   shrublands and oak coppices. For this reason, we suggest that ant
   communities of burned P. nigra forests will change after fire, because
   the post-fire scenario, in particular with the increase of open areas,
   is different to the unburned one, and more favourable for some species
   than for others. In four locations previously occupied by P. nigra
   forests where different fires occurred 1, 5, 13 and 19 yr before the
   sampling, we sampled the structure and composition of ant communities
   with pitfall traps, tree traps and net sweeping in unburned plots and in
   plots affected by canopy and understory fire. The results obtained
   suggest that canopy and understory fire had little effect on the
   structure of ant communities. Thus, many variables concerning ant
   communities were not modified either by fire type (understory or canopy
   fire) or by time since fire. However, a number of particular species
   were affected, either positively or negatively, by canopy fire: three
   species characteristic of forest habitats decreased after fire, while
   eight species characteristic of open habitats increased in areas
   affected by canopy fire, especially in the first few years after fire.
   These differences in ant community composition between burned and
   unburned plots imply that the maximum richness is achieved when there is
   a mixture of unburned forests and areas burned with canopy fire.
   Moreover, as canopy cover in P. nigra forests burned with canopy fire is
   not completed in the period of time studied, the presence of the species
   that are characteristic of burned areas remains along the chronosequence
   studied, while the species that disappear after fire do not recover in
   the period of time considered. Overall, the results obtained indicate
   that there is a persistent replacement of ant species in burned P. nigra
   forests, as is also the case with vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Does stand age influence the direction and rate of post-fire
   successional dynamics in coastal Calluna heaths and can old degraded
   heath vegetation be restored through reintroduction of fire?
   Location: Coastal heaths in the Tarva archipelago, central Norway.
   Methods: We investigated revegetation dynamics after experimental fires
   set in young (8 years since last fire) and old (> 50 years since last
   fire) grazed heath stands. A repeated measures design was used, with
   floristic data recorded in permanent plots in the post-fire successions
   (n = 12) over a 7-year period. The data were analysed using multivariate
   ordination techniques (PCA, RDA and PRC) and mixed effects models.
   Results: The age of Calluna stands strongly influenced post-fire
   succession, different trends due to age explained 10.4\% of variation in
   floristic data. Young heath showed faster succession towards pre-fire
   community composition than old heath, and this could partially be
   explained by succession-related factors: young heath had lower cover of
   mosses and lichens in the pre-burned vegetation, and lower cover of
   litter early in succession. Young heath had a less pronounced overall
   community response to fire than old heath. Vegetative regeneration of C.
   vulgaris was absent in both old and young heath, but Calluna still
   re-established as the dominant species within 5-7 years in both young
   and old stands. Regeneration dynamics were also affected by habitat
   conditions, different trends due to habitat explained 6\% of variation.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that old stands do develop
   characteristic heathland vegetation and structure after fire, and while
   potential invasives into the system such as trees and rhizomatous
   species are present, they do not impair Calluna regeneration or
   vegetation development towards the target heathland community
   composition and structure. Further, as our young stands are only in
   their second fire rotation after restoration, we suggest that
   characteristic dynamics of managed heathlands can re-establish
   relatively rapidly, even in severely degenerated sites (450 years since
   last fire). Site-specific factors also need to be considered. We
   conclude that there is restoration potential in old heaths, despite slow
   dynamics in the first rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change coupled with an intensifying wildfire regime is becoming
   an important driver of permafrost loss and ecosystem change in the
   northern boreal forest. There is a growing need to understand the
   effects of fire on the spatial distribution of permafrost and its
   associated ecological consequences. We focus on the effects of fire a
   decade after disturbance in a rocky upland landscape in the interior
   Alaskan boreal forest. Our main objectives were to (1) map near-surface
   permafrost distribution and drainage classes and (2) analyze the
   controls over landscape-scale patterns of post-fire permafrost
   degradation. Relationships among remote sensing variables and
   field-based data on soil properties (temperature, moisture, organic
   layer thickness) and vegetation (plant community composition) were
   analyzed using correlation, regression, and ordination analyses. The
   remote sensing data we considered included spectral indices from optical
   datasets (Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8
   Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the principal components of a time
   series of radar backscatter (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased
   Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS-PALSAR)), and
   topographic variables from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived
   digital elevation model (DEM). We found strong empirical relationships
   between the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and post-fire
   vegetation, soil moisture, and soil temperature, enabling us to
   indirectly map permafrost status and drainage class using
   regression-based models. The thickness of the insulating surface organic
   layer after fire, a measure of burn severity, was an important control
   over the extent of permafrost degradation. According to our
   classifications, 90\% of the area considered to have experienced high
   severity burn (using the difference normalized burn ratio (dNBR)) lacked
   permafrost after fire. Permafrost thaw, in turn, likely increased
   drainage and resulted in drier surface soils. Burn severity also
   influenced plant community composition, which was tightly linked to soil
   temperature and moisture. Overall, interactions between burn severity,
   topography, and vegetation appear to control the distribution of
   near-surface permafrost and associated drainage conditions after
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The future trajectory of forest ecosystems under climate change is
   heavily debated. Previous studies on the impacts of climate change on
   forest ecosystems have focused mainly on direct effects of altered
   climatic conditions, whereas interactions with disturbance events have
   been largely neglected. The aim of this study is to explore interactions
   of drought with fire disturbance and to assess their effects on tree
   species shifts in the European Central Alps. Tree recruitment after a
   stand replacing wildfire in the Rhone valley, Switzerland, was measured
   along an altitudinal temperature moisture gradient. Recruitment was more
   successful in pioneer species (Betula pendula, Populus tremula and Salix
   appendiculata) than in pre-fire stand forming (PFSF) species (Larix
   decidua, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris). Seedling and sapling density
   was not related to fire intensity, but it correlated with the distance
   to the forest edge in PFSF species. The window of opportunity for
   seedling establishment was short (1-2 years), and moisture deficit was
   the main limiting factor for tree recruitment at lower altitudes. We
   suggest that prolonged drought periods, as projected under continued
   global warming, will further aggravate tree recruitment success after
   fire disturbance at low altitudes of the Central Alps and may eventually
   lead to a shift from PFSF species to either more drought-tolerant
   species or to forest-free vegetation.}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires in boreal forest ecosystems usually spare tree stands called
   post-fire residual patches. There are two types of post-fire residual
   patches: (1) patches that only escaped fire by chance, probably due to
   local meteorological conditions unsuitable for fire spread at the moment
   fire reached their surroundings (random post-fire residual patches), and
   (2) patches with lower fire susceptibility, that escaped several
   consecutive fires, likely due to particular site characteristics (fire
   refuges). Special conservation efforts could target fire refuges owing
   to their old age, long ecological continuity, and potential specific
   biological diversity. Here we compared the stand characteristics of 13
   post-fire residual patches from the eastern Canadian boreal mixedwood
   forest to develop guidelines and information for forest managers to
   differentiate fire refuges from random post-fire residual patches. Two
   main structural characteristics differentiated fire refuges from random
   post-fire residual patches: mean tree diameter and thickness of the soil
   organic matter layer. Thick organic matter accumulation in fire refuges
   is likely linked to a paludification process, which in turn reduces
   stand productivity, and thus, mean tree diameter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Impacts of fire severity and post-fire reforestation on carbon pools in
   boreal larch forests in Northeast China}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Boreal larch (Larix gmelinii) forests in Northeast China have been
   widely disturbed since the 1987 conflagration; however, its long-term
   effects on the forest carbon (C) cycling have not been explored. The
   objective of this study thus was to quantify the effects of fire
   severity and post-fire reforestation on C pools and the changes of these
   forests.
   Methods
   Sixteen permanent plots have been set in two types of larch stands (L.
   gmelinii-grass, LG; and L. gmelinii-Rhododendron dahurica, LR) with
   three levels of fire severity (unburned, low-severity and high-severity
   but replanted), at 1987 burned sites in Daxing'anling, northeastern
   China, to repeatedly measure ecosystem C pools in 1998 and 2014. C
   components were partitioned into vegetation (foliage, branch, stem and
   roots), soil and detritus (standing and fallen woody debris and litter).
   The fire effects on post-fire C dynamics were examined by comparing the
   differences of C pools and changes between the two field investigations
   caused by fire severity.
   Important Findings
   During the study period, unburned mature stands were C sinks (105 g C
   m(-2) year(-1) for LG, and 190 g C m(-2) year(-1) for LR), whereas the
   low-severity stands were C-neutral (-4 and 15 g C m(-2) year(-1) for LG
   and LR, respectively). The high-severity burned but reforested stands
   were C sinks, among which, however, magnitudes (88 and 16 g C m(-2)
   year(-1) for LG and LR, respectively) were smaller than those of the two
   unburned stands. Detritus C pools decreased significantly (with a loss
   ranging from 26 to 38 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in the burned stands during
   recent restoration. Soil organic C pools increased slightly in the
   unmanaged stands (unburned and low-severity, with accumulation rates
   ranging from 4 to 35 g C m(-2) year(-1)), but decreased for the
   high-severity replanted stands (loss rates of 28 and 36 g C m(-2)
   year(-1) for LG and LR, respectively). These results indicate that fire
   severity has a dynamic post-fire effect on both C pools and
   distributions of the boreal larch forests, and that effective
   reforestation practice accelerates forest C sequestration.}},

Title = {{Changes in peat chemical properties during post-fire succession on
   blanket bog moorland}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{98-106}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study assessed the impact of prescribed burning on the peat
   properties of moorlands during the post-fire succession in a multi-site
   study within a major moorland region of Great Britain. Three replicate
   moorland sites were sampled; all were ombrotrophic bogs and had peat
   soils overlying similar geology and similar vegetation. A chronosequence
   approach was used to sample soils from a post-fire succession (3-52
   years since burning) on each site and a number of chemical properties
   measured. The data on soil chemical properties were analysed using both
   linear-mixed-effects modelling and multivariate analysis. There were
   clear differences in some soil properties between moorland sites, but
   for most soil variables measured there was no change through the
   post-fire succession. Four variables (available P and Ca; total P and K)
   showed a significant interaction, i.e. different responses on each
   moorland site through time. These results suggest that there are complex
   interactions between nutrient inputs (rainfall and dry deposition which
   is affected by elevation), storage and cycling within the soil-peat
   system and losses that differ on the three moorland sites. The most
   interesting result was the additive response of the C:N ratio which
   differed between moorland sites; all sites showed the same negative
   slope with respect to elapsed time since burning, indicating an
   increased N saturation. This result suggests that the oldest stands
   sampled here may have either (i) responded to the large N inputs added
   from the atmosphere in the latter part of the twentieth century, or (ii)
   the younger ones have had some of this N removed during prescribed
   burning. This suggestion needs further investigation. Nevertheless, the
   impacts of prescribed burning on the peat properties during the
   post-fire succession were relatively small. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   Severity}},
Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{Forest fires have a significant impact on hydrology, such as reduced
   infiltration rates leading to increased flooding. However, post-fire
   water balance changes and the competing hydrologic response of increased
   runoff and evapotranspiration as a function of burn severity are not
   well understood. Comparing pre- and post-fire water balance changes is
   challenging because measurements of fire-disturbed landscapes with the
   previously undisturbed character are impractical due to non-repetitive
   observational conditions. We used a physically based modeling experiment
   to incorporate burn severity data from the Las Conchas fire to
   approximate model parameterization to evaluate continuous water balance
   progression for pre- and post-fire simulations using the same forcing
   conditions. Fire disturbance decreased evapotranspiration and increased
   overland flow response to precipitation events. The reduction of
   evapotranspiration often dominated the new water balance compared with
   the increase in overland flow, resulting in higher soil moisture.
   However, this modeling experiment also identified a tipping point where
   increased overland flow from high burn severity sites eclipses the
   effect of reduced evapotranspiration on the water balance, causing
   comparatively drier post-fire soils. In particular, high burn severity
   sites approach a threshold that results in larger changes to overland
   flow than changes in evapotranspiration, potentially moving the site to
   an overland flow dominated regime. The shifts in water balance
   components have implications for how site conditions will change under a
   range of burn severity scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a natural phenomenon that is a common ecological factor in
   Mediterranean ecosystems. The increase in occurrence in recent decades
   has raised widespread concern about the impact of repeated wildfires on
   runoff and erosion, a topic that has not been widely studied. We
   addressed these concerns in an area of north-central Portugal by
   comparing runoff at the micro-plot scale and the associated transport of
   sediments and organic matter (OM) in unburnt, once burnt, and repeatedly
   burnt plantations of Maritime Pine. We selected nine sites following a
   large wildfire in September 2012 that affected roughly 3000 ha of the
   Viseu municipality. Three of the sites had not been burnt since 1975 and
   acted as controls, with covers of pine trees, shrubs, and annual
   vegetation; three sites had burnt only in 2012 and contained burnt pines
   but no shrubs or annual vegetation; and three degraded sites had
   suffered from three wildfires prior to 2012 and contained no vegetation.
   We established nine micro-plots (0.25 m(2)) at each site and collected
   runoff, eroded soil, and OM losses in tanks after each rain from October
   2012 to September 2014. The repeated wildfires strongly increased the
   runoff coefficient and the risk of downstream flooding after heavy
   rains. OM losses were nearly half the volume of the eroded soil in the
   degraded sites due to the transport of ash in the runoff. Runoff and
   soil losses occurred not only after erosive rainstorms following a fire
   but also after a subsequent period of drought. Soil cover, rain
   intensity, and soil moisture were key factors in the amount of runoff
   and erosion. The insights provided by this study can contribute to pre-
   and post-fire activities and management in protect areas and can thus
   improve post-fire recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of soil burn severity on initial establishment of maritime

   of two contrasting soils - an acid, coarse-textured soil, with high

   organic matter content - were experimentally burned to provide two
   markedly different levels of soil burn severity. The burned monoliths
   were sown with Pinus pinaster seeds and then placed in a greenhouse
   under a preselected water regime to determine the effect of burn
   severity on emergence and initial establishment of pine seedlings. High
   soil burn severity in the coarse-textured soils delayed germination,
   increased mortality and temporarily decreased the height of pine
   seedlings in the first year after sowing. This response was affected by:
   soil heating level, soil C consumption, post-fire soil C, depth of burn
   and post-fire duff-depth. Ash had no influence on the above processes.

Abstract = {{We examined vegetation change over time at managed and unmanaged oak

   Historical records indicate that white oak dominated the site and tree
   density was between 5 and 50 trees ha(-1). Management initiated in 1989
   included prescribed burning and woody plant removal. Vegetation was
   surveyed in 1988 and 1995. No significant change in total ground cover
   or in cover of native or exotic species (plants <1 m tall) was detected
   in 1995. However, herbaceous species as a percent of the total ground
   cover increased from 58\% in 1988 to 81\% in 1995. Woody species
   decreased from 42\% of the total cover in 1988 to only 19\% in 1995.
   Selected taxa-white snakeroot (Eupatorium rugosum), enchanter's
   nightshade (Circaea lutetiana), woodland knotweed (Polygonum
   virginianum), and oak species (Qeuercus spp.)-significantly increased in
   cover between the 1988 and 1995 surveys. Exotic shrubs decreased by 3139

   cover at the managed site did not change significantly between years. In
   contrast, at the unmanaged site (McClaughry Springs Forest Preserve),
   total ground cover (plants <1.4 m tall) significantly increased over
   four years, mostly due to increases in woody vegetation. Density of
   woody species in all size classes increased, and there was a significant
   increase in Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Invasive
   shrubs substantially increased in the suppressed (stems <1.4 m tall) and
   intermediate (stems >1.4 m tall but <11 cm dbh) layers. Management at

   eastern Australia from 2002 to 2013. Fires were analysed both
   individually and as groups. Fire weather was the most important
   predictor of crown consumption. TSF (a surrogate for fuel accumulation)
   had complex nonlinear effects that varied among fires. Crown fire
   likelihood was low up to 4 years post-fire, peaked at similar to 10
   years post-fire and then declined. There was no clear indication that
   recent burning became more or less effective as fire weather became more
   severe. Steeper slope reduced crown fire likelihood, contrary to the
   assumptions of common fire behaviour equations. More exposed areas
   (ridges and plains) had higher crown fire likelihood. Our results
   suggest prescribed burning to maintain an average of 10 years' TSF may
   actually increase crown fire likelihood, but burning much more
   frequently can be effective for risk reduction. Our results also suggest

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are the dominant disturbance agent in the Siberian larch
   forests. Extensive low-to mediate-intensity non-stand-replacing fires
   are a notable property of fire regime in these forests. Recent large
   scale studies of these fires have focused mostly on their impacts on
   carbon budget; however, their potential impacts on energy budget through
   post-fire albedo changes have not been considered. This study quantifies
   the post-fire surface forcing for Siberian larch forests that
   experienced non-stand-replacing fires between 2001 and 2012 using the
   full record of MODIS MCD43A3 albedo product and a burned area product
   developed specifically for the Russian forests. Despite a large
   variability, the mean effect of non-stand-replacing fires imposed
   through albedo is a negative forcing which lasts for at least 14 years.
   However, the magnitude of the forcing is much smaller than that imposed
   by stand-replacing fires, highlighting the importance of differentiating
   between the two fire types in the studies involving the fire impacts in
   the region. The results of this study also show that MODIS-based summer
   differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) provides a reliable metric for
   differentiating non-stand-replacing from stand-replacing fires with an
   overall accuracy of 88\%, which is of considerable importance for future
   work on modeling post-fire energy budget and carbon budget in the

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{119-136}},
Abstract = {{Forest fires fundamentally shape the habitats available for wildlife.
   Current predictions for fire under a warming climate suggest larger and
   more severe fires may occur, thus challenging scientists and managers to
   understand and predict impacts of fire on focal species, especially
   species of management concern. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus
   Erxleben) are a common and important prey animal in boreal forests and
   are the primary prey for the US federally threatened Canada lynx (Lynx
   canadensis Kerr), so understanding hare dynamics in post-fire landscapes
   is critical for managing lynx. We collected habitat and fecal pellet
   data from 114 sites across three natural burn treatments (mature forest,
   1988 Red Bench burn, and 1994 Adair and Howling burns) to evaluate
   impacts of fire and fire-habitat interactions on snowshoe hare in
   Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. We found that hare numbers were low
   throughout the park, with hares absent at 17 \% of surveyed sites and
   occurring at densities above 0.5 hares ha(-1) (a commonly suggested
   threshold for supporting Canada lynx) at only 7 \% of sites. Hare
   densities were variable but 10 to 20 times higher in regenerating
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) stands of 1988 Red
   Bench burn compared to lodgepole stands in other burn treatments. In
   stands dominated by other tree species, we found little difference in
   hare densities across burn treatments. Regardless of burn history or
   dominant canopy type, percent canopy cover was positively associated
   with hare relative abundance. Hare densities also increased with percent
   understory cover up to 80 \% cover, beyond which they began to decline.
   The regular occurrence of wildfires in Glacier National Park, with 2003
   being a particularly large fire year (the largest since 1910), suggest
   that hare and lynx distribution and abundance within the park may shift
   substantially in the coming decades as these animals respond to changing
   spatiotemporal patterns of regenerating forest.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances by fire are among the most important processes that shape
   forest dynamics and diversity. However, the long-term variability of
   fire disturbance regimes in many European forests and specifically in
   the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula is not well understood. Here, we
   present the first Holocene record of fire regimes based on macrocharcoal
   morphologies in combination with pollen-based reconstruction of forest
   dynamics and fire-related strategies of prevailing mountain forests in
   the Rila Mountains, Bulgaria. While biomass burning followed the main
   trends in climate, the frequency and intensity of fire were strongly
   linked to fire-related coping strategies of dominant tree taxa
   (resisters, avoiders or invaders). Frequent fires of low intensity
   between 12,000 and 9000 cal year BP were concurrent with the dominance
   of invaders (Betula, herbs, ferns). Intermittent occurrence of low- and
   high-intensity surface and crown fires with longer return intervals
   between 9000 and 4000 cal year BP was associated with codominance of
   resister (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus peuce, Pinus mugo) and avoider (Abies
   alba and Picea abies) forest types, whereas a lengthening of the fire
   return interval over the past 4000 years was linked to increased
   abundance of P. abies. As a rising number of fire episodes may drive
   land cover towards more fire-adapted plant communities and towards less
   intense fire events, we expect increased dominance of invaders
   (resprouters that rapidly reach maturity stage) as well as resisters
   (properties protecting from fire damage) under future warmer and drier
   climate. This study also shows the potential of combining charcoal
   morphologies with pollen records to track variability in fire intensity
   and plant functional attributes over long timescales that are also
   relevant to forest management stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{In periodically burned ecosystems, fire frequency may be an important

   developing three models of reproductive effort with time since last fire

   We then examined reproductive effort of five woody, resprouting shrubs
   at sites representing nine times since last fire (ranging from 0-64 yr).
   All species showed significant patterns with time since fire in
   percentage of stems reproductive and fruit production. Stems of all
   species needed to attain a minimum size before flowering. Four species
   had the greatest level of reproductive effort (fruit
   biomass/above-ground biomass) within 5 yr post-fire and best fit the
   Early Peak Model of reproductive effort (i.e. between-fire seedling
   recruitment or seed dormancy). A fifth species best fit the Broad Peak
   Model (i.e. immediate post-fire seedling establishment), peaking in
   reproductive effort at 7 yr post-fire. Both of these models are based on
   somewhat variable fire-return intervals, suggesting that the frequency
   of scrub fires may have been too unpredictable to select for
   reproductive allocation patterns precisely reflecting particular
   fire-return intervals. Early peaks in post-fire reproductive effort may
   be a bet-hedging strategy to allow for greater chances of seedling

Abstract = {{Mediterranean ecosystems are prone to wildfires, subsequent to which
   torrential rainfall and salvage logging are liable to modify soil
   properties. However, few studies to date have examined the impact of
   both types of disturbance on the same plot. The aim of this study is to
   examine the joint, medium-term effects of a torrential rainfall event,
   immediately following a wildfire, and post-fire salvage logging on the
   same plot. Three days after the wildfire we established and sampled an
   experimental plot (72 m(2)). The second sampling campaign was conducted
   4 days after the onset of an intense rainfall event and 7 days after the
   wildfire broke out. Six months after the wildfire, salvage logging was
   implemented using heavy machinery to extract burned logs. A third
   sampling campaign was conducted one year after the wildfire; and a
   fourth was carried out four years after the event. In each campaign, 30
   points, spaced 2 m apart, were sampled at a depth of 0-5 cm. Soil
   properties analyzed included soil water repellency (SWR), aggregate
   stability (AS), infiltration rate (in mm/h), soil organic matter (SOM),
   total nitrogen (TN), inorganic carbon (IC), C/N ratio, pH, electrical
   conductivity (EC), extractable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium

   refers to ammonium acetate extractable fraction and soil available P
   refers to plant available P. Post-fire rainfall affected pH, EC, Ca, Mg,

   Mn, Fe, Zn, Cr, P and Si in the short term and IC, Ca, Al, Mn, Zn, Cr
   and B in the medium term. The post-fire occurrence of torrential

Abstract = {{Forest fires can have significant effects on the hydrological response
   of catchments, resulting in many cases in severe land degradation,
   flooding and soil erosion. These post-fire hazards often cause extensive
   damage to public and private property and urban infrastructure, thus
   carefully planned and designed mitigation activities are required for
   reducing their magnitude. This study presents a method for the
   quantitative estimation and mapping of post-fire erosion and runoff,
   which can provide the basis for the planning of these mitigation
   activities. Within the context of the proposed method a soil-erosion
   model is integrated within a GIS and remote sensing and digital
   cartographic data are used for estimating the model parameters before
   and after the passage of the fire. The model incorporates the effects of
   fire on the parameters that control erosion using remotely sensed
   estimates of the characteristics of the fire, such as the temperature
   and the extent. The method was implemented in four regions in Greece
   where severe wildfires took place during the summer of 1998. Pre- and
   post-fire model runs showed significant changes in runoff and erosion
   patterns as a result of the passage of the fire and a notable increase
   in the spatial variability of post-fire erosion rates. Results indicated
   net increases of up to 0.76 x 10(-2) mm/h in erosion rates, although
   small decreases were also observed in some areas. The application of the
   method led to the identification of areas where erosion is expected to
   accelerate significantly and thus hazard-mitigation works are urgently
   required. The proposed method can clearly benefit from higher resolution
   remote-sensing data and more detailed datasets on soil properties and
   characteristics and is expected to provide a useful tool in planning and
   prioritising the works that are required for the mitigation of post-fire
   hazards. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the responses of natural communities to disturbances
   remains a challenging task in ecology. In northwestern Patagonia, the
   most important disturbances are fire and introduced ungulates. Although
   these disturbances have been present in this region since late eighteen

   Here, we examined the short-term response of ground beetles (Coleoptera)

   (cattle and no cattle) in post-fire forests. We collected ground beetles
   with pitfall traps and estimated beetle abundance, species richness,
   assemblage composition, abundance of trophic guilds and beetle
   characteristic species, and measured some habitat parameters. We found
   that burnt browsed forest had lower diversity and different assemblage
   composition than unburnt forest. Beetle abundance, assemblage
   composition and abundance of trophic guilds were similar in post-fire
   forests with and without cattle browsing. Conversely, beetle species
   richness was higher in cattle than in no cattle forests. Fire had a
   strong negative effect on beetle diversity probably by its effect
   changing habitat structure. Whereas fire had a homogenizing influence on
   beetle diversity with and without cattle, at small-spatial scales,
   browsing of cattle probably generate habitat heterogeneity enhancing
   beetle richness. The implementation of policies aimed to reduce the risk

Abstract = {{The need to understand how forest management practices affect soil CO2
   exchange with the atmosphere (soil respiration) has increased with the
   recognition of a likely feedback effect of climate warming on soil
   respiration rates. Previous research addressing the mechanisms driving
   soil respiration has yielded inconsistent and/or conflicting results.
   This study looked to alternative above-ground forest characteristics to
   help explain spatial variability in soil respiration in a 30-year-old
   Sierra Nevada pine plantation. Fire hazard mitigation is one of the
   predominant management goals in these and other western US forests.
   Therefore, this analysis examined how fuels treatments, including
   shredding of understory vegetation (mastication), prescribed fire, and a
   combination thereof, affected soil respiration and its relationship to
   environmental factors and post-fire tree injuries. Multiple regression
   models indicated that mastication had no significant impact on soil
   respiration, but the roles of soil temperature and forest floor depth (O
   horizons) in the models increased after the treatment. Burning reduced
   soil respiration by similar to 14\%, and increased its sensitivity to
   tree proximity and the exposure of bare mineral soil. Scorch height in
   burned stands was negatively correlated with soil respiration. Models
   incorporating only tree injury or tree proximity parameters explained
   between 63\% and 91\% of the variability in burned plantations. This
   work suggests that measures of above-ground forest features can increase
   understanding of management impacts on soil respiration, and the
   mechanisms by which these impacts occur. These results are especially
   applicable in Mediterranean climates, where moisture stress reduces the
   effectiveness of soil microclimate in explaining soil respiration.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the recovery of Pinus pinea in forested areas that

   (i) to analyze the success of the regeneration of P pinea in areas with
   the presence or absence of surviving adult trees and (ii) to investigate
   whether or not the post-fire response of P pinea may affect its present

   regeneration of P. pinea seedlings in 8 areas burned by wildfires in
   Catalonia (northeast Spain) between 1979 and 2001. This study shows that
   the inability of seedlings to establish after fire, together with the
   short seed dispersal distance of this species and the low level of
   seedling survival, renders the natural regeneration of P pinea in burned
   areas difficult. A comparison of the presence of P. pinea in plots
   located in burned and unburned areas throughout its distribution area in
   Catalonia indicates that its presence at the regional level is clearly
   reduced after fire. Moreover, in the areas where it persists, tree
   density and cover are smaller than in unburned areas. This decrease of
   P. pinea forests is exacerbated by the increase in surface area burned
   by forest fires during recent decades in the Mediterranean basin and by
   decreasing profits associated with this species as a consequence of the

Abstract = {{Nicotiana attenuata is a post-fire annual that utilizes
   jasmonate-inducible nicotine production as an inducible chemical defense
   which, in turn, can utilize 6\% of a plant's nitrogen budget and be
   costly to seed production. We characterize the nitrogen pools of burned
   soils in the plant's native environment (pinyon-juniper woodlands) and
   examine how variation in nitrogen source and supply rate influence the
   patterns of allocation to growth and inducible and constitutive nicotine
   production. Available soil nitrogen increases dramatically (40-fold)
   immediately after a fire and consists principally of ammonia which is
   subsequently oxidized to nitrate during post-fire succession. We
   simulate these changes in nitrogen availability in hydroponic culture
   and use allometric techniques to characterize changes in allocation. In
   two experiments, we alter (1) nitrate supply rates 8-fold and (2) the
   ratio of ammonia:nitrate under consistent nitrogen supply rates. In both
   experiments, we increase the allocation to nicotine by treating roots
   with methyl jasmonate (MJ), the methyl ester of the plant's internal
   wound signal, jasmonic acid, which increases nicotine production in the
   roots after shoot herbivory. MJ treatments decrease whole plant (WP)
   growth, increase root:shoot ratio, and increase WP nicotine pools in all
   nitrogen environments. Overall, source and supply rate of nitrogen have
   no effect on either the constitutive or induced allometric relationships
   of nicotine accumulation and growth. This remarkable homeostasis in
   allocation patterns contradicts a key prediction of carbon nutrient
   (C/N) theory. With N-15-pulse-chase techniques, we demonstrate that
   plants preferentially utilize ammonia for nicotine production over
   nitrate when both nitrogen sources are available. This preferential use
   of ammonia may allow N. attenuata to reduce the biochemical costs of
   producing nicotine in the post-fire environment.}},

Abstract = {{Species of Mediterranean vegetation are known to regenerate directly
   after fire. The phenomenon of autosuccession (direct regeneration) has
   been found to be often combined with an increase of species richness
   during the first years after fire due to the high abundance of
   short-lived herbaceous plants facilitated by plentiful nutrients and
   light. The high degree of vegetation resilience, which is expressed in
   terms of autosuccession, has been explained by the selective pressure of
   fire in historic times. According to existing palaeoecological data,
   however, the Pinus halepensis forests in the Ricote Mountains (Province
   of Murcia, SE Spain) did not experience substantial fire impact before
   the presence of man nor are they especially fire-prone today. Therefore,
   we studied post-fire regeneration to find out if direct succession is
   present or if species from pre-fire vegetation are absent during the
   post-fire regeneration stages. Patterns of succession were deduced from
   observations made in sample plots on sites of a known regeneration age
   as well as in adjacent unburnt areas. The results of the vegetation
   analyses, including a Detrended Correspondence Analysis, indicate that
   Pinus halepensis forest regeneration after fire resembles
   autosuccession. As regards the presence of woody species, there is a
   high percentage similarity on north (83\%) and south (70\%) facing
   slopes during the first year after fire vs. reference areas which is
   due, for example, to direct regeneration of the resprouting Quercus
   coccifera or seeders like Pinus halepensis or Fumana laevipes. However,
   if herbaceous species are included in the comparison, the similarity on
   north-facing sites decreases (to 53\%) with the presence of additional
   species, mainly ruderals like Anagallis arvensis or Reseda phyteuma, and
   even woody species on the burnt plots. This effect indicates ``enhanced
   autosuccession{''}, which was not found on south-facing sites where
   overall species richness was very high irrespective of the impact of
   fire. Locally we found limited regeneration of some species, for example
   Pinus halepensis at high altitudes (1000 m), even 22 years after fire.
   As we assume that historical fires did not play an important role in the
   area and direct succession is present nevertheless, our results support
   the theory that autosuccession is not a process restricted to fire-prone
   areas. Fire has been only one of several selective forces since human
   settlement that probably led to a set of species pre-adapted against
   recurrent disturbance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

   vertebrate fauna (birds. mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29
   standardized 50 x 50-m quadrats in the 2001 wet season. representing
   Four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2 y) and grazed by cattle
   (4-8 ha per livestock unit): sites unburnt (last burnt > 2 y ago) and
   grazed: sites burnt recently and ungrazed: and unburn and ungrazed
   sites. Fire and grazing had a significant influence on vegetation: both
   grazing and fire reduced ground cover (fire in grazed sites 51-23\%,
   tire in ungrazed sites 68-39\%)) and increased the cover of forbs (8\%,
   in burnt and grazed sites, 3\%, if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20\%)
   in grazed and unburnt sites and 5\%) when ungrazed). Grazing caused a
   shift in floristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda
   pungens to tussock grasses (e.g. Aristida spp.. Enneapogon spp.), forbs
   (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate

   grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction (2 species).
   Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon

   or change in vegetation architecture (e.g. singing honeyeater
   Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The
   clearest example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary
   dominance between the rodents Pseudomys delicatulus and P. desertor, the
   latter's post-fire recovery becoming more muted in sites where cattle
   grazed (modelled time for population recovery twice as long as in
   ungrazed sites).}},

Abstract = {{A geochemical and end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) is undertaken in
   Devil Canyon catchment, located in southern California, to further
   understanding of watershed behaviour and Source water contributions
   after an acute and extensive wildfire. Physical and chemical
   transformations in post-fire watersheds are known to increase overland
   flow and decrease infiltration, mainly due to formation of a hydrophobic
   layer at, or near, the soil surface. However, less is known about
   subsurface flow response in burned watersheds. The current study
   incorporates EMMA to evaluate and quantify source water contributions
   before, and after, a catchment affected by wildfires in southern
   California during the fall of 2003. Pre- and post-fire stream water data
   were available at several sampling sites within the catchment, allowing
   the identification of contributing water sources at varying spatial
   scales. Proposed end-member observations (groundwater. overland flow,
   shallow subsurface flow) were also collected to constrain and develop
   the catchment mixing model. Post-fire source water changes are more
   evident in the smaller and faster responding sub-basin (interior
   sampling point). Early post-fire storm events are dominated by overland
   flow with no significant soil water or groundwater flow contribution.
   Inter-storm streamwater in this smaller basin shows an increase in
   groundwater and a decrease in soil water. In the larger,
   baseflow-dominated system, source water components appear less affected
   by fire. A slight increase in lateral flow is observed with only a
   slight decrease in baseflow. Changes in the post-fire flow regimes

Title = {{Survival behaviour of swamp wallabies during prescribed burning and
   wildfire}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Abstract = {{Context. Prescribed (or controlled) burning is frequently advocated as a
   means of reducing fuel loads in peri-urban forests to minimise the risk
   of high-intensity wildfires. An important consideration in prescribed
   burns is the impact on native wildlife.
   Aims. An opportunity arose to follow the movements of radio-collared
   peri-urban swamp wallabies during a prescribed burn and after an
   unexpected wildfire in the same location a short time later. Movement
   data was used to assess the relative impacts of the prescribed burn and
   wildfire on mortality, emigration and habitat use; the behavioural
   responses and methods of avoidance used by swamp wallabies in response
   to an oncoming fire front; and the management implications for wildlife
   that inhabit fire-prone habitats in proximity to human settlement where
   wildfire mitigation is necessary.
   Methods. Here we report on the movements of radio-collared swamp
   wallabies, Wallabia bicolor, before, during and after a prescribed fire
   and after a wildfire on the same site 6 months later.
   Key results. No radio-collared swamp wallabies were killed during the
   prescribed burn and only one wallaby was observed to emigrate from the
   area post-fire. This contrasted to the wildfire where one wallaby died
   during or just after the fire and another perished in the post-fire
   environment a few months later. The wildfire also increased emigration
   post-fire.
   Conclusions. We demonstrate that wallabies can avoid fire fronts and
   that this avoidance behaviour may be more successful during cooler
   fires. The prescribed burn provided a suitable habitat for wallabies but
   did not result in a shift in habitat preference.
   Implications. Mitigation of the impact of prescribed burns on swamp
   wallabies may be achieved by allowing sufficient time for habitat
   complexity to re-establish between burns.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What is the relative importance of fire-induced canopy

   Location: Subalpine Nothofagus pumilio forests at Challhuaco valley (41
   degrees 13'S. 71 degrees 19'W), Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina.
   Methods: We fenced and transplanted soils of three burning severities
   alone a fire severity gradient produced by a fire in 1996. Over two
   growing seasons we monitored soil water, direct incoming solar
   radiation, seedling survival, final seedling total biomass and
   root/shoot ratio. Additionally, we assessed severity-related changes in
   soil properties.
   Results: Incoming radiation (an indicator of the amount of canopy cover
   left by the fire) was the primary factor influencing spring and summer
   top soil water availability, first and second-year seedling survival and
   seedling growth. While seedling survival and soil water content were
   negatively affected by increased radiation, seedling final biomass was
   highest in very open microsites. Burned soils showed lower water holding
   capacity and soil carbon; however these changes did not affect topsoil
   water, and, contrary to expectation, there was a slight tendency toward
   higher seedling survival on more heavily burned soils. Herbivory
   significantly reduced seedling survival, but only under high-radiation
   conditions. While the effect of radiation on final seedling biomass was
   not affected by herbivory, R/S ratios were significantly reduced by
   herbivory in high radiation microsites.
   Conclusions: Despite inducing faster aerial growth, increased radiation
   and herbivory in severely burned sites may effectively prevent post-fire
   regeneration in north Patagonian subalpine forest where seed sources are

Abstract = {{Aims
   Recognizing ungulate browsing thresholds between viable and declining
   aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands are critical to ensuring
   long-term persistence of this biologically important plant community.
   Studies have shown declines in vigor and regeneration when as few as
   30\% of current annual twigs are browsed while other studies have shown
   higher limits. Although the effects of ungulate herbivory are of concern
   in aspen forests, few studies have assessed browsing effects following
   wildfire and few criteria exist for determining potential effects of
   ungulate browsing on aspen forests following wildfire. We evaluated the
   effects of ungulate abundance and foraging intensity on regenerating
   aspen 1 to 6 years post-fire and assessed the use of abundance and
   foraging intensity indicators in predicting impacts to regenerating
   aspen. Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelson) was the primary
   ungulate in the study area.
   Methods
   The study area was located within the 17 500 ha Cerro Grande Fire burn
   area in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, USA. We used percent aspen
   twigs browsed and pellet-group counts to evaluate relationships between
   these indicators and aspen patch structure (height, size). We collected
   data in randomly generated 3 x 33 m plots 5-6 years post-fire. We also
   established 4 fenced exclosures (25 x 55 m and 3.3 m in height) with
   paired unfenced plots 1-year post-fire to monitor aspen regeneration.
   Each spring, we recorded percent browsed twigs from the previous fall
   through the early spring period which coincided with the highest
   ungulate use period within the study area. We assessed associations
   between percent twigs browsed and pellet-group density and patch size
   and height of aspen using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
   Important Findings
   Mean percent twigs browsed and ungulate pellet-group density across the
   burn area was <= 31\% and 1 pellet-group 100 sq m(-1), respectively.
   Patch size and height decreased with increasing browsing and
   pellet-group density 5-6 years post-fire. However, mean aspen heights
   were approaching or exceeding a minimum browsing level of 2 m and,
   therefore, ungulate browsing did not appear sufficient to cause
   significant impacts to aspen across the burn area. We observed a
   positive correlation between pellet-group density and twig browsing
   suggesting that one or both measures could be used to assess potential
   effects of browsing on regenerating aspen following fire.}},

Abstract = {{The natural regeneration of non-serotinous Spanish black pine (Pinus
   nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii) is known to be null or limited after severe
   wildfires. However, it remains challenging to define efficient
   management strategies within the burnt area, which can help to increase
   the post-fire resilience of this species. We conducted a direct seeding
   experiment during 2011-2015 to assess the effect of different post-fire
   management treatments (control, soil ripping, woodchips, and soil
   ripping + woodchips) performed in opposite slope-aspects (north- and
   south-facing) on pine emergence, seed predation, survival, growth, and
   biomass allocation during the early stages of seedling development (1-5
   years) after a severe wildfire. Our results showed that the slope-aspect
   did not have an important effect in both the seedling emergence and seed
   predation rates. In contrast, the influence of slope-aspect was
   significant as both survival and growth of pine seedlings were reduced
   at the south-facing slope-aspect compared to the north-facing
   slope-aspect due to harsher environmental conditions. A variable and
   reduced impact on seedling emergence and seed predation rates was
   induced by both soil ripping and woodchips treatments. Overall,
   post-fire management treatments helped to enhance survival rates during
   early growth stages, although this effect was short-lasting. This
   knowledge can be used to define post-fire seeding management strategies
   oriented to enhance the resilience of severely burnt pine forest stands;
   therefore, while both the soil ripping and woodchips treatments might
   not be practices leading to increase their post-fire regeneration,
   direct seeding at north-facing slope-aspects could be a more appropriate
   management strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Quercus ilex and Pinus halepensis are two of the most common tree
   species of the western Mediterranean basin. Both species regenerate
   reliably after fire: P. halepensis colonizes recently disturbed areas by
   effective seedling recruitment, while Q. ilex resprouts vigorously after
   disturbances. For this reason, the natural regeneration of these species
   after fire should ensure the re-establishment of a forest similar to
   that which existed before the fire. This study analyzes with a simple
   simulation model whether or not the relative abundance of monospecific
   and mixed forests of these species in the landscape is altered by fire.
   We also analyze the topographic factors and the forest structure before
   the fire that determine the changes in forest composition after fire.
   This study has been carried out in a large fire that occurred in NE
   Spain. Overall, 33\% of plots changed to another community type, but
   this probability of change varied considerably among community types
   before the fire. Monospecific forests of P. halepensis or Q. ilex had a
   high probability of remaining in their original composition after the
   fire, whereas the resilience of mixed forests of these two species was
   quite low. Mixed forests changed for the most part to monospecific P.
   halepensis or Q. ilex forests. Analysis of several factors determining
   these changes indicated that only elevation as a significant
   topographical variable. The effect of fire was to increase the
   altitudinal differentiation between the two species. P. halepensis
   forests that changed to mixed or Q. ilex forests were those of highest
   elevation, while the mixed and Q. ilex plots that changed to P.
   halepensis forests were those located at the lowest elevations.
   Concerning structural variables before fire, density of Q. ilex trees
   before the fire showed a much greater effect than P. halepensis density
   in determining the post-fire community. Finally, burn severity also
   influenced the changes observed. For both P. halepensis and Q. ilex
   forests, plots that changed to another forest type were mainly those
   that burned more severely. In the case of mixed forests, even low fire
   severities involved high probabilities of change to monospecific
   forests.}},

   were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently

   richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird
   species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species
   composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and
   Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland
   attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and
   Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the
   majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact
   affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on

Title = {{Experimental burning changes the quality of fallen timber as habitat for
   vertebrate and invertebrate fauna: implications for fire management}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{574-581}},
Abstract = {{Context. Fallen timber is a key habitat feature in forests and woodlands
   for vertebrate and invertebrate fauna, and is either consumed or left
   partially burnt after the passage of fire. This impact on habitat
   quality assumes significance because increasing areas of land are
   subject to frequent hazard-reduction burning and wildfire in eastern
   Australia.
   Aims. We test here whether partially burnt or charred fallen timber is
   employed as habitat to the same extent as unburnt fallen timber.
   Methods. Vertebrate and invertebrate abundance beneath burnt and unburnt
   fence posts was monitored for 13 months in unburnt forest and forest
   burnt by a wildfire.
   Key results. Both vertebrate and invertebrate fauna made significantly
   less use of charred refuges. In most taxa, twice as many animals
   occurred under unburnt as under burnt artificial timber refuges, ant
   nests being the exception. Fauna made greater use of experimental
   refuges in burnt forest.
   Key conclusions. Partially burnt fallen-timber refuges, where the log
   surface is left charred, are inferior habitat for fauna. Habitat quality
   in burnt forest may be enhanced by introducing fallen timber.
   Implications. The study highlights an ecological consequence of fire for
   habitat quality, whether through wildfire or hazard-reduction burning,
   which should be considered in fire management.}},

   severity also favoured seed dispersal. Relative germination success
   increased with soil burn severity whereas initial and final seedling

   positive influence of fire severity on the final/initial seedling
   density and final density/total seed dispersal ratios was also observed.
   Different post-fire management options were used at each experimental

Abstract = {{Increasing fire recurrence is a major problem threatening
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Moreover, this pattern is predicted to
   increase owing to global change. Although a reduction in the density and
   growth of post-fire regeneration is usually observed in recurrently
   burnt areas, the potential effects on reproductive ability have seldom

   structural changes induced by fire recurrence may constrain reproduction
   ability of Pinus halepensis forests. We conducted the current study in
   Catalonia (NE Spain) in 12 study sites, consisting of two adjacent areas
   differing in the number of fire events suffered throughout the last 16
   years (one v. two fires). Twice-burnt areas showed a lower density of
   pines, lower pine height and a lower reproductive ability, namely (i) a
   3-year delay in the onset of pine reproduction; (ii) a reduction of 52\%
   in the number of reproductive pines; and (iii) a 36\% lower mean cone
   crop per tree. The lower mean cone production per tree coupled with a
   lower density resulted in an similar to 80\% lower canopy seed bank in

Abstract = {{Fire may cause significant alterations in soil properties. Post-fire
   soil dynamics can vary depending, among other factors, on rainfall
   patterns. However, little is known regarding variations in response to
   post-fire drought This is relevant in arid and semiarid areas with poor
   soils, like much of the western Mediterranean. Furthermore, climate
   change projections in such areas antitipate reduced precipitation and
   longer annual drought periods, together with an increase in fire
   severity and frequency. This research evaluates the effects of
   experimental drought after fire on soil dynamics of a Cistus-Erica
   shrubland (Central Spain). A replicated (n = 4) field experiment was
   conducted in which the total rainfall and its patterns were manipulated
   by means of a rain-out shelters and irrigation system. The treatments
   were: environmental control (natural rainfall), historical control
   (average rainfall, 2 months drought), moderate drought (25\% reduction
   of historical control, 5 months drought) and severe drought (45\%
   reduction, 7 months drought). After one growing season under these
   rainfall treatments, the plots were burned. One set of unburned plots
   under natural rainfall served as an additional control. Soils were
   collected seasonally. Fire increased soil P arid N availability.
   Post-fire drought treatments reduced available soil P but increased N
   concentration (mainly nitrate). Fire reduced available K irrespective of
   drought treatments. Fire reduced enzyme activities and carbon
   mineralization rate, a reduction that was higher in post-fire drought
   treated soils. Fire decreased soil microbial biomass and the proportion
   of fungi, while that of actinomycetes increased. Post-fire drought
   decreased soil total microbial biomass and fungi, with bacteria becoming
   more abundant. Our results support that increasing drought after fire
   could compromise the resilience of Mediterranean ecosystems to fire. (C)

   The region was explored between 1817 and 1836. Settlers, foresters and
   ecologists described changes as Aboriginal culture was displaced,
   domestic stock, feral animals and exotic plants were introduced, rabbits
   were controlled, rivers were regulated, and grazing was reduced. The
   Aboriginal ecosystems were different to the new red gum (Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis) and white cypress (Callitris columellaris) forests which
   lack resilience. Trees, saplings, fallen timber, shrubs and parasitic
   plants have accumulated in recently `undisturbed' sites and these
   features are now promoted as benchmarks for conservation. However, human
   activity including watering, thinning, firewood collection, grazing

Abstract = {{Boreal forest development is influenced by both natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances that alter stand structure and nutrient
   cycling over decadal timescales. The effects of disturbance on boreal
   forests is likely to be modified by soil moisture, given that
   disturbance severity, vegetation structure and plant productivity vary
   between upland and lowland forest stands. Future changes in boreal
   vegetation dynamics are predicted to have consequences for a range of
   ecosystem services including climate feedbacks and wildlife management.
   Here, as part of a broader study on habitat use and forage of woodland
   caribou, we investigated the effects of soil drainage class (upland vs.
   lowland), disturbance (wildfire vs. timber harvest), and stand age on
   understory plant species richness, cover, biomass, productivity, and
   foliar C/N. Due to faster nutrient turnover rates in upland soils, we
   predicted that understory vegetation in uplands would be more
   productive, biodiverse and nutrient-rich than in lowlands. We also
   expected disturbance to lead to greater changes in understory vegetation
   in uplands, given that both fire and timber harvesting tend to be more
   severe in drier ecosystems. Our results showed that plant understory
   characteristics varied primarily between soil drainage classes, with few
   differences between stands recovering from wildfire or timber
   harvesting. Contrary to our predictions, lowland understory vegetation
   had greater total understory plant species richness, aboveground net
   primary productivity, and foliar C/N compared to upland understory
   vegetation. We also found no difference in total understory vegetation
   percent cover, productivity or foliar C/N between burned and harvested
   stands. Understory net primary productivity decreased with time
   following disturbance in uplands but increased nonlinearly with stand
   age in lowlands. Greater productivity in lowlands was attributed
   primarily to evergreen shrubs, though graminoids also were more
   productive in lowlands than in uplands. Our study has implications for
   the threatened woodland caribou with respect to the nutritional aspects
   of their habitat selection. Our results suggest that the commonly held
   assertion that, by selecting lowlands, caribou face a trade-off between
   lower predation risk and lower forage quality may be incorrect and
   requires further examination. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Over a century of fire exclusion in frequent-fire ponderosa pine and dry

   Research is needed to determine post-fire vegetation response thus

   white fir seedlings or saplings in a second-entry, low-severity burn in

   effective in reducing white fir densities in the white fir encroachment
   forest type. There was significant aspen regeneration following
   high-severity fire in the dry mixed conifer forest type. This research

Abstract = {{The tallgrass prairie (Andropogon-Panicum) of central North America and
   the spinifex (Triodia) grasslands of the Gibson Desert of central
   Western Australia differ substantially in many ways, including in their
   responses to fire, but are similar in that both confirm the importance
   of fire in maintaining ecosystem diversity. In tallgrass prairie, the
   historic fire return interval is estimated to have averaged 3-5 y, most
   likely dominated by large-scale dormant-season fires with more frequent
   but smaller growing-season fires. Fires were initiated by both Native
   Americans and lightning, with effects most likely heterogeneous due to
   factors such as patchy grazing of large grazers that altered fuel
   continuity. Fire in this ecosystem prevented extensive woody plant
   invasion and maintained a diverse plant community by invigorating the
   perennial prairie plants and by facilitating seedling germination and
   establishment. In the spinifex grassland of the Gibson Desert of central
   Western Australia, an ecosystem interspersed with bands of mulga (Acacia
   aneura), the frequency of historic fires is not as well known.
   Aboriginal and lightning-caused fires are reported to have maintained
   much of the landscape as a patchwork of different post-fire successional
   states presumably supporting a diverse flora and fauna. In contrast to
   the tallgrass prairie, grazers are not likely to have influenced fire
   heterogeneity because the dominant grass (Triodia basedowii), which is
   highly flammable even when green, appears unpalatable to any organism
   except termites. Further, in contrast to the post-fire resprouting of
   perennial plants of the tallgrass prairie, T. basedowii and most other
   plants of the spinifex grassland do not survive fire, instead
   regenerating from seeds dependent largely on post-fire rainfall. Thus,
   fuel accumulation and continuity in the spinifex grasslands, and
   consequently fire frequency, would have been dictated mostly by
   post-burn growing conditions. In addition, plant diversity in the
   spinifex grasslands results from the release of buried seed following
   fire-caused death of T. basedowii hummocks. The dramatic post-fire
   increase in plant diversity, which declines to pre-burn conditions
   within 5 y, is in sharp contrast to the maintenance of diversity
   afforded by fire in the tallgrass prairie. Thus, the means by which
   diversity is maintained in the tallgrass and spinifex grasslands differs
   substantially-maintenance versus cyclic replacement-but in both types of
   grasslands, fire is the central player. Not unexpectedly, the dynamics
   of both ecosystems are threatened by alteration of the historic fire
   regimes, with one consequence an apparent decline in plant (and perhaps
   animal) diversity.}},

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{117-132}},
Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in evaluating whether recent wildfires in
   dry conifer forests of western North America are burning with
   uncharacteristic severity. that is, with a severity outside the
   historical range of variability. In 2002, the Hayman Fire burned an
   unlogged 3400 ha dry conifer forest landscape in the Colorado Front
   Range, USA, that had been the subject of previous fire history and
   forest age structure research. We opportunistically leveraged
   pre-existing data from this research, in combination with post-fire
   aerial imagery, to provide insight into whether the Hayman Fire's
   patterns of high-severity, stand-replacing fire effects were
   uncharacteristic. Living old overstory trees were well distributed and
   abundant in the landscape before the Hayman Fire, despite the fact that
   some stand-replacing burning had been a component of the landscape's
   historical mixed-severity fire regime. Of 106 randomly selected stand
   polygons that were sampled for the age of the oldest living overstory
   tree prior to the fire, 30\% contained only trees <200 yr, while 70\%
   contained at least one tree >200 yr and 29\% contained at least one tree
   >400 yr. Following the Hayman Fire, only 5\% of the polygons contained
   any living trees; these polygons were all immediately adjacent to the
   reservoir in the center of the landscape. At most, 4 \% of the polygons
   contained one or more trees >200 yr post fire, and 3 \% contained one or
   more trees >400 yr. The nearly complete loss of old trees, most of which
   were located in areas with evidence of past non-stand-replacing burning,
   leads us to conclude that the amount and extent of stand-replacing
   burning within the Hayman Fire were uncharacteristic for this landscape
   over at least the last two to four centuries.}},

Abstract = {{A century of fire suppression culminated in wildfire on 28 October 2003
   that stand-replaced nearly an entire 4000 ha ``sky island{''} of mixed
   conifer forest (MCF) on Cuyamaca Mountain in the Peninsular Range of
   southern California. We studied the fire affected Cuyamaca Rancho State
   Park (CRSP), which represents a microcosm of the MCF covering
   approximately 5.5 x 10(6) ha (14\%) of California, to evaluate how fire
   suppression unintentionally destabilizes this ecosystem. We document
   significant changes in forest composition, tree density, and stem
   diameter class distribution over a 75-year period at CRSP by replicating
   ground-based measurements sampled in 1932 for the Weislander Vegetation
   Type Map (VTM) survey. Average conifer density more than doubled, from
   271 +/- 82 trees ha(-1) (standard error) to 716 +/- 79 ha(-1). Repeat
   aerial photographs for 1928 and 1995 also show significant increase in
   canopy cover from 47 +/- 2\% to 89 +/- 1\%. Changes comprise mostly
   ingrowth of shade-tolerant Calocedrus decurrens {[}Torr.] Floren. in the
   smallest stem diameter class (10-29.9 cm dbh). The 1932 density of
   overstory conifer trees (>60 cm dbh) and 1928 canopy cover at CRSP were
   similar to modern MCF in the Sierra San Pedro Martir (SSPM), similar to
   200 km S in Baja California, Mexico, where fire suppression had not been
   practiced, verifying that the historical data from the early twentieth
   century represent a valid ``baseline{''} for evaluating changes in
   forest structure. Forest successions after modern crown fires in
   southern California demonstrate that MCF is replaced by oak woodlands
   and shrubs. Post-fire regeneration in severely burned stands at CRSP
   includes abundant basal sprouting of Quercus; chrysolepis Liebm. and
   Quercus kelloggii Newb., but only few seedlings of Abies concolor
   {[}Gord. and Glend.] Lindl (average 16 +/- 14 ha(-1)), while whole
   stands of C decurrens, Pinus lambertiana Dougl., and Pinus ponderosa
   Laws. were extirpated. Prescribed burning failed to mitigate the crown
   fire hazard in MCF at CRSP because the low-intensity surface fires were
   small relative to the overall forest area, and did not thin the dense
   understory of sapling and pole-size trees. We propose that larger, more
   intense prescribed understory burns are needed to conserve California's
   MCF. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   in repellency were observed between the grass and chaparral sites. In
   general, soil water repellency increased with depth, decreased with time
   following the fire, and was inversely related to soil moisture content
   (i.e., least repellent during the winter and most repellent during the
   summer). Reduction in repellency occurred at moisture contents ranging
   between 8\% to 16\%. Approximately 85\% of the sediment delivered to the
   debris basins occurred during the first year, with first year sediment
   yields being greatest in the chaparral watersheds. Peak discharge was
   similar for both the grass and chaparral watersheds and was highest
   following the record rainfall of the 2005 hydrologic year. However, only
   minor sedimentation followed the record rain events and was similar in
   both watershed types, suggesting that percent plant cover was sufficient
   and that the supply of easily mobilized sediment and ravel was depleted
   after the first post-fire winter.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In order to maximize the resiliency of Pinus halepensis in
   semiarid forests, we analyzed direct seeding methods to recover burned
   stands by simulating post-fire soil treatments. Methods: Seeding was
   done by installing spot seeding (100 seeds in a 50 x 50 cmplot), using
   fivemethods: (1) covering seeding with wood chips; (2) seeding in branch
   piles; (3) seeding along trunks on contour-felled logs (on the shaded
   side); (4) seeding next to grass (Stipa tenacissima); and (5) seeding on
   the bare ground (control). The experiment was replicated according to
   aspect (northern and southern aspects). The response variables were seed
   germination (\%), and seedling survival after the summer (measured in
   autumn 2015 and 2016). Direct seeding was carried out in 32 plots with
   160-spot seeding, and data were analyzed using general linear models,
   including nested random effects. Results: Wood chips as a
   surface-covering material represented the only treatment that
   significantly improved seed germination and seedling survival (by
   12.4\%, and 17.4 seedlings m(-2) in year 2, respectively) compared with
   the control in the two topographic aspects. Conclusions: Covering
   seeding with wood chips, and thus chipping wood within the burned stand,
   form a recommended post-fire treatment to improve regeneration in Pinus
   halepensis semiarid stands.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires resulting from thunderstorms are common in some
   Mediterranean-climate regions, such as southern California, and have
   played an important role in the ecology and evolution of the flora.
   Mediterranean-climate regions are major centers for human population and
   thus anthropogenic impacts on fire regimes may have important
   consequences on these plant formations. However. changes in fire regimes
   may have different impacts on Mediterranean type-ecosystems depending on
   the capability of plants to respond to such perturbations. Therefore, we
   compare here fire regimes and vegetation responses of two
   Mediterranean-climate regions which differ in wildfire regimes and
   history of human occupation, the central zone of Chile (matorral) and
   the southern area of California in United States (chaparral). In Chile
   almost all fires result from anthropogenic activities, whereas lightning
   fires resulting from thunderstorms are frequent in California. In both
   regions fires are more frequent in summer, due to high accumulation of
   dry plant biomass for ignition. Humans have markedly increased fires
   frequency both in the matorral and chaparral, but extent of burned areas
   has remained unaltered, probably due to better fire suppression actions
   and a decline in the built-up of dry plant fuel associated to increased
   landscape fragmentation with less flammable agricultural and urban
   developments. As expected, post-fire plant regeneration responses
   differs between the matorral and chaparral due to differences in the
   importance of wild fires as a natural evolutionary force in the system.
   Plants from the chaparral show a broader range of post-fire regeneration
   responses than the matorral, from basal resprouting, to lignotuber
   resprouting, and to fire-stimulated germination and flowering with
   fire-specific clues such as heat shock, chemicals from smoke or charred
   wood. Plants from the matorral have some resprouting capabilities after
   fire, but these probably evolved from other environmental pressures,
   such as severe and long summer droughts. herbivory, and volcanism.
   Although both Mediterranean-type ecosystems have shown to be resilient
   to anthropogenic fires, increasing fire frequency may be an important
   factor that needs to be considered as it may result in strong negative
   effects on plant successional trends and on plant diversity.}},

   in Eastern Attica, Greece}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, forest fires have increased in terms of frequency,
   extent and intensity, especially in Mediterranean countries. Climate
   characteristics and anthropogenic disturbances lead forest environments
   to display high vulnerability to wildfires, with their sustainability
   being threatened by the loss of vegetation, changes on soil properties,
   and increased soil loss rates. Moreover, wildfires are a great threat to
   property and human life, especially in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)
   areas. In light of the impacts and trends mentioned above, this study
   aims to assess the impact of the Mati, Attika wildfire on soil erosion.
   The event caused 102 fatalities, inducing severe consequences to the
   local infrastructure network; economy; and natural resources. As such,
   the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was implemented (pre-;
   post-fire) at the Rafina, Attika watershed encompassing the Mali WUI.
   Fire severity was evaluated based on the Normalized Bum Ratio (NBR).
   This index was developed utilizing innovative remotely sensed Earth
   Observation data (Sentinel-2). The high post-fire values indicate the
   fire's devastating effects on vegetation loss and soil erosion. A
   critical ``update{''} was also made to the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) v.
   2018, by introducing a new land use class namely ``Urban Forest{''}, in
   order to distinguish the WUI configuration. Post-fire erosion rates are
   notably higher throughout the study area (4.53-5.98 t ha(-1) y(-1)), and
   especially within the WUI zone (3.75-18.58 t ha(-1) y(-1)), while newly
   developed and highly vulnerable cites now occupy the greater Mad area.
   Furthermore, archive satellite data (Landsat-5) revealed how the
   repeated (historical) wildfires have ultimately impacted vegetation
   recovery and erosional processes. To our knowledge this is the first
   time that RUSLE is used to simulate soil erosion at a WUI after a fire
   event, at least at a Mediterranean basin. The realistic results attest
   that the model can perform well at such diverse conditions, providing a
   solid basis for soil loss estimation and identification of high-risk
   erosion areas.}},

Abstract = {{The number of forest fires, their severity and recurrence, the surface
   burned and the duration of fire risk season have increased in the
   Mediterranean basin over the last few decades. These factors promoted an
   increase of naturally regenerated, unmanaged pine forests and as a
   consequence, the risk of new wildfires. Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis
   mill.) is an obligate seeder adapted to fire-prone habitats, and a very
   important timber species affected by this phenomenon. In eastern Spain
   alone more than 100 000 ha of Aleppo pine forests were burned in summer,
   1994. One of the forests (naturally regenerated) was selected in order
   to design an adequate post-fire management model.
   Several plots were set in two different sites of the fires considered.
   Silvicultural treatments were carried out at five and ten years after
   the fire. All trees in the selected plots were marked and monitored.
   Growth, reproductive characteristics and several allometric parameters
   were measured in the treated plots. Several measurements in burned (all
   treated and control plots) and unburned plots were recorded in order to
   obtain structural patterns and biodiversity indices,
   The plots thinned ten years after the fire and the unburned plots showed
   a regular, non-aggregated distribution pattern and low diameter
   differentiation. Also, these thinned plots showed biodiversity
   characteristics similar to mature stands. The increases and final values
   for growth and reproductive characteristics measured in the monitored
   plots were different for each site but thinning improved growth and the
   amount of seeds stored in the canopy, thus insuring a more successful
   regeneration should fire affect the same site again in the early life
   stages.
   The optimal management policy obtained improves growth and reproductive
   processes, shortens the juvenile phase, accelerates the mature age and
   increases the canopy seed bank. It reduces the immaturity risk and
   improves the post-fire resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Fire has an important role for regeneration of many boreal forest tree
   species, and this includes both wildfire and prescribed burning
   following clear-cutting. Depending on the severity, fire can have a
   variety of effects on above-and below-ground properties that impact tree
   seedling establishment. Very little is known about the impacts of ground
   fire severity on post-fire seedling performance, or how the effects of
   fire severity interact with those of canopy structure. We conducted a
   full-factorial experiment that manipulated surface-burn severity (no
   burn; light, medium, or heavy burn; or scarification) and canopy (closed
   forest or open clear-cut) to reveal their interactive effects on
   ecophysiological traits of establishing broadleaf and conifer seedlings
   in a Swedish boreal forest. Medium and heavy surface burns increased
   seedling growth, photosynthesis, respiration, and foliar N and P
   concentrations, and these effects were most apparent in open clear-cuts.
   Growth rates of all species responded similarly to surface-burn
   treatments, although photosynthesis, foliar P, and specific leaf area
   were more responsive to burning treatments for broadleaf species than
   for conifers. Our study demonstrates that the positive impacts of fire
   on tree seedling physiology are dependent on a minimum severity
   threshold and are more effective when combined with clear-cutting.}},

Abstract = {{Xanthorrhoea australis R.Br. is considered a fire-tolerant species, a
   statement evidently based on established adaptive traits rather than
   fire recorded studies. This two-year post-fire study of X. australis in
   areas that have been subjected to prescribed burning in 1976 and 1991
   compares results with a site unburnt for about 100 years. In the sites
   burnt in 1991, arborescent plants had a mortality of between 10\% and
   40\% (average 21\%), with highest mortality in the youngest and oldest
   plants, and in the site with the lowest plant density. In the site burnt
   in 1976, plants were still dying. Mortality of plants in the unburnt
   site was 4\%. Flowering in the first post-fire spring varied from
   0-100\% throughout the size classes, with no flowering observed in
   plants smaller than 0.5 m. In the unburnt sites and the 1976 burnt
   sites, where understorey protected seedlings, recruitment was
   significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in the areas burnt in 1991 that
   had little ground cover. Plants with severe burn damage to stems at
   ground level often developed leans (P < 0.001) that were more often
   opposite to the burnt side (P < 0.001). Leans increased from 2.5 degrees
   to 35 degrees, and some plants continued to grow, lying horizontally. In
   all fire sites the horizontal plants had a mortality of 44-92\% compared
   with 29\% for those in the unburnt site. In some sites, particularly in
   areas of high soil moisture, 3-10\% of plants developed epicormic shoots
   after their stems fractured, or their shoot apices died. The study
   showed that fire has a long-term deleterious effect on large plants of
   this species. These data should be taken into account by authorities
   engaged in prescribed burning in forests with significant stands of this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Native sagebrush ecosystems in the Great Basin (western USA) are often
   invaded following fire by exotic Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), a highly
   flammable annual grass. Once B. tectorum is established, higher fire
   frequencies can lead to local extirpation of Artemisia tridentata ssp.
   vaseyana (mountain big sagebrush) and have cascading effects on
   sagebrush ecosystems and the species that depend on them. We conducted a
   landscape-scale observational study to examine the distribution and
   cover of B. tectorum and A. tridentata 6 years after a large wildland
   fire. We used structural equation models to quantify the interacting
   influences of pre-fire tree canopy cover, perennial species cover,
   distance from potential seed source, and site environment on post-fire
   cover of B. tectorum and A. tridentata. Results confirmed a hypothesised
   negative effect of pre-fire tree canopy cover on post-fire cover of A.
   tridentata. Site-and landscape-level abiotic factors influenced pre-fire
   tree canopy cover, which, in turn, influenced the probability of rapid
   recovery to A. tridentata. However, B. tectorum cover was primarily
   influenced by a positive effect of incident solar radiation and a
   negative effect of perennial herbaceous species cover. Restoration
   efforts to reduce tree canopy cover should be limited to productive
   sites with sufficient cover of perennial herbaceous species to
   facilitate site recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Fire disturbance alters the structural complexity of forests,

   may also alter forest species composition, richness, and diversity. We
   compared changes in plant recruitment, mortality, and turnover time over
   three years between burned and unburned sites of two seasonally flooded
   natural forest patches in a predominantly savanna landscape (regionally
   called `impucas') in order to determine how fire alters forest dynamics
   and species composition. Within each impuca, 50 permanent plots (20 m x
   10 m) were established and all individuals >= 5 cm diameter at breast
   height (DBH) identified and measured in two censuses, the first in 2007
   and the second in 2010. Unplanned fires burned 30 plots in impuca 1 and
   35 in impuca 2 after the first census, which enabled thereafter the
   comparison between burned and unburned sites. The highest mortality (8.0
   and 24.3\% year(-1) for impuca 1 and 2) and turnover time (69 and 121.5
   years) were observed in the burned sites, compared to 3.7 and 5.2\%

   are embedded in a fire-adapted savanna landscape, the impucas vegetation
   appears to be sensitive to fire, with burned areas having higher
   mortality and turnover than unburned areas. This indicates that these
   forest islands are potentially at risk if regional fire frequency

Abstract = {{Post-fire vegetation cover is a crucial parameter in rangeland
   management. This study aims to assess the post-fire vegetation recovery
   3 years after the large 2007 Peloponnese (Greece) wildfires. Post-fire
   recovery landscapes typically are mixed vegetation-substrate
   environments which makes spectral mixture analysis (SMA) a very
   effective tool to derive fractional vegetation cover maps. Using a
   combination of field and simulation techniques this study aimed to
   account for the impact of background brightness variability on SMA model
   performance. The field data consisted out of a spectral library of in
   situ measured reflectance signals of vegetation and substrate and 78
   line transect plots. In addition, a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene
   was employed in the study. A simple SMA, in which each constituting
   terrain feature is represented by its mean spectral signature, a
   multiple endmember SMA (MESMA) and a segmented SMA, which accounts for
   soil brightness variations by forcing the substrate endmember choice
   based on ancillary data (lithological map), were applied. In the study
   area two main spectrally different lithological units were present:
   relatively bright limestone and relatively dark flysch (sand-siltstone).
   Although the simple SMA model resulted in reasonable regression fits for
   the flysch and limestones subsets separately (coefficient of
   determination R-2 of respectively 0.67 and 0.72 between field and TM
   data), the performance of the regression model on the pooled dataset was
   considerably weaker (R-2=0.65). Moreover, the regression lines
   significantly diverged among the different subsets leading to systematic
   over-or underestimations of the vegetative fraction depending on the
   substrate type. MESMA did not solve the endmember variability issue. The
   MESMA model did not manage to select the proper substrate spectrum on a
   reliable basis due to the lack of shape differences between the flysch
   and limestone spectra,. The segmented SMA model which accounts for soil
   brightness variations minimized the variability problems. Compared to
   the simple SMA and MESMA models, the segmented SMA resulted in a higher
   overall correlation (R-2 = 0.70), its regression slope and intercept
   were more similar among the different substrate types and its resulting
   regression lines more closely resembled the expected one-one line. This
   paper demonstrates the improvement of a segmented approach in accounting
   for soil brightness variations in estimating vegetative cover using SMA.
   However, further research is required to evaluate the model's
   performance for other soil types, with other image data and at different
   post-fire timings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Aleppo pines depends on climate and site conditions}},

Abstract = {{In fire- and drought-prone Mediterranean forests tree growth and
   regeneration depend on the moisture regime between fires. Therefore,
   post-fire tree regeneration will depend on moisture conditions and how
   they are altered by fire recurrence and climate warming. Aleppo pine
   forests are the most abundant Circum-Mediterranean ecosystems subjected
   to frequent wildfires and summer droughts. Because both stressors
   constrain their reproduction and growth patterns across diverse
   ecological conditions, these forests represent a suitable system to test
   how moisture availability drives post-fire regeneration. Aleppo pine is
   an obligate seeder species that reproduces at an early age after fire.
   Such precocious behaviour poses the question as to whether post-fire
   regeneration depends on moisture conditions and the coupling between
   female cone production and growth. Here, we evaluate if female cone
   production and radial growth are linked at the tree level in post-fire
   Aleppo pines by comparing a dry v. a very dry site and considering
   stands with three different tree densities in south-eastern Spain. We
   found that trees with higher basal areas produced more female cones and
   this positive association intensified as the water balance improved.
   Aleppo pines from the very dry site were more precocious in reproductive
   terms than pines of the same age from the dry site, but long-term cone
   production was lower at the very dry site. Lower tree density enhances
   the resilience of xeric post-fire Aleppo pine forests, in growth and
   reproduction terms, but this effect can be reversed by droughts.
   Overall, a more positive water balance improves post-fire regeneration
   by enhancing growth and cone production. Thus, silvicultural treatments
   such as thinning should be applied by taking into account the post-fire
   water balance to maximise growth and cone production in Aleppo pine
   stands. Our findings illustrate how climate warming could hamper
   post-fire tree regeneration by aggravating drought stress.}},

Abstract = {{The physiological responses of tree regeneration to fire were studied in
   openings in a mesic hardwood forest. Gas exchange, nitrogen

   and nonburned regeneration of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white
   ash (Fraxinus americana L.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.)
   following spring fires in 1989 and 1990. Fire led to a stimulation of
   light-saturated photosynthesis in foliage of resprouting plants, but the
   effect varied in magnitude among species. On average, photosynthesis of
   post-fire maple was 42\% higher than that on nonburned plots, with
   corresponding increases occurring in stomatal conductance and leaf N
   concentration, Ln general, fire had a marginal effect on leaf properties
   of oak and ash. In 1990, the ratio of root area to leaf area and the
   water potential of sunlit foliage were significantly higher on burned
   than nonburned plots for maple, but not for oak or ash, paralleling
   trends in photosynthesis. There was little evidence of a treatment
   difference in soil moisture or nitrogen availability, and it appeared
   that fire-induced stimulations in photosynthesis were mediated primarily
   by changes in intrinsic (e.g., root area/leaf area ratio) as opposed to
   extrinsic (e.g., soil moisture) factors governing resource availability
   to the canopy of post-fire sprouts.}},

Abstract = {{We examined spatial patterns of post-fire regenerating conifers in a

   post-fire regenerating conifers, as well as all other post-fire

   4-ha plots following the 2002 Hayman Fire. Residual tree density ranged
   from 167 to 197 trees ha(-1) (TPH), and these trees were clustered at
   distances up to 30 m. Post-fire regenerating conifers, which ranged in
   density from 241 to 1036 TPH, were also clustered at distances up to at
   least 30 m. Moreover, residual tree locations drove post-fire
   regenerating conifer locations, with the two showing a pattern of

   further drove post-fire conifer regeneration locations. These results

Abstract = {{The savanna formations of the Brazilian `'Cerrado'' present a high
   degree of resistance and resilience to the impacts of fire, although
   little is known of its forest formations. Given this, the present study
   evaluated the resistance and resilience of the `'Cerradao'' to fire
   impacts over a 7-year period. In March 2008, we established 50 permanent
   plots of 10 m X 10 m and measured all the woody individuals with a base
   diameter >= 5 cm. Six months later, all plots were burned by an
   accidental fire. In March 2012 and March 2015, we re-measured all
   surviving individuals, and measured the recruits. Species richness, the
   density of individuals, and the basal area were all significantly
   greater ( P < 0.05) in 2008, prior to the fire, in comparison with 2012
   and 2015, after the fire. Species richness and the density of
   individuals were also higher ( P < 0.05) in 2015, about 7 years
   post-fire, in comparison with 2012. During the interval in which the
   fire occurred ( 2008-2012), the mortality and reposition time, and the

   `'Cerradao'' has reduced resistance and resilience to the disturbances
   caused by fire relative to savanna formations. Given this, frequent
   burn-off may cause drastic alterations to this phytophysiognomy,
   emphasizing the need for special care for the preservation of its
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Fires have significant impacts on soil erosion and water supply that may
   be exacerbated by future climate. The aims of this study were: To
   simulate the effects of a large fire event in the SWAT (Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool) hydrological model previously calibrated to a
   medium-sized watershed in Portugal; and to predict the hydrological
   impacts of large fires and future climate on water supply and soil
   erosion. For this, post-fire recovery was parametrized in SWAT based on
   satellite information, namely, the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC)
   calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The
   impact of future climate was based on four regional climate models under
   the stabilization (RCP 4.5) and high emission (RCP 8.5) scenarios,
   focusing on mid-century projections (2020-2049) compared to a historical
   period (1970-1999). Future large fire events (>3000 ha) were predicted
   from a multiple linear regression model, which uses the daily severity
   rating (DSR) fire weather index, precipitation anomaly, and burnt area
   in the previous three years; and subsequently simulated in SWAT under
   each climate model/scenario. Results suggest that time series of
   satellite indices are useful to inform SWAT about vegetation growth and
   post-fire recovery processes. Different land cover types require
   different time periods for returning to the pre-fire fraction of
   vegetation cover, ranging from 3 years for pines, eucalypts, and shrubs,
   to 6 years for sparsely vegetated low scrub. Future climate conditions
   are expected to include an increase in temperatures and a decrease in
   precipitation with marked uneven seasonal distribution, and this will
   likely trigger the growth of burnt area and an increased frequency of
   large fires, even considering differences across climate models. The
   future seasonal pattern of precipitation will have a strong influence on
   river discharge, with less water in the river during spring, summer, and
   autumn, but more discharge in winter, the latter being exacerbated under
   the large fire scenario. Overall, the decrease in water supply is more
   influenced by climate change, whereas soil erosion increase is more
   dependent on fire, although with a slight increase under climate change.
   These results emphasize the need for adaptation measures that target the
   combined hydrological consequences of future climate, fires, and
   post-fire vegetation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is central to the ecology of Mediterranean-type climate ecosystems,
   but little is known about the fire ecology of succulent plants therein.
   This study investigated the fire ecology of an arborescent succulent
   monocot, Kumara plicatilis (L.) G. D. Rowley (Asphodelaceae), a Cape
   fynbos endemic. Habitat suitability was assessed to determine whether
   the species tolerates or avoids' fire, and fire survival traits (bark
   thickness and tissue water content) were measured. The population size
   structure and density of three K.plicatilis populations were assessed
   after natural fires, and resprouting potential was investigated. Kumara
   plicatilis adopts a dual fire survival strategy, occupying rocky sites
   to avoid' fire and possessing morphological features that afford fire
   tolerance, e.g. well-protected apical meristems and thick corky bark.
   Bark thickness of burned individuals in situ was similar to unburned
   plants, suggesting that K.plicatilis bark provides effective insulation
   against fire. Mortality rates were 64\%, 40\% and 11\%, and decreased as
   rock cover at the population level increased. All three populations
   showed reduced plant density post-fire, with greater density reductions
   associated with lower rock cover. Small plants appear most vulnerable to
   fire damage due to lower absolute bark thickness and plant heights
   within the flame zone. Kumara plicatilis is an apical sprouter,
   recovering after fire or mechanical stem damage by onward growth from
   surviving stem apices, rather than resprouting. Post-fire population
   recovery therefore likely depends on inter-fire recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Can prescribed fire restore C-4 perennial grasses in
   grassland ecosystems that have become dominated by fire-resistant C-3
   shrubs (Prosopis glandulosa) and C-3 grasses? Do fires in different
   seasons alter the direction of change in grass composition?
   Location: Texas, USA.
   Methods: We quantified short-and long-term (12 yr post-fire) herbaceous
   functional group cover and diversity responses to replicated seasonal
   fire treatments: (1) repeated-winter fires (three in 5 yr), (2)
   repeated-summer fires (two in 3 yr), and (3) alternate-season fires (two
   winter and one summer in 4 yr), compared with a no-fire control.
   Results: Summer fires were more intense than winter fires, but all fire
   treatments temporarily decreased Prosopis and C-3 annual grass cover.
   The alternate-season fire treatment caused a long-term increase in C-4
   mid-grass cover and functional group diversity. The repeated-summer fire
   treatment increased C-4 short-grass cover but also caused a long-term
   increase in bare ground. The repeated winter fire treatment had no
   long-term effects on perennial grass cover. Mesquite post-fire regrowth
   had increasingly negative impacts on herbaceous cover in all fire
   treatments.
   Conclusions: Summer fire was necessary to shift herbaceous composition
   toward C-4 mid-grasses. However, the repeated-summer fire treatment may
   have been too extreme and caused post-fire herbaceous composition to
   ``over-shift{''} toward less productive C-4 short-grasses rather than
   C-4 mid-grasses. This study provides some of the first long-term data
   showing a possible benefit of mixing seasonal fires (i.e., the
   alternate-season fire treatment) in a prescribed burning management plan
   to restore C-4 mid-grass cover and enhance overall herbaceous diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the resilience of plant-animal interactions is critical to
   understanding how plant communities respond to habitat disturbances.
   Most ecosystems experience some level of natural disturbance (e.g.
   wildfires) to which many organisms are adapted. Wildfires have
   structured biotic communities for millennia; however, the effects of
   fire on interactions such as pollination have only recently received
   attention. A few studies have shown that generalist plants can buffer
   the impact of fires by pollinator replacement, suggesting that the
   resilience to disturbance could depend on the level of specialization of
   the interactions. Here, we hypothesize that (1) fires could impose
   negative effects on plants with specialized pollination systems, and (2)
   in large wildfires, these negative effects will be stronger with
   increasing distance inside the burnt area because pollinators will need
   more time to recolonize.
   These questions were tested in the specialized pollination system of a
   widespread Mediterranean palm, Chamaerops humilis. The post-fire
   pollination resilience was assessed in replicated wildfires representing
   three post-fire ages by measuring the abundance of beetle pollinators
   and by estimating fruit set (i.e. the proportion of flowers setting
   fruits) in burnt and unburnt areas. To test for distance effects, plants
   were sampled along transects inside the burnt area.
   Despite a marked post-fire decline in the specialist pollinator,
   exacerbated by the distance from the fire's edge, the palm's fruit set
   was barely affected. The temporary replacement by a sap beetle at burnt
   sites - an effective pollinator that had not been previously recognized
   - provided post-fire reproductive resilience.
   Differential pollinator responses to disturbance can ensure plant
   success even in plants with only two functionally similar pollinators.
   This highlights the importance of pollinator replacement and dynamics
   for the resilience of interactions and ultimately of plant reproduction
   in disturbance-prone ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a dynamic ecological process in forests and impacts the carbon
   (C) cycle through direct combustion emissions, tree mortality, and by
   impairing the ability of surviving trees to sequester carbon. While
   studies on young trees have demonstrated that fire intensity is a
   determinant of post-fire net primary productivity, wildland fires on
   landscape to regional scales have largely been assumed to either cause
   tree mortality, or conversely, cause no physiological impact, ignoring
   the impacted but surviving trees. Our objective was to understand how
   fire intensity affects post-fire net primary productivity in
   conifer-dominated forested ecosystems on the spatial scale of large
   wildland fires. We examined the relationships between fire radiative
   power (FRP), its temporal integral (fire radiative energy - FRE), and
   net primary productivity (NPP) using 16 years of data from the MOderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) for 15 large fires in western
   United States coniferous forests. The greatest NPP post-fire loss
   occurred 1 year post-fire and ranged from -67 to -312 gCm(-2) yr(-1)
   (-13 to -54 \%) across all fires. Forests dominated by fire-resistant
   species (species that typically survive low-intensity fires) experienced
   the lowest relative NPP reductions compared to forests with less
   resistant species. Post-fire NPP in forests that were dominated by
   fire-susceptible species were not as sensitive to FRP or FRE, indicating
   that NPP in these forests may be reduced to similar levels regardless of
   fire intensity. Conversely, post-fire NPP in forests dominated by
   fire-resistant and mixed species decreased with increasing FRP or FRE.
   In some cases, this dose-response relationship persisted for more than a
   decade post-fire, highlighting a legacy effect of fire intensity on
   post-fire C dynamics in these forests.}},

Abstract = {{Plant communities are sensitive to perturbations and may display
   alternative recovery pathways depending on disturbance history. In
   sub-boreal lodgepole pine forests of central interior British Columbia,
   Canada, fire and logging are two widespread landscape disturbances that
   overlap in many regions. We asked whether cumulative, short-interval
   disturbance from logging and fire resulted in different ground-layer
   plant communities than resulted from fire alone. Using field-collected
   data, we compared the taxonomic composition and functional traits of
   3-year old plant communities that were either harvested 6-to-13 years
   prior, or not harvested prior to being burned in a large stand-replacing
   fire. The taxonomic composition diverged between the two treatments,
   driven primarily by differences in a few key indicator species such as
   Petasites frigidus and Vaccinium membranaceum. Analysis of individual
   species' morphological traits indicated that only a few species vary in
   size in relation to disturbance history. Our data suggest that a history
   of forest harvest leaves a subtle footprint on post-fire ground-layer
   plant communities at early stages of succession.}},

Abstract = {{High severity wildfires pose threats to human assets, but are also
   perceived to impact vegetation communities because a small number of
   species may become dominant immediately after fire. However there are
   considerable gaps in our knowledge about species-specific responses of
   plants to different fire severities, and how this influences fuel hazard
   in the short and long-term. Here we conduct a floristic survey at sites
   before and two years after a wildfire of unprecedented size and severity
   in the Warrumbungle National Park (Australia) to explore relationships
   between post-fire growth of a fire responsive shrub genera (Acacia),
   total mid-story vegetation cover, fire severity and fuel hazard. We then
   survey 129 plots surrounding the park to assess relationships between
   mid-story vegetation cover and time-since-fire. Acacia species richness
   and cover were 2.3 and 4.3 times greater at plots after than before the
   fire. However the same common dominant species were present throughout
   the study. Mid-story vegetation cover was 1.5 times greater after than
   before the wildfire, and Acacia species contribution to mid-story cover
   increased from 10 to 40\%. Acacia species richness was not affected by
   fire severity, however strong positive associations were observed
   between Acacia and total mid-story vegetation cover and severity. Our
   analysis of mid-story vegetation recovery showed that cover was
   similarly high between 2 and 30 years post-fire, then decreased until 52
   years. Collectively, our results suggest that Acacia species are
   extremely resilient to high severity wildfire and drive short to
   mid-term increases in fuel hazard. Our results are discussed in relation
   to fire regime management from the twin perspectives of conserving
   biodiversity and mitigating human losses due to wildfire. (C) 2016

   Mosaics of differing stand ages generated by fire could therefore be
   most effective in supplying a suite of subsistence species to

Abstract = {{Many ecosystems experience drastic changes to soil nutrient availability
   associated with fire, but the magnitude and duration of these changes
   are highly variable among vegetation and fire types. In pyrogenic pine
   savannas across the southeastern United States, pulses of soil inorganic
   nitrogen (N) occur in tandem with ecosystem-scale nutrient losses from
   prescribed burns. Despite the importance of this management tool for
   restoring and maintaining fire-dependent plant communities, the
   contributions of different mechanisms underlying fire-associated changes
   to soil N availability remain unclear. Pulses of N availability
   following fire have been hypothesized to occur through (1) changes to
   microbial cycling rates and (2) direct ash deposition. Here, we document
   fire-associated changes to N availability across the growing season in a
   longleaf pine savanna in North Carolina. To differentiate between
   possible mechanisms driving soil N pulses, we measured net microbial
   cycling rates and changes to soil delta N-15 before and after a burn.
   Our findings refute both proposed mechanisms: we found no evidence for
   changes in microbial activity, and limited evidence that ash deposition
   could account for the increase in ammonium availability to more than
   5-25 times background levels. Consequently, we propose a third mechanism
   to explain post-fire patterns of soil N availability, namely that (3)
   changes to plant sink strength may contribute to ephemeral increases in
   soil N availability, and encourage future studies to explicitly test
   this mechanism.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{473}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Understanding of post-fire residual vegetation patterns is important
   when shoreline vegetation management aims to emulate natural disturbance
   (END) patterns. To assess the impacts of fire, lake and lakeshed sizes
   on the burning pattern of shorelines and lakesheds, we quantified the
   burned shorelines and post-fire residual vegetation patterns in the
   lakesheds of 123 lakes of Ontario affected by 26 wildfires between 2005
   and 2007. We used ArcGIS and Ontario's Enhanced Forest Resources
   Inventory (eFRI) GIS data to digitize burn patterns. The lake catchments
   for all lakes were delineated using ArcGIS via lake, river, and
   elevation data from the Integrated Hydrology geodatabase (MNRF, 2016).
   The shorelines of fire impacted lakes were generated from the eFRI
   polygon feature classes, and the polylines were then split according to
   the digitized burn pattern polygons by running a geometric intersection
   with these data. The results of this study show that the percentages of
   burned shorelines and lakesheds are positively correlated with the size
   of fire and negatively correlated with the sizes of lake and lakeshed.
   However, irrespective of the size of fire, lake or lakeshed, shorelines
   are not left completely unburned, which is contrary to existing practice
   of retaining fixed-width shoreline buffers. It may imply that under END
   based management, forest harvesting can be possible up to the shorelines
   in some areas of the landscapes that are left unharvested under a
   fixed-width riparian buffer management system. However, areas of strong
   hydrological connectivity between land and water serve as biogeochemical
   control points and require protection from disturbance during forest
   management planning and operations. We suggest that GIS-based models
   developed based on the hydrological and topographical features
   associated with the unburned shorelines and lakesheds might be useful to
   predict shoreline residual forest pattern and facilitate END based
   shoreline forest management.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeochemical and stoichiometric signature of vegetation fire may

   higherconcentrations of soil mineral P as well as significantly lower
   soil and litter carbon:P and nitrogen:P ratios. These results
   demonstrate that fire has a P-rich signature in the soil-plant system
   that varies with vegetation type. Further, they suggest that burning can
   ease P limitation and decouple the biogeochemical cycling of P, carbon
   and nitrogen. These effects resemble a transient reversion to an earlier
   stage of ecosystem development, and likely underpin at least some of
   fire's impacts on ecosystems and organisms.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are expected to increase as a result of climate change. In
   order to effectively manage and monitor climate-induced changes in
   Canadian forests, a national-scale understanding of factors influencing
   wildfire susceptibility is necessary. The goal of this study is to
   better understand factors influencing large area wildfire susceptibility
   in Canada. Using year 2000 Canadian land cover data, we identify
   locations that burned before and after 2000. Pre- and post-fire
   landscape patterns were assessed and regression tree analyses were used
   to identify factors influencing national-scale fire susceptibility. Land
   cover composition, forest pattern, elevation, and anthropogenic
   influences were quantified for both pre- and post-fire environments. We
   examined recovery of forest pattern following wildfire events and
   derived a large-area fire susceptibility model using decision tree
   classification. Our results indicate that 11.88\% of forested ecozones
   were impacted by large fires. The majority of large wildfires occur in
   coniferous forests characterized by high forest cover (greater than
   45\%), few forest patches, large mean forest patch area, and
   fragmentation-limited forest. Forests occurring at low to intermediate
   distances from populated places (50-150 km) and roads (12-72 km)
   experienced unexpectedly high amounts of fire, as did lower elevation
   forests. After fire, percentage forest cover, number of forest patches,
   forest patch size, and proportion forest patches regenerated to pre-fire
   forest pattern conditions within approximately 20 years. Anthropogenic
   influences on wildfire susceptibility indicate that human activity still
   dictates national fire regimes. Additionally, knowledge of space-time
   patterns of fire-landscape interaction and landscape pattern
   regeneration provides useful baselines for future comparisons with
   responses to climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increased fire activity within boreal forests could affect global

   recruitment, leading to patterns of forest regrowth that differ from

   accumulation patterns within boreal forests, we evaluated above- and
   belowground C pools within 17 Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi) stands of
   northeastern Siberia that varied in both years since fire and stand
   density. Early-successional stands (< 20-year old) exhibited low larch
   recruitment, and consequently, low density, aboveground larch biomass,
   and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP(tree)). Mid-successional
   stands (21- to 70-year old) were even-aged with considerable variability
   in stand density. High-density mid-successional stands had 21 times
   faster rates of ANPP(tree) than low-density stands (252 vs. 12 g C m(-2)
   y(-1)) and 26 times more C in aboveground larch biomass (2,186 vs. 85 g
   C m(-2)). Density had little effect on total soil C pools. During
   late-succession (> 70-year old), aboveground larch biomass, ANPP(tree),
   and soil organic layer C pools increased with stand age. These stands
   were low density and multi-aged, containing both mature trees and new
   recruits. The rapid accumulation of aboveground larch biomass in
   high-density, mid-successional stands allowed them to obtain C stocks
   similar to those in much older low-density stands (similar to 8,000 g C
   m(-2)). If fire frequency increases without altering stand density,
   landscape-level C storage could decline, but if larch density also
   increases, large aboveground C pools within high-density stands could
   compensate for a shorter successional cycle.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Human-caused forest transitions are documented worldwide, especially
   during periods when land use by dense agriculturally-based populations
   intensified. However, the rate at which prehistoric human activities led
   to permanent deforestation is poorly resolved. In the South Island, New
   Zealand, the arrival of Polynesians c. 750 years ago resulted in
   dramatic forest loss and conversion of nearly half of native forests to
   open vegetation. This transformation, termed the Initial Burning Period,
   is documented in pollen and charcoal records, but its speed has been
   poorly constrained. High-resolution chronologies developed with a series
   of AMS radiocarbon dates from two lake sediment cores suggest the shift
   from forest to shrubland occurred within decades rather than centuries
   at drier sites. We examine two sites representing extreme examples of
   the magnitude of human impacts: a drier site that was inherently more
   vulnerable to human-set fires and a wetter, less burnable site. The
   astonishing rate of deforestation at the hands of small transient
   populations resulted from the intrinsic vulnerability of the native
   flora to fire and from positive feedbacks in post-fire vegetation
   recovery that increased landscape flammability. Spatially targeting
   burning in highly-flammable seral vegetation in forests rarely
   experiencing fire was sufficient to create an alternate fire-prone
   stable state. The New Zealand example illustrates how seemingly stable
   forest ecosystems can experience rapid and permanent conversions. Forest
   loss in New Zealand is among the fastest ecological transitions
   documented in the Holocene; yet equally rapid transitions can be
   expected in present-day regions wherever positive feedbacks support
   alternate fire-inhibiting, fire-prone stable states.}},

   vegetation recovery dynamics.
   This study aims to extract the main types of natural recovery
   trajectories from a Large Forest Fire occurred in 1994 from a
   thermophilous pine forests (Pinus Halepensis and Pinus Pinaster) in the
   long-term (1994-2018). We built annual composites from Landsat Surface
   Reflectance images and calculated Tasseled-cap components, which are
   sensitive to canopy moisture and structure (Wetness - TCW) and percent
   vegetation cover (Angle - TCA). We evaluated fire severity and fire
   recovery relationship. The differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) was
   used as a fire severity proxy, whereas recovery processes were assessed
   from spectral profiles using LandTrendr temporal segmentation algorithm.
   TCW and TCA were used as inputs to LandTrendr and the outputs of fitting
   were subsequently used to classify recovery types based on a k-means
   classification with the optimum number of clusters based on the Elbow
   Method. Groups of continuous positive recovery, non-continuous recovery
   and continuous recovery with slope changes were identified. The proposed
   method could be an approach to model the long-term recovery for the
   Mediterranean areas and help decisionmakers in determining which areas
   could not recover naturally.}},

Title = {{Patterns of canopy and surface layer consumption in a boreal forest fire
   from repeat airborne lidar}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fire in the boreal region is the dominant agent of forest disturbance
   with direct impacts on ecosystem structure, carbon cycling, and global
   climate. Global and biome-scale impacts are mediated by burn severity,
   measured as loss of forest canopy and consumption of the soil organic
   layer. To date, knowledge of the spatial variability in burn severity
   has been limited by sparse field sampling and moderate resolution
   satellite data. Here, we used pre- and post-fire airborne lidar data to
   directly estimate changes in canopy vertical structure and surface
   elevation for a 2005 boreal forest fire on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. We
   found that both canopy and surface losses were strongly linked to
   pre-fire species composition and exhibited important fine-scale spatial
   variability at sub-30m resolution. The fractional reduction in canopy
   volume ranged from 0.61 in lowland black spruce stands to 0.27 in mixed
   white spruce and broadleaf forest. Residual structure largely reflects
   standing dead trees, highlighting the influence of pre-fire forest
   structure on delayed carbon losses from aboveground biomass, post-fire
   albedo, and variability in understory light environments. Median loss of
   surface elevation was highest in lowland black spruce stands (0.18 m)
   but much lower in mixed stands (0.02 m), consistent with differences in
   pre-fire organic layer accumulation. Spatially continuous depth-of-burn
   estimates from repeat lidar measurements provide novel information to
   constrain carbon emissions from the surface organic layer and may inform
   related research on post-fire successional trajectories. Spectral
   measures of burn severity from Landsat were correlated with canopy (r =
   0.76) and surface (r = -0.71) removal in black spruce stands but
   captured less of the spatial variability in fire effects for mixed
   stands (canopy r = 0.56, surface r = -0.26), underscoring the difficulty
   in capturing fire effects in heterogeneous boreal forest landscapes
   using proxy measures of burn severity from Landsat.}},

Abstract = {{Savanna tree cover is dynamic due to disturbances such as fire and
   herbivory. Frequent fires can limit a key demographic transition from
   sapling to adult height classes in savanna trees. Saplings may be caught
   in a fire trap', wherein individuals repeatedly resprout following fire
   top-kill events. Saplings only rarely escape the cycle by attaining a
   fire-resistant height (e.g. taller than the minimum scorch height)
   during fire-free intervals.
   Large mammalian herbivores also may trap trees in shorter size classes.
   Browsing herbivores directly limit sapling height, while grazing
   herbivores such as cattle facilitate sapling growth indirectly via grass
   removal. Experimental studies investigating how meso-wildlife,
   megaherbivores and domestic livestock affect height of resprouts
   following fire are rare, but necessary for fully understanding how
   herbivory may reinforce (or counteract) the fire trap. In our study
   system, interactive fire-herbivore effects on transitions from sapling
   (<1m) to adult tree (>1m) height classes may be further influenced by
   plant defences, such as symbiotic ants.
   We used the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) to investigate
   how post-fire resprout size of a widespread monodominant East African
   tree, Acacia drepanolobium was influenced by (a) herbivory by different
   combinations of cattle, meso-wildlife (15-1,000kg) and megaherbivores
   (>1,000kg) and (b) the presence of acacia-ant mutualists that confer
   tree defences. We sampled height, stem length and ant occupancy of
   resprouts exposed to different herbivore combinations before and after
   controlled burns.
   Resprout height of saplings that were short prior to fire (<1m) was
   reduced primarily by meso-wildlife. Negative effects of elephants on
   post-fire resprout height increased with pre-fire tree size, suggesting
   that resprouts of the tallest trees (with the greatest potential to
   escape the fire trap cycle) were preferentially browsed and reduced in
   height by elephants. There were no significant cattle effects.Synthesis.
   We provide experimental evidence for two potential pathways through
   which large herbivores exert control over sapling escape from the fire
   trap: (a) post-fire meso-wildlife browsing of short (<1m) resprouts and
   (b) elephant browsing of the largest size class of resprouts, which
   would otherwise be most likely to escape the fire trap.}},

Abstract = {{The cessation of coppicing and grazing in Quercus woodlands, with its
   subsequent changes in the structure, composition and functioning of
   vegetation communities, is becoming more frequent throughout the
   Mediterranean Basin. In southern France, we have studied successional
   changes in Quercus pubescens woodlands by visiting previously studied
   sites 18 yr later. Changes in vertical structure, species richness,
   floristic composition, life form and dispersal type were analysed and
   compared between woodlands that had previously been grazed or ungrazed.
   Both successions showed a decline in vegetation cover in the 0-25 cm
   height class and in the height class immediately under the canopy layer,
   due to oak litter accumulation and tree ageing. In post-grazing
   succession, the abandonment of grazing and associated burning has
   allowed the vegetation cover to increase in the 0.25-2 m height class.
   In both successions, grassland species decreased in frequency and forest
   species increased, a trend which was stronger in undisturbed succession.
   Species richness decreased with time in the undisturbed succession, but
   remained stable in the post-grazing succession mainly because of the
   slow decline of plants linked to grazing. In undisturbed succession,
   therophytes and hemicryptophytes decreased. In contrast, therophytes and
   hemicryptophytes remained stable in post-grazing succession. In both
   successions, endozoochorous species (notably Ruscus aculeatus)
   increased. Plants dispersed by non-animal vectors decreased in
   undisturbed succession, but stability was observed in most of the
   dispersal types in post-grazing succession. These results showed that a
   time-lag existed between undisturbed succession and post-grazing
   succession, the latter remaining at a younger stage of successional
   development due to more recent impact of grazing. However, both
   successions have converged suggesting that most of the traces of grazing
   on vegetation will disappear within a few years. The vegetation of these
   coppices, regardless of the previous grazing regime, will become
   increasingly similar to the vegetation of undisturbed woodlands.
   However, their floristic composition will probably never be identical to
   that of undisturbed woodlands, mainly because of the rarity of these
   undisturbed woodlands and of the short-distance dispersal of many forest
   plant species.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{597-608}},
Abstract = {{Few temporal studies document vegetation change in Australian temperate
   grassy woodlands. Floristic and structural data were collected from 68
   randomly located sites in the Queens Domain, an urban grassy woodland
   remnant, in 1974, 1984, 1994 and 2000 and a search made for rare
   species. Species of conservation significance were concentrated at
   highly disturbed sites, whereas vegetation types of conservation
   significance decreased in area as a result of increases in the numbers
   of Allocasuarina verticillata, which caused a change in many unmown
   areas from Eucalyptus viminalis grassy woodland to E. viminalis - A.
   verticillata woodland/ forest or A. verticillata open/ closed forest.
   Structural changes were associated with changes in species composition
   and an increase in native- species richness. Increases in tree cover
   occurred where fires were most frequent, possibly as a result of the
   lack of mammalian herbivores. The frequencies of herbs and annual
   grasses were strongly affected by precipitation in the month of
   sampling. Half of the species that showed a consistent rise or fall
   through time were woody plants, approximately twice the number expected.
   In the dataset as a whole, species- richness variables were largely
   explained by varying combinations of variables related to moisture
   availability, altitude and the incidence of mowing. The strongest
   influences on species composition were the same, although slope and time
   since the last. re also contributed to multiple regression and
   generalised linear models. Compositional stability was positively
   related to native- species richness, whereas high levels of exotic-
   species richness occurred at both low and high levels of native- species
   richness. The maintenance of native- plant biodiversity on the Domain
   requires such counterintuitive measures as the maintenance of exotic
   trees and the control of native trees, demonstrating the contingencies
   of conservation management in fragmented vegetation that consists of a
   mixture of native and exotic species.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of soil burn
   severity and initial tree composition on long-term forest floor dynamics
   and ecosystem biomass partitioning within the Picea mariana {[}Mill.]
   BSP-feathermoss bioclimatic domain of northwestern Quebec. Changes in
   forest floor organic matter and ecosystem biomass partitioning were
   evaluated along a 2,355-year chronosequence of extant stands.
   Dendroecological and paleoecological methods were used to determine the
   time since the last fire, the soil burn severity of the last fire (high
   vs. low severity), and the post-fire tree composition of each stand (P.
   mariana vs. Pinus banksiana Lamb). In this paper, soil burn severity
   refers to the thickness of the organic matter layer accumulated above
   the mineral soil that was not burned by the last fire. In stands
   originating from high severity fires, the post-fire dominance by Pinus
   banksiana or P. mariana had little effect on the change in forest floor
   thickness and tree biomass. In contrast, stands established after low
   severity fires accumulated during the first century after fire 73\%
   thicker forest floors and produced 50\% less tree biomass than stands
   established after high severity fires. Standing tree biomass increased
   until approximately 100 years after high severity fires, and then
   decreased at a logarithmic rate in the millennial absence of fire.
   Forest floor thickness also showed a rapid initial accumulation rate,
   and continued to increase in the millennial absence of fire at a much
   slower rate. However, because forest floor density increased through
   time, the overall rate of increase in forest floor biomass (58 g m(-2)
   y(-1)) remained constant for numerous centuries after fire (700 years).
   Although young stands (< 200 years) have more than 60\% of ecosystem
   biomass locked-up in living biomass, older stands (> 200 years)
   sequester the majority (> 80\%) of it in their forest floor. The results
   from this study illustrate that, under similar edaphic conditions, a
   single gradient related to time since disturbance is insufficient to
   account for the full spectrum of ecosystem biomass dynamics occurring in
   eastern boreal forests and highlights the importance of considering soil
   burn severity. Although fire severity induces diverging ecosystem
   biomass dynamics in the short term, the extended absence of fire brings
   about a convergence in terms of ecosystem biomass accumulation and
   partitioning.}},

Abstract = {{Large mammals play significant roles in shaping the trophic structure of
   terrestrial ecosystems and affect the form of vegetation growth in many
   habitats. We studied large mammal community in a Mediterranean habitat
   mosaic generated by fires originally dominated by pine forests. We
   conducted camera-trapping surveys in three study sites with different
   fire histories, and we recorded eight large mammal species including
   brown bear (Ursus arctos), caracal (Caracal caracal), and wild goat
   (Capra aegagrus), which are of conservation importance. The mammal
   community found in the study sites was functionally diverse, including
   herbivores, omnivores, carnivores, seed dispersers, soil diggers, main
   preys, and top predators. The site burned 13 years ago had higher
   species richness than can be expected from a random pattern, but this
   was not the case in 30- and >40-year-old sites, showing the importance
   of relatively younger sites for large mammals. Eurasian badger had more
   probability to have more abundance in places with more open vegetation
   while wild goat had higher abundance in more dense vegetation. Young
   individuals of wild goat, brown bear, and wild boar were also detected
   in the study sites. The results indicate that burned habitats harbor a
   phylogenetically and functionally diverse large mammal community in
   landscapes originally dominated by Mediterranean pine forests.
   Therefore, these forests continue to retain importance for the large
   mammals after the fire, and burned habitats should be taken into
   consideration for the conservation and management plans together with
   mature forests in Mediterranean ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Timely hazard assessments are needed to assess post-fire debris flows

   This model is further calibrated to identify the geographic extent for
   applying post-fire hazard assessment models. Aerial photographs were
   used to map locations of post-fire debris-flow erosion and deposition in
   the San Gabriel Mountains. Terrain, burn severity, and soil
   characteristics expected to influence debris-flow erosion and deposition
   were calculated for each mapped location using 10-m resolution DEMs, GIS

   was used to develop a model that predicts the probability of erosion as
   a function of channel slope, planform curvature, and the length of the
   longest upstream flow path. The model was validated using an independent
   database of mapped locations of debris-flow erosion and deposition and
   found to make accurate and precise predictions. The model was further
   calibrated by identifying the average percentage of the drainage network

Abstract = {{Tapia woodland vegetation is a remnant of Madagascar sclerophyllous
   forest that has developed under the selective pressure of fire and is

   named tapia. We carried out a 2-year study in tapia woodland at Ibity
   mountain, a new protected area in central highlands of Madagascar. We
   aimed to describe the reproductive phenology of this vegetation type and
   to determine whether it is affected by fire. We addressed two main
   questions; 1) does fire frequency affect the proportion of reproducing
   individuals and the intensity of each flowering and fruiting event?; and
   2) does fire frequency influence the reproductive synchrony of species
   across the landscape? Thirteen woody species (373 individuals) were
   sampled at six sites selected across the Ibity mountain, where three
   that were burned three times between 2000 and 2010 and three burned just
   once during the decade. We found that (1) fire reduced the percentage of
   individuals that participate in each phenophase, and flower and fruit
   production was lower at the more frequently burned sites; and (2)
   increased fire frequency reduced the reproductive synchronization of
   species throughout the landscape. Fire is recognized as one of the major
   disturbances affecting mortality and recruitment of trees in tapia
   woodland. Our study indicates that fire also impacts the timing of plant
   reproduction at community and landscape levels. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published

   was no evidence of mortality due to the fire. Most eucalypts were
   topkilled (55 \%) but less frequently at low (39 \%) compared to
   moderate (55 \%) or high (74 \%) fire severity. Larger trees were less
   likely to suffer topkill. Taken together these results indicate that
   this wildfire has caused major changes to vegetation structure within
   the area burnt. Death of Callitris trees reduced canopy tree density by
   25 \% and a high proportion of eucalypt topkill has resulted in a
   shorter, more open forest. Recovery of the tallest structural components
   through eucalypt regrowth and maturation of Callitris may require
   fire-free intervals of several decades. Any fires within this period may
   extend the recovery time and lead to declines in populations of the
   obligate-seeding Callitris species.}},

Abstract = {{Xing'an larch, a deciduous coniferous species, is the zonal tree of the
   Greater Xing'an Mountains in Northeast China. In May 1987, a
   catastrophic fire broke out in the mountains and burned 1.3 million
   hectares of forests in 26 days. While studies have shown that forest
   greenness has come back to normal in certain years, the re-composition
   of this zonal species has not been studied after the 1987 fire. With a
   series of Landsat 8 OLI images acquired in 2013-2015, this study builds
   the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Vegetation
   Index (GVI) time series in a complete growing cycle. A decision tree is
   developed to classify tree species with an overall accuracy of 86.16\%
   and Kappa coefficient of 0.80. The re-composition of Xing'an larch after
   the 1987 fire is extracted, and its variations in areas under different
   fire intensities are statistically analyzed. Results show that Xing'an
   larch comprises 17.52\%, 26.20\% and 33.19\% of forests in burned areas
   with high, medium and low fire intensities, respectively. Even around 30
   years after the 1987 fire, the composition of this zonal species in
   boreal forest has not been fully recovered in the Greater Xing'an
   Mountains. The Xing'an larch map extracted in this study could serve as
   base information for ecological and environmental studies in this south

Title = {{Cork Oak Vulnerability to Fire: The Role of Bark Harvesting, Tree
   Characteristics and Abiotic Factors}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Forest ecosystems where periodical tree bark harvesting is a major
   economic activity may be particularly vulnerable to disturbances such as
   fire, since debarking usually reduces tree vigour and protection against
   external agents. In this paper we asked how cork oak Quercus suber trees
   respond after wildfires and, in particular, how bark harvesting affects
   post-fire tree survival and resprouting. We gathered data from 22
   wildfires ( 4585 trees) that occurred in three southern European
   countries (Portugal, Spain and France), covering a wide range of
   conditions characteristic of Q. suber ecosystems. Post-fire tree
   responses (tree mortality, stem mortality and crown resprouting) were
   examined in relation to management and ecological factors using
   generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results showed that bark
   thickness and bark harvesting are major factors affecting resistance of
   Q. suber to fire. Fire vulnerability was higher for trees with thin bark
   (young or recently debarked individuals) and decreased with increasing
   bark thickness until cork was 3-4 cm thick. This bark thickness
   corresponds to the moment when exploited trees are debarked again,
   meaning that exploited trees are vulnerable to fire during a longer
   period. Exploited trees were also more likely to be top-killed than
   unexploited trees, even for the same bark thickness. Additionally,
   vulnerability to fire increased with burn severity and with tree
   diameter, and was higher in trees burned in early summer or located in
   drier south-facing aspects. We provided tree response models useful to
   help estimating the impact of fire and to support management decisions.
   The results suggested that an appropriate management of surface fuels
   and changes in the bark harvesting regime (e. g. debarking coexisting
   trees in different years or increasing the harvesting cycle) would
   decrease vulnerability to fire and contribute to the conservation of
   cork oak ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Fire plays a major role in fire-dependent ecosystems in shaping plant
   traits, community assemblage, and in maintaining biodiversity and
   sustaining ecosystems. Excluding fire from fire-dependent ecosystems can
   substantially alter these ecosystems. This study mainly investigates the
   how the zonal vegetation evergreen broad-leaved forests as well as
   widely distributed vegetation Pinus yunnanensis forest and shrubland in
   the Central Yunnan Plateau adapt to fire, and addresses the role of fire
   in the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem to determine whether this
   ecosystem is fire-dependent. Re-sprouting trees and shrubs composed
   about 90.6\% of the dominant taxa. In re-sprouting species, 41 species
   (77.4\% of all re-sprouting species) were observed re-sprout from
   underground basal burls after a fire. After a fire, 100\% of all trees
   and tall shrubs, 93.6\% of all shrubs and 73.9\% of all herbs recovered.
   Two serotinous tree taxa were found, including two varieties of P.
   yunnanensis (var. pygmaea and var. yunnanensis) which is a dominant and
   the most common tree species in this region. All these were identified
   here as weakly serotinous species. The degree of serotiny was 50.4\% for
   P. yunnanensis var. yunnanensis and 74.7\% for var. pygmaea. Heat shock
   resulted in higher seed germination rates for both varieties of P.
   yunnanensis. Dominant and common taxa in these two typical forest types
   had typical traits of species known to be adapted to fire; forest fire
   did not significantly reduce number of species. Based on the above
   results, the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem is a fire-dependent
   system. Wildfire plays an important role in the community assembly for
   the semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forests, P. yunnanensis forest and
   shrub communities. Wildfire should not be viewed as a totally
   catastrophic event in forests of the Central Yunnan Plateau. In theory
   this region appropriates to carry out prescribed burning. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Fire has considerable impact on vegetation and organic soils properties.
   As we observed that the differences between vegetation of burnt and
   unburnt areas on the rich fen are visible 11 years after the fire, we
   assumed that the post-fire changes are long lasting, yet limited
   exclusively to the burnt areas. In order to check this hypothesis we
   studied spatial differentiation of physical and chemical properties of
   soils, and productivity capacities of burnt and unburnt areas in the fen
   in Biebrza National Park. We took soil samples from the neighboring
   burnt and unburnt areas, from the depth of 0-30 cm and 30-50 cm. We
   analyzed 21 parameters of the soils including: pH, ash content,
   moisture, bulk density, exchangeable K,Na, Ca, available P, N-NH4+,
   N-NO3-, total N, C, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, P; and calculated C: N, C: P
   ratios. Surface layer of the burnt soils differed significantly from the
   unburnt soils in respect of 17 out of 21 parameters. The most pronounced
   difference was observed for available phosphorous (on average 6 times
   higher for the burnt soils). The differences in the deeper layer were
   mostly insignificant. The burnt areas were also characterized by twofold
   higher plant productivity than recorded for the unburnt areas. The
   influence of fire on peaty soils was long lasting but mostly limited to
   the surface layer of the soils. In the case of particular soil features,
   the post-fire differences were modified by advanced muck formation
   (moorshing) processes in the unburnt areas. Since the fire led to long
   lasting increase of fertility, the recovery of fen vegetation is
   unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{Few investigations link post-fire changes to sediment sources and
   erosion processes with sediment yield response at the catchment scale.
   This linkage is essential if downstream impacts on sediment transport
   after fire are to be understood in the context of fire effects across
   different forest environments. In this study, we quantify changing
   source contributions to fine sediment (<63 mu m) exported from a
   eucalypt forest catchment (136 ha) burnt by wildfire. The study
   catchment is one of a pair of research catchments located in the East
   Kiewa River valley in southeastern Australia that have been the subject
   of a research program investigating wildfire effects on runoff, erosion,
   and catchment sediment/nutrient exports. This previous research provided
   the opportunity to couple insights gained from a range of measurement
   techniques with the application of fallout radionuclides Cs-137 and
   Pb-210(ex) to trace sediment sources. It was found that hillslope
   surface erosion dominated exports throughout the 3.5-year post-fire
   measurement period. During this time there was a pronounced decline in
   the proportional surface contribution from close to 100\% in the first
   six months to 58\% in the fourth year after fire. Over the study period,
   hillslope surface sources accounted for 93\% of the fine sediment yield
   from the burnt catchment. The largest decline in the hillslope
   contribution occurred between the first and second years after fire,
   which corresponded with the previously reported large decline in
   sediment yield, breakdown of water repellency in burnt soils,
   substantial reduction in hillslope erodibility, and rapid surface
   vegetation recovery. Coupling the information on sediment sources with
   hillslope process measurements indicated that only a small proportion of
   slopes contributed sediment to the catchment outlet, with material
   derived from near-channel areas dominating the post-fire catchment
   sediment yield response. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of a soil seed bank was evaluated through its role in the

   characterized by several ericaceous species. Part of the heathland was
   burnt in a wildfire on 7 April 1991, while the rest was not affected by
   the fire and used as a control. Soil samples were collected three days
   after the wildfire, in the absence of rain; 10 samples (20x25 cm width
   to a depth of 5 cm) were collected from the burnt area and 10 from the
   control. Samples were set out in a greenhouse where germinating
   seedlings were recorded, counted and identified for 17 months.
   Observations were also carried out twice in the field for 14 months
   after the wildfire by examining two permanent transects in the study
   area and recording all regenerating species. The results show a low
   correspondence between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation: only
   23\% of the identified taxa appeared both in the bank and in the field
   observations. From these species 65\% of them have dispersal types like
   autochory or barochory, that is they generally fall near the mother
   plant. In the identified species as a whole, therophytes and
   hemicryptophytes dominate in comparison with chamaephytes, phanerophytes

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{733-745}},
Abstract = {{Changes in the properties of an ash layer with time may affect the
   amount of post-fire runoff, particularly by the formation of ash surface
   crusts. The formation of depositional crusts by ash have been observed
   at the pore and plot scales, but the causes and temporal evolution of
   ash layers and associated crusts have not yet been thoroughly
   investigated. In the long term, ash crusting effects will decrease as
   the ash layer is removed by wind and water erosion, but in the short
   term ash crusting could contribute to the observed changes in post-fire
   runoff. This research addresses these topics by studying the evolution
   over time of highly combusted ash layers from two high-severity
   wildfires that occurred in Montana in 2011. More specifically, this
   research was designed to assess the potential for ash crusts to form and
   thereby contribute to the observed decreases in infiltration after
   forest fires. Results indicate that high-combustion ash can evolve due
   to post-fire rainfall. Plots that exhibited a visible ash crust also
   displayed a significant decrease in effective porosity and hydraulic
   conductivity. These decreases in ash layer characteristics were
   attributed to raindrop compaction and ash hydration resulting in the
   formation of carbonate crystals, which decreased effective porosity and
   flow within the ash layer. During this same time period, inorganic
   carbon content more than doubled from 11 to 26\% and bulk density
   significantly increased from 0.22 to 0.39 g cm(-3) on crusted plots.
   Although raindrop impact increased the robustness of the ash crust,
   mineralogical transformations must occur to produce a hydrologically
   relevant ash crust. These results indicate that postfire rainfall is an
   important control on the properties of the ash layer after burning and
   on crust formation. The observed temporal changes indicate that the
   timing of ash sampling can alter the predictions as to whether the ash
   layer is effecting post-fire infiltration and runoff. Despite the
   reduction in infiltration capacity, the formation of post-fire ash
   crusts could prove beneficial to post-fire hazard mitigation by
   stabilising the ash layer, and reducing aeolian mixing and erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate woodlands are one of the world's ecosystems in greatest need

   we monitored understory plant communities in a woodland mosaic in
   Missouri, USA, as it underwent restoration via prescribed,
   dormant-season burning and mechanical thinning of red cedar (Juniperus
   virginiana) and exotic shrubs. Native species richness increased
   linearly by 36\% over this time period, driven primarily by an influx of
   forb species in thin-soiled upland areas where red cedar was removed.
   Floristic quality also increased with differential dynamics across local
   communities; forest floristic quality saturated quickly whereas
   floristic quality increased gradually over the time series in woodlands
   and red cedar-dominated woodlands. Species that underlay these patterns
   were mainly ruderal or matrix forbs and grasses with little dependence
   on intact, undisturbed habitats. In contrast, conservative species were
   rare or absent. This case study suggests that understory plant recovery
   dynamics may be slower in harsher and more degraded sites and faster in
   more mesic sites within a woodland mosaic. Our observations set a

Abstract = {{This study investigates post-fire natural regeneration of Aleppo pine
   (Pinus halepensis) forests at Ilia region (Peloponnesus, Greece)
   following the catastrophic fire of 2007.
   The objective of this study is the prediction of P. halepensis post-fire
   regeneration at a regional scale through an integrated geographic
   information systems (GIS) model as a basis for post-fire management
   plans.
   The model was developed in three interconnected stages: (1) field data
   collection, (2) development of two prediction models (based on
   interpolation of field data and multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) that
   combined factors known to affect regeneration), and (3) combination of
   applied models using Bayesian statistics.
   Post-fire pine regeneration presented high variation among the studied
   plots. Redundancy analysis revealed the positive effect of fallen
   branches and a negative correlation with altitude. Both modeling
   approaches (geostatistical and MCE) predicted the post-fire pine
   regeneration with high accuracy. A very significant correlation (r =
   0.834, p < 0.01) was found between the combined final model and the
   actual number of counted seedlings, illustrating that less than 10 \% of
   the studied area corresponds to sites of very low post-fire pine
   regeneration.
   The combination of GIS models increased the prediction success of
   different levels of pine regeneration. Low-altitude areas with low grass
   cover overlying tertiary deposits were proved the most suitable for pine
   regeneration, while stands developing on limestone proved least
   suitable. The proposed methodology provides management authorities with
   a sound tool to quickly assess Aleppo pine post-fire regeneration

Abstract = {{Prescribed fires have been applied in many countries as a useful
   management tool to prevent large forest fires. Knowledge on burn
   severity is of great interest for predicting post-fire evolution in such
   burned areas and, therefore, for evaluating the efficacy of this type of
   action. In this research work, the severity of two prescribed fires that
   occurred in ``La Sierra de Uria{''} (Asturias, Spain) in October 2017,
   was evaluated. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a Parrot SEQUOIA
   multispectral camera on board was used to obtain post-fire surface
   reflectance images on the green (550 nm), red (660 nm), red edge (735
   nm), and near-infrared (790 nm) bands at high spatial resolution (GSD 20
   cm). Additionally, 153 field plots were established to estimate soil and
   vegetation burn severity. Severity patterns were explored using
   Probabilistic Neural Networks algorithms (PNN) based on field data and
   UAV image-derived products. PNN classified 84.3\% of vegetation and
   77.8\% of soil burn severity levels (overall accuracy) correctly. Future
   research needs to be carried out to validate the efficacy of this type
   of action in other ecosystems under different climatic conditions and
   fire regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How does fire influence species richness and diversity in
   subtropical grassland in southern Brazil?
   Location: Recurrently burned grassland in Porto Alegre, Brazil (30
   degrees 03' S, 5 POT W; max. altitude 311 m a.s.l.) and abandoned
   grassland near Sao Francisco de Paula, Brazil (29 degrees 47'S, 50
   degrees 22'W; ca. 900 m a.s.l.).
   Methods: In the burned grassland, between-year changes in community
   composition and single-plot diversity, species number and vegetation
   structure were analysed in two consecutive years for plots with
   different time since last fire. Responses to fire of individual species
   were analysed. At the abandoned site, diversity, species number and
   vegetation structure were examined.
   Results: Species number and small-scale species turnover were highest
   ca. one year after the burn, and decreased as caespitose grasses
   increased in cover with time since fire until reaching a stable, but
   less diverse state three to four years after a fire. The abandoned
   grassland showed higher dominance of caespitose grasses and lower
   richness and diversity.
   Conclusions: Fire clearly leads to a short-term increase in species
   richness and diversity at the plot scale, as competitive interactions
   are being reduced and recruitment possibilities are high in early
   post-fire vegetation development. Overall community composition does not
   change after a fire. While small herbs seem to be slightly favoured in
   the early post-fire environment, no clear group of fire following
   species (absent in vegetation unburned for longer) was observed. The
   results indicate that the community is adapted to the current fire
   regime and is being maintained under the influence of fire.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean region severe wildfires occur mainly in summer and
   they are one of the main drivers of desertification in the region.
   Moreover, due to the speed and scale of climatic changes, it is likely
   that wildfires will hit this region more frequently. As a result, every
   year Mediterranean countries spend millions of euros on post-fire
   emergency watershed stabilization measures such as check dams in streams
   and erosion barriers on sensitive slopes. This study implements spatial
   analysis to evaluate the current Greek post-fire erosion mitigation
   policy and to support the decision made concerning the application of
   the most suitable response to post-fire erosion threat by fires. Applied
   to a case study area on the Kassandra peninsula, our spatial modeling
   approach of Kassandra post-fire treatment using Geographical Information
   Systems (GIS) has demonstrated the failure of the present policy and the
   need to adopt a new policy that will manage the inefficiency of the

Abstract = {{Ecosystems perturbed from their natural disturbance regimes are more
   vulnerable to establishment and dominance of exotic plant species.
   Restoration efforts that reintroduce fire have achieved mixed success in
   reducing the abundance of exotic plants. The responses of many native
   species to fire are well known; fire-adapted species respond directly
   (heat and smoke cue germination) and indirectly (post-fire environment
   benefits seedling survivorship and growth) to fire. However, the direct
   and indirect effects of fire are unknown for most exotic plant species.
   We tested the direct and indirect effects of fire on two exotic invaders
   of Asian origin, Ailanthus altissima and Lonicera maackii, in North
   American woodlands. To quantify the direct effects of fire, we compared
   germination rates of seeds exposed to varying levels of heat and smoke
   in a laboratory and placed at different soil depths during a prescribed
   fire in the field. We examined the indirect effects of fire by comparing
   seedling recruitment in burned and unburned woodland plots. Results
   indicate that neither A. altissima nor L. maackii have germination cues
   associated with fire. However, both species have greater seedling
   recruitment in burned as compared to unburned areas in the field.
   Although seeds of these invasive species are not specifically adapted to
   fire, they still benefit from post-fire environments and pose a
   challenge to restoration of fire-maintained ecosystems. Future studies
   using our approach will allow land managers to better predict how
   communities will respond to restoration efforts and to understand
   variability observed in past restoration projects.}},

Abstract = {{The present work aims to study the combined effect of drought and large
   wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula relying on remotely sensed data of
   vegetation dynamics and leaf moisture content, in particular monthly
   NDVI, NDWI and NDDI time series from 1999-2009, derived from VEGETATION
   dataset. The impact of the exceptional 2004/2005 drought on vegetation
   was assessed for vegetation recovering from the extraordinary fire
   season of 2003 and on the conditions that contributed to the onsetting
   of the fire season of 2005. Drought severity was estimated by the
   cumulative negative effect on photosynthetic activity (NDVI) and
   vegetation dryness (NDDI), with about 2/3 of Iberian Peninsula
   presenting vegetative stress and low water availability conditions, in
   spring and early summer of 2005. Furthermore, NDDI has shown to be very
   useful to assess drought, since it combines information on vegetation
   and water conditions. Moreover, we show that besides looking at the
   inter-annual variability of NDVI and NDDI, it is useful to evaluate
   intra-annual changes (delta NDVI and delta NDDI), as indicators of
   change in vegetation greenness, allowing a detailed picture of the
   ability of the different land-cover types to resist to short-term dry
   conditions.
   In order to assess drought impact on post-fire regeneration, recovery
   times were evaluated by a mono-parametric model based on NDVI data and
   values corresponding to drought months were set to no value. Drought has
   shown to delay recovery times for several months in all the selected
   scars from 2003.
   The analysis of vegetation dynamics and fire selectivity in 2005
   suggests that fires tended to occur in pixels presenting lower
   vegetative and water stress conditions during spring and early summer
   months. Additionally, pre-fire vegetation dynamics, in particular
   vegetation density and water availability during spring and early
   summer, has shown to influence significantly the levels of fire damage.
   These results stress the role of fuel availability in fire occurrence
   and impact on the Iberian Peninsula.}},

   Resprouting Trees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{In frequently burned ecosystems, many plants persist by repeated
   resprouting from basal or belowground buds. This strategy requires that
   plants reach a balance between biomass loss and recovery, which depends
   on the shape of the relationship between pre- and post-fire size.
   Previous analyses of this relationship, however, have focused on the
   size of the largest stem, which ignores the importance of the multi-stem
   growth habit that is common in pyrogenic ecosystems. We hypothesized
   that the presence of multiple stems causes a substantial shift in the
   relationship between pre- and post-fire size and in the relationship
   between pre-fire size and size recovery. We measured the height and
   basal diameter, then calculated volume and biomass, of all stems of six
   tree species before and nine months after complete removal of
   aboveground biomass via coppicing. The number of resprouts was
   correlated with the original number of stems for four species. For all
   species, the relationship between pre-coppicing and resprout size fit a
   positive curvilinear function, and the shape of this curve did not
   differ for maximum and total stem size. Smaller individuals recovered a
   larger proportion of their pre-coppicing size than larger individuals,
   but the shape of the size recovery curves were the same regardless of
   whether the analysis was performed with all stems or only the largest
   stem. Our results indicate that measuring only the largest stem of
   multi-stemmed individuals is sufficient to assess the ability of
   individuals to recover after complete loss of aboveground biomass and
   persist under frequent burning.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian fire studies in the American Southwest have focused on

   riparian fire along the free-flowing Upper San Pedro River (Arizona) by
   making temporal comparisons supplemented by spatial contrasts between
   burned and unburned sites. Pre-fire, Populus fremontii and Salix
   gooddingii were dominant species, with Tamarix sparse in the understory.
   Species differed in mortality and resprout rates, producing post-fire

   Resprout rate was low for Populus, high for Salix, and also high for the

Abstract = {{The response of an ecosystem to disturbance reflects its stability,
   which is determined by two components: resistance and resilience. We
   addressed both components in a study of early post-fire response of
   natural broadleaved forest (Quercus robur, Ilex aquifolium) and pine
   plantation (Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris) to a wildfire that burned
   over 6000 ha in NW Portugal. Fire resistance was assessed from fire
   severity, tree mortality and sapling persistence. Understory fire
   resistance was similar between forests: fire severity at the surface
   level was moderate to low, and sapling persistence was low. At the
   canopy level, fire severity was generally low in broadleaved forest but
   heterogeneous in pine forest, and mean tree mortality was significantly
   higher in pine forest. Forest resilience was assessed by the comparison
   of the understory composition, species diversity and seedling abundance
   in unburned and burned plots in each forest type. Unburned broadleaved
   communities were dominated by perennial herbs (e.g., Arrhenatherum
   elatius) and woody species (e.g., Hedera hibernica, Erica arborea), all
   able to regenerate vegetatively. Unburned pine communities presented a
   higher abundance of shrubs, and most dominant species relied on
   post-fire seeding, with some species also being able to regenerate
   vegetatively (e.g., Ulex minor, Daboecia cantabrica). There were no
   differences in diversity measures in broadleaved forest, but burned
   communities in pine forest shared less species and were less rich and
   diverse than unburned communities. Seedling abundance was similar in
   burned and unburned plots in both forests. The slower reestablishment of
   understory pine communities is probably explained by the slower recovery
   rate of dominant species. These findings are ecologically relevant: the
   higher resistance and resilience of native broadleaved forest implies a
   higher stability in the maintenance of forest processes and the delivery
   of ecosystem services. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Questions: How do fire frequency, tree canopy cover, and their

   Location: Minnesota, USA.
   Methods: We measured plant functional group cover and tree canopy cover
   on permanent plots within a long-term prescribed fire frequency
   experiment and used hierarchical linear modeling to assess plant
   functional group responses to fire frequency and tree canopy cover.
   Results: Understorey woody plant cover was highest in unburned woodlands
   and was negatively correlated with fire frequency. C-4-grass cover was
   positively correlated with fire frequency and negatively correlated with
   tree canopy cover. C-4-grass cover was highest at 40\% tree canopy cover
   on unburned sites and at 60\% tree canopy cover on frequently burned
   sites. Total forb cover was maximized at fire frequencies of 4-7 fires
   per decade, but was not significantly influenced by tree canopy cover.
   Cover of N-fixing forbs was highest in shaded areas, particularly on
   frequently burned sites, while combined cover of all other forbs was
   negatively correlated with tree canopy cover.
   Conclusions: The relative influences of fire frequency and tree canopy
   cover on understorey plant functional group cover vary among plant
   functional groups, but both play a significant role in structuring
   savanna and woodland understorey vegetation. When restoring degraded
   savannas, direct manipulation of overstorey tree canopy cover should be
   considered to rapidly reduce shading from fire-resistant overstorey
   trees. Prescribed fires can then be used to suppress understorey woody

Abstract = {{Aim Plant species regenerate after fire either through vegetative growth
   (i.e., obligate resprouters) or seed germination (i.e., obligate
   seeders), with some species adopting both strategies (i.e., facultative
   seeders). Fire season can have important consequences for the relative
   abundance of plant species adopting these regeneration strategies. The
   present study aimed to test for differential effects of fire season on
   perennial plant community composition. Location Eastern Mediterranean
   woodland in the Judea Mountains, Israel. Methods We conducted, for the
   first time, a large-scale field experiment, involving prescribed spring
   and autumn burns in a typical eastern Mediterranean woodland. We sampled
   the perennial plant community before and after the burns, quantifying
   temporal changes in community composition caused by seasonal fires.
   Results Although fire intensity and severity were consistent between the
   two seasonal fires, plant community composition differed between areas
   subjected to spring or autumn burns. The abundances of all common
   species, Pistacia lenticus (obligate resprouter), Cistus spp. (obligate
   seeders) and Teucrium divaricatum (facultative seeder), were all reduced
   by both fires. Yet, their dominance in the post-fire perennial plant
   community was retained. Differential fire season effects were detected
   only among obligate seeders, which experienced a stronger reduction in
   abundance after spring than after autumn burns. Conclusions Differential
   fire season effects on the perennial plant community resulted from
   phenological rather than fire intensity/severity effects. Such changes
   in community composition may have important implications for plant
   community dynamics, because they affect the circle of ``fire event-plant
   regeneration-fire reoccurrence{''}, determining the probability and
   intensity of future fires. Furthermore, even though the eastern
   mediterranean ecosystem is considered highly resilient to disturbances,
   increased spatio-temporal variation in fire season, may result in a new
   vegetation mosaic, differing from the contemporary one, i.e., an

Abstract = {{QuestionsHow does ground-layer plant composition respond to the
   imposition of woodland habitat restoration treatments following the
   removal of long-term pastoral management? Do different vegetation types
   have different trajectories of change?
   LocationA long-term ecological research site comprising temperate
   eucalypt grassy woodland and forest in south-eastern Australia,
   converted from pastoral use to conservation management. This has
   involved the implementation of habitat restoration treatments in
   addition to the cessation of livestock grazing and fertilizer inputs.
   MethodsWe surveyed ground-layer floristic composition over a 4-yr
   interval, in 96 1-ha sites that had been subjected to combinations of
   restoration treatments aimed at improving the condition of the woodland
   habitat for fauna: (1) Reduced kangaroo grazing intensity; (2) Addition
   of coarse woody debris; and (3) Burning. We used nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to plot the sites, and to analyse the
   average trajectories of floristic change for each of six initially
   identified vegetation types, and the restoration treatments. We
   partitioned Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures to rank individual
   species' contributions to floristic change in each vegetation type
   between 2007 and 2011.
   ResultsThe identities of the six vegetation types identified at time
   zero was strongly retained over the 4-yr observation period. There was
   generally a uniform change across the vegetation types, which was the
   result of increases in biomass of the characteristic dominant perennial
   grasses, and increases in some native forbs. The two vegetation types
   with evidence of past fertilization showed some convergence with native
   vegetation types due to the decrease in some exotic species. The
   restoration treatments had no significant influence on species
   composition.
   ConclusionsThe native herbaceous vegetation in the woodland was largely
   resistant to compositional change, although seasonal conditions
   increased the biomass of the perennial grasses defining the different
   vegetation types. However, sites with an evident history of past
   fertilization and notable amounts of exotic pasture species changed
   slightly but significantly, with some pasture species declining and
   floristic convergence with native vegetation over 4yr. These rates of
   change need to be considered in the application of vegetation offsetting
   policy.}},

Abstract = {{A key management objective for native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris)
   forests in Scotland is to extend the forest onto treeless moorland,
   below the natural tree line, dominated by the dwarf shrub, heather
   (Calluna vulgaris). At Abernethy Forest, Scotland's largest native
   pinewood remnant, establishment of new tree seedlings on moorland has
   recently slowed despite the low grazing pressure. To investigate whether
   fire would be a useful management tool to improve the rate of
   regeneration of Scots pine, an experiment was carried out in 10 plots,
   on open moorland, on shallow peat soil, c 300 m from the forest edge. At
   each plot, 10 small exclosures were established, two for each of four
   burning treatments, and two controls. Within each exclosure, 100 Scots
   pine seeds were sown and the numbers of seedlings resulting were counted
   after 2, 11 and 30 months. Exclosures substantially reduced seed and
   seedling predation by mammals and invertebrates. The four burning
   treatments were single and double burns in the year of sowing, and
   single and double burns 1 year before sowing. Single burns removed
   largely heather, whilst second burns removed more of the moss. Burnt
   areas had 3.5 times (95\% confidence limits 1.5-8.1) the number of
   seedlings established as controls, 2 months after sowing. There was no
   significant additional effect on seedling numbers of either double
   burning or year of burn. Slower moving fires and, to some extent,
   shallower post-fire moss/litter depths, were associated with more
   seedlings establishing. Seedling numbers declined by 18\% between months
   2 and 11 and by 27\% between months 11 and 30. The pattern of these
   declines was not significantly affected by treatment, post-fire
   moss/litter depth, or fire characteristics. The results have wide
   application at sites where Scots pine regeneration is a management aim,
   particularly on heather moorland, and where techniques which mimic
   natural processes are preferred. Managers at such sites should include
   prescribed burning, in conditions that produce slow-moving fires and
   shallow post-fire moss/litter depths, as a management option for
   improved Scots pine seedling establishment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In urban environments, woodland areas are typically fragmented and
   subject to invasive species encroachment, woody overgrowth, and natural
   succession. In response to negative impacts, conservationists and land
   managers have implemented restoration strategies to enhance the
   integrity of woodlands. Because woodland habitat is important for bats
   (Order Chiroptera), alterations to forest structures may affect how bats
   utilize forest fragments in urban environments. We evaluated
   relationships among restoration efforts, microhabitat characteristics
   and overall bat activity, and interspecific variation among bats in
   response to woodland characteristics. We monitored bats in nine woodland
   forest preserves representing various stages of restoration within the
   Chicago metropolitan area in 2004 and 2005. Overall bat activity was
   positively related to prescribed burning, invasive species removal, and
   small tree density (7.7-20 cm dbh) and inversely related to shrub
   density and clutter at 0-6 m heights. There was interspecific variation
   in response to alterations in woodland structure, with Lasiurus borealis
   (L. borealis) positively associated with small and medium (20.1-33 cm)
   tree densities and inversely related to clutter at 0-9 m; Myotis spp.
   positively associated with canopy cover, clutter at 6-9 m, and small and
   medium tree densities; and Lasionycteris noctivagans (L. noctivagans)
   positively associated with more open forests. Eptesicus fuscus (E.
   fuscus) activity was not strongly associated with any measured
   vegetation variable. Our results demonstrate bats positively respond to
   some forms of woodland restoration in urban landscapes. However,
   species-specific responses to vegetation differed and should be taken
   into consideration when developing management plans.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how severe wildfires influence faunal movement is
   essential for predicting how changes in fire regimes will affect
   ecosystems. We examined the effects of fire severity distribution on
   spatial and temporal variation in movement of an Australian arboreal
   mammal, the mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami). We used
   GPS telemetry to characterise the movements of 18 possums in landscapes
   burnt to differing extents by a large wildfire. We identified a temporal
   change in movement patterns in response to fire. In unburnt landscapes,
   individuals moved greater distances early and late in the night and had
   less overlap in the areas used for foraging and denning, than in
   high-severity burnt landscapes. Habitat selection was dependent on the
   spatial context of fire in the surrounding landscape. Forest recently
   burnt at high severity may provide suitable habitat for species such as
   the mountain brushtail possum, if protected from subsequent disturbance,
   such as salvage logging. However, spatial and temporal patterns of
   habitat use and selection differ considerably between burnt and

Abstract = {{We discuss the application of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to estimate
   the distributions of patch and gap sizes from vegetation transects with
   presence-absence data. Different models of HMMs are considered. A first
   basic model, expected to be appropriate for vegetation communities with
   simple pattern structure and relatively homogeneous patches and gaps,
   consists of two hidden states, patch and gap, and two symbols,
   corresponding to presence or absence of vegetation. When the spatial
   pattern of the vegetation is expected to be more complex, such as in
   communities with a diversity of plant growth forms, the topology of the
   HMM should be selected more carefully. We propose models with three and
   four hidden states, expected to be more adequate when two levels of
   patchiness are involved, as is the case in many patchy semiarid plant
   communities. For each model, their parameters, transition and emission
   probabilities, are estimated from the observed transect data using the
   Baum-Welch algorithm, the sequence of states that maximises the
   posterior probability is obtained using the Viterbi algorithm and the
   distributions of the patch and gap sizes are thus described. The method
   is applied to characterise the vegetation patterns in two contiguous
   burned and unburned zones of a semiarid pine forest, Pinus halepensis
   Mill., in Southeast Spain. The analysis suggests a certain inertia of
   the spatial plant pattern after the occurrence of a wildfire.}},

Title = {{A burning question: what are the risks and benefits of mammalian torpor
   during and after fires?}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Although wildfires are increasing globally, available information on how
   mammals respond behaviourally and physiologically to fires is scant.
   Despite a large number of ecological studies, often examining animal
   diversity and abundance before and after fires, the reasons as to why
   some species perform better than others remain obscure. We examine how
   especially small mammals, which generally have high rates of energy
   expenditure and food requirements, deal with fires and post-fire
   conditions. We evaluate whether mammalian torpor, characterised by
   substantial reductions in body temperature, metabolic rate and water
   loss, plays a functional role in survival of mammals impacted by fires.
   Importantly, torpor permits small mammals to reduce their activity and
   foraging, and to survive on limited food. Torpid small mammals
   (marsupials and bats) can respond to smoke and arouse from torpor, which
   provides them with the possibility to evade direct exposure to fire,
   although their response is often slowed when ambient temperature is low.
   Post-fire conditions increase expression of torpor with a concomitant
   decrease in activity for free-ranging echidnas and small forest-dwelling
   marsupials, in response to reduced cover and reduced availability of
   terrestrial insects. Presence of charcoal and ash increases torpor use
   by captive small marsupials beyond food restriction alone, likely in
   anticipation of detrimental post-fire conditions. Interestingly,
   although volant bats use torpor on every day after fires, they respond
   by decreasing torpor duration, and increasing activity, perhaps because
   of the decrease in clutter and increase in foraging opportunities due to
   an increase in aerial insects. Our summary shows that torpor is an
   important tool for post-fire survival and, although the physiological
   and behavioural responses of small mammals to fire are complex, they
   seem to reflect energetic requirements and mode of foraging. We make
   recommendations on the conditions during management burns that are least
   likely to impact hetero-thermic mammals.}},

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{508-517}},

Abstract = {{1. It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are
   likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are
   supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy
   and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes.
   2. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of
   landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given
   occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape
   with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then
   subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts
   for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across
   heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at
   fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single
   home range or territory.
   3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests.
   Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density
   given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory
   size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and
   home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers
   at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with
   independently collected survey data, showing that the model is
   successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as
   relative abundance within and among fires.
   4. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for
   fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet
   elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for
   many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological
   exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range
   size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the
   Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers
   to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing
   for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation
   efforts that require snag removal.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental regulations frequently mandate the use of ``best
   available{''} science, but ensuring that it is used in decisions around
   the use and protection of natural resources is often challenging. In the
   Western US, this relationship between science and management is at the
   forefront of post-fire land management decisions. Recent fires,
   post-fire threats (e.g. flooding, erosion), and the role of fire in
   ecosystem health combine to make post-fire management highly visible and
   often controversial. This paper uses post-fire management to present a
   framework for understanding why disconnects between science and
   management decisions may occur. We argue that attributes of agencies,
   such as their political or financial incentives, can limit how
   effectively science is incorporated into decision-making. At the other
   end of the spectrum, the lack of synthesis or limited data in science
   can result in disconnects between science-based analysis of post-fire
   effects and agency policy and decisions. Disconnects also occur because
   of the interaction between the attributes of agencies and the attributes
   of science, such as their different spatial and temporal scales of
   interest. After offering examples of these disconnects in post-fire
   treatment, the paper concludes with recommendations to reduce
   disconnects by improving monitoring, increasing synthesis of scientific
   findings, and directing social-science research toward identifying and
   deepening understanding of these disconnects.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{424-434}},

Abstract = {{Although savanna trees and forest trees are thought to represent
   distinct functional groups with different effects on ecosystem
   processes, few empirical studies have examined these effects. In
   particular, it remains unclear if savanna and forest trees differ in
   their ability to coexist with understory plants, which comprise the
   majority of plant diversity in most savannas. We used structural
   equation modeling (SEM) and data from 157 sites across three locations
   in the southeastern United States to understand the effects of broadleaf
   savanna trees, broadleaf forest trees, and pine trees on savanna
   understory plant communities. After accounting for underlying gradients
   in fire frequency and soil moisture, abundances (i.e., basal area and
   stem density) of forest trees and pines, but not savanna trees, were
   negatively correlated with the cover and density (i.e., local-scale
   species richness) of C-4 graminoid species, a defining savanna
   understory functional group that is linked to ecosystem flammability. In
   analyses of the full understory community, abundances of trees from all
   functional groups were negatively correlated with species density and
   cover. For both the C-4 and full communities, fire frequency promoted
   understory plants directly, and indirectly by limiting forest tree
   abundance. There was little indirect influence of fire on the understory
   mediated through savanna trees and pines, which are more fire tolerant
   than forest trees. We conclude that tree functional identity is an
   important factor that influences overstory tree relationships with
   savanna understory plant communities. In particular, distinct
   relationships between trees and C-4 graminoids have implications for
   grass-tree coexistence and vegetation-fire feedbacks that maintain
   savanna environments and their associated understory plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Savanna and woodland were once common in the Midwest, but land use
   changes have led to increasing scarcity of these communities. These
   transitional habitats are being restored across the Midwest, but few
   studies have evaluated the response of wildlife to restoration or the
   vegetative gradient created by management. We conducted point counts for
   25 songbirds at sites undergoing savanna or woodland restoration and
   nearby non-managed forest sites across the Ozark Highlands of Missouri
   during the 2009-2011 breeding seasons; these sites represented a
   gradient of canopy cover and tree density from savanna to woodland to
   forest. We estimated density of 17 species with >= 50 detections using
   distance-based models, which adjust estimates by the detection
   probability. Bird densities were more strongly related to habitat
   structure, fire history, and landscape composition than simply whether a
   site was managed or non-managed. Mature forest species such as Acadian
   Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Northen Parula (Setophaga americana),
   Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceous), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros
   vermivorum) were generally more abundant at points with more trees,
   higher canopy cover, lower shrub density, and less frequent or no fire
   in the 20 years prior to surveys. Woodland generalists such as Blue-gray
   Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens),
   Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), Summer Tanager (Piranga
   rubra), and Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) were generally
   more abundant at points with less landscape forest cover (10-km scale),
   more large and fewer small trees, intermediate to high canopy cover,
   lower shrub density, and recent or frequent fire. Early-successional
   species such as Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Field Sparrow
   (Spizella pusilla), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler
   (Geothlypis formosa), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), White-eyed
   Vireo (Vireo griseus) and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were
   generally more abundant at points with lower canopy cover, recent or
   frequent fire, and higher shrub density. Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) were more abundant at points with intermediate
   landscape forest cover and lower canopy cover. Restored sites provided
   breeding habitat for woodland generalists and early-successional species
   of conservation concern; however, managed landscapes with more open
   canopy and herbaceous ground cover may be required for species more
   indicative of open savannas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the history of fire management in the Bontebok
   National Park (3435 ha) over a period of almost four decades. A GIS
   database was compiled of all fires between 1972 and 2009 and the fire
   regime was analysed in terms of the frequency, season, size and cause of
   fires. Since the early 1970s, short interval burning was implemented to
   promote grazing for bontebok, but from 2004 the fire interval was
   lengthened to favour plant species diversity, an increasingly urgent
   conservation priority for the park. In total, 43 fires were recorded,
   ranging in size from 9 to 1007 ha, collectively spanning 14 013 ha. The
   majority of fires were large (100-500 ha), with fires of >100 ha
   accounting for 96\% of the area burnt. The overall mean fire return
   period (FRP) for the park was 7.2 years, which is short judged by fynbos
   standards. FRPs under the old and new management regimes were 6.7 and
   10.9 years respectively. Under the old regime, FRPs in renosterveld and
   fynbos were 5.8 and 8.0 years respectively. Large parts of the park
   repeatedly experienced fires at immature vegetation ages resulting in
   the elimination of slow-maturing seed-regenerating plant species such as
   Protect repens. Post-fire age distribution was highly skewed towards
   young vegetation, with 75\% of fire-prone vegetation burning at
   post-fire ages of <= 7 years, and <10\% of fire-prone vegetation
   surviving beyond 10 years of age. Prescribed and accidental fires
   respectively accounted for 70\% and 30\% of the total area burnt.
   Prescribed burning was mostly done in March-April, and only 8\% of the
   total area burnt, burnt outside of the ecologically acceptable fire
   season. This study identified areas which have been subject to
   ecologically appropriate and inappropriate fire return intervals,
   providing a basis for informed future management and research. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Community resilience after fire is determined by species' ability to
   regenerate through two main mechanisms growth of new sprouts (resprouter
   species) and germination from surviving seed banks or from seeds
   arriving from neighbouring populations (seeder species). Both the
   mechanisms are present in Mediterranean communities. The occurrence of
   both the types in a community depends on fire history and the
   bio-geographical history determining the available species pool.
   Regenerative traits also covary with other functional attributes
   associated with resource acquisition and stress tolerance. As post-fire
   regenerative responses can be related to various ecological factors
   other than fire, we tested the hypothesis of a different proportional
   representation of post-fire regenerative syndromes in forest woody
   species along a climatic gradient in Catalonia (NE Spain) ranging from
   Mediterranean to temperate-boreal climates. Specifically, we expected
   seeder species to become less common with colder and moister conditions
   while resprouters would not be so influenced by the climatic gradient.
   We also tested the hypothesis of change in the relative abundance of
   regenerative syndromes in relation to recent fire history. We analysed a
   large database obtained from extensive forestry surveys and remote
   sensing fire records. After correction for spatial autocorrelation, we
   found an increase in the proportion of seeder species under more
   Mediterranean conditions and a decrease in fire-sensitive species (with
   no efficient mechanisms of post-fire recovery) in moister conditions.
   Resprouter species were similarly present across the whole gradient. A
   similar pattern was observed after excluding recently burnt plots.
   Therefore, post-fire regenerative syndromes segregate along the climatic
   gradient. Recent fires reduced the occurrence of fire-sensitive species
   and increased the proportion of seeder species. No significant effect
   was observed on resprouter species. Fire has a sorting effect, shaping
   the occurrence of species with different regenerative traits. Overall,
   fire seems to explain better the variability of the proportion of
   fire-sensitive species and climate the variability of seeder species. In
   addition, other factors (forestry practices and the covariation between
   regenerative and functional attributes) are likely to contribute to the
   regional pattern of regenerative syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to reveal the role of soil seed banks in vegetation recovery
   after fire in savanna, the spatial distribution and temporal changes in
   the soil seed banks of regularly burning savanna in Gambella, western
   Ethiopia, was studied. The seedling emergence technique was employed to
   determine the species composition and density of the soil seed bank of
   six sites ranging in fire severity from wooded grassland with frequent
   fires over woodland with intermediate fire frequency to forest with
   absence of fires. Species composition and density of seeds in the soil
   were compared between seasons, depths and sites with different types of
   standing vegetation. Fourteen plant species were recorded in the soil
   seed bank from the grassland and woodland sites and 6 from the dry
   forests; 60 \% of the taxa in the soil seed bank were annuals and 40 \%
   were perennials. The soil seed banks were largely dominated by
   graminoids and 48-97 \% of the soil seed bank in the grasslands and
   woodlands was of a single grass species, Hyparrhenia confinis, which was
   absent from the dry forests. The soil seed pools ranged from less than
   100 to 4700 seeds per m(2) depending upon the season. The soil seed bank
   of graminoids was nearly empty after the onset of the rainy season
   whereas seeds of broadleaved herbs and woody species able to germinate
   were still found after this time. Floristic composition, representation
   of life forms and density of seeds in soil did not correspond closely
   with that of the standing vegetation, but within graminoids there was a
   strong similarity between the soil seed bank and the standing
   vegetation. The current fire regime of Ethiopian savanna woodlands
   appears to maintain the dominance of graminoids over broadleaved herbs
   and woody plants both as seeds in the soil and in the standing
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Three aspects of the paramo vegetation's response to fires were
   investigated: the measurement of fire temperatures, general observations
   of changes in plant communities following fires, and monitoring the fate
   of individual plants after burning.
   Fire temperatures were strongly influenced by the physiognomy of the
   vegetation, dominated by tussocks of Calamagrostis spp. Temperatures
   were highest amongst the upper leaves of the tussock (sometimes > 500
   degrees C). The middle levels of the tussock experienced temperatures in
   excess of 400 degrees C, but in the dense leaf bases temperatures were
   often below 65 degrees C. On the ground between tussocks, temperatures
   were variable, whereas 2 cm below ground temperatures failed to reach 65
   degrees C.
   Plant survival depended on the intensity of the fire and the plant's
   position within the tussock structure. Survival was often the result of
   high temperature avoidance (with buds shielded by other plant parts or
   buried beneath the soil surface).
   Post-fire Calamagrostis tiller mortality rates were high and tussock
   regrowth was slow. Some other species appear to maintain their
   populations by exploiting this recovery phase for seedling establishment
   on tussocks.
   Between tussocks, changes of occupancy at the level of the individual
   plants were greater after fire than in control vegetation. Most
   transitions were random. Those which departed from random often involved
   gaps and were related to post-fire mortality, regrowth from below-ground
   parts, colonisation or, in the case of a clonal mat-forming species, to
   spatial rearrangement of rosettes. Recovery was slower at higher
   altitude. Recovery was much slower in burned plots when the upper 2 cm
   of soil was removed (along with buried plant parts) compared with burned
   plots.
   Qualitative observations suggest that recovery may consist of a cyclical
   process, mediated by the serial dominance of several species that are
   physiognomically important.
   The frequency of fires determines the amount of fuel accumulated within
   grass tussocks and some plants may be unable to survive repeated
   burning. Chance survival of species in unburned patches of vegetation
   and random colonisation of gaps may be important determinants of
   subsequent community structure.}},

Abstract = {{Our study explores the relationship between land surface albedo (LSA)
   changes and burn severity, checking whether the LSA is an indicator of
   burn severity, in a large forest fire (117.75 km(2), Spain). The LSA was
   obtained from Landsat data. In particular, we used an
   immediately-after-fire scene, a year-after-fire scene and a pre-fire
   one. The burn severity (three levels) was assessed in 111 field plots by
   using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The potentiality of remotely
   sensed LSA as an indicator for the burn severity was tested by a one-way
   analysis of variance, correlation analysis and regression models.
   Specifically, we considered the total shortwave, visible, and
   near-infrared LSA. Immediately after the fire, we observed a decrease in
   the LSA for all burn severity levels (up to 0.631). A small increase in
   the LSA was found (up to 0.0292) a year after the fire. The maximum
   adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)) of the linear
   regression model between the immediately post-fire LSA image and the CBI
   values was approximately 67\%. Fisher's least significance difference
   test showed that two burn severity levels could be discriminated by the
   immediately post-fire LSA image. Our results demonstrate that the
   magnitude of the changes in the LSA is related to the burn severity with
   a statistical significance, suggesting the potentiality of
   immediately-after-fire remotely sensed LSA for estimating the burn
   severity as an alternative to other satellite-based methods. However,
   the persistency of these changes in time should be evaluated in future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire field measurements of sediment and run off yield were
   undertaken in natural rainfall event-basis during five rainy months in
   Korea on a total of 15 small plots: four replica burned unseeded plots,
   six replica burned seeded plots, and five replica unburned plots. The
   main aim was to evaluate the effects of vegetation recovery and spatial
   distribution patterns on sediment and runoff response between and within
   the treatment replica erosion plots. Six-years after the wildfire, total
   sediment and runoff yield in the burned unseeded plots with 20\%-30\%
   vegetation cover was still 120.8 and 20.6 times higher than in the
   unburned treatment plots with 100\% ground cover, 8.3 and 6.7 times
   higher than in the burned seeded plots with 70\%-80\% vegetation cover,
   while only 1.6 and 2.0 times higher than in the burned seeded plots with
   50\%-60\% vegetation cover, respectively. The differences in sediment
   and runoff yield between the treatment plots was proportional to total
   vegetation cover, distance of bare soil to vegetation cover, magnitude
   of rainfall characteristics and changes in soil properties, but not
   slope gradient. Three out of the six within-treatment pairs of two
   replica plots showed large differences in sediment and runoff yield of
   up to 6.0 and 4.2 times and mean CV of up to 99.1\% and 62.2\%,
   respectively. This was due to differences in the spatial distribution
   patterns of surface cover features, including aggregation of vegetation
   and litter covers, the distance of bare soil exposed to vegetation cover
   closer to the plot sediment collector and micro topographic mounds and
   sinks between pairs of replica plots. Small differences in sediment and
   runoff of only 0.9-1.4 folds and mean CV of 8.6\%-25\% were observed
   where the within-treatment pairs of replica plots had similar slope,
   total surface cover components and comparable spatial distribution
   pattern of vegetation and bare soil exposed surface covers. The results
   indicated that post-fire hillslopes undergoing effective vegetation
   recovery have the potential to reduce sediment and runoff production
   nearer to unburned levels within 6-years after burning while wildfire
   impacts could last more than 6-years on burned unseeded ridge slopes
   undergoing slow vegetation recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The 2002 Biscuit Fire burned through more than 200,000 ha of
   mixed-conifer/evergreen hardwood forests in southwestern Oregon and
   northwestern California. The size of the fire and the diversity of
   conditions through which it burned provided an opportunity to analyze
   relationships between crown damage and vegetation type, recent fire
   history, geology, topography, and regional weather conditions on the day
   of burning. We measured pre- and post-fire vegetation cover and crown
   damage on 761 digital aerial photo-plots (6.25 ha) within the unmanaged
   portion of the burn and used random forest and regression tree models to
   relate patterns of damage to a suite of 20 predictor variables.
   Ninety-eight percent of plots experienced some level of crown damage,
   but only 10\% experienced complete crown damage. The median level of
   total crown damage was 74\%; median damage to conifer crowns was 52\%.
   The most important predictors of total crown damage were the percentage
   of pre-fire shrub-stratum vegetation cover and average daily
   temperature. The most important predictors of conifer damage were
   average daily temperature and ``burn period,{''} an index of fire
   weather and fire suppression effort. The median level of damage was 32\%
   within large conifer cover and 62\% within small conifer cover. Open
   tree canopies with high levels of shrub-stratum cover were associated
   with the highest levels of tree crown damage, while closed canopy
   forests with high levels of large conifer cover were associated with the
   lowest levels of tree crown damage. Patterns of damage were similar
   within the area that burned previously in the 1987 Silver Fire and
   edaphically similar areas without a recent history of fire.
   Low-productivity sites on ultramafic soils had 92\% median crown damage
   compared to 59\% on non-ultramafic sites; the proportion of conifer
   cover damaged was also higher on ultramafic sites. We conclude that
   weather and vegetation conditions - not topography - were the primary
   determinants of Biscuit Fire crown damage. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The increasing size and severity of wildfires in the western United
   States has caused a corresponding increase in post-fire emergency
   erosion control activities. Hillslope treatments, such as broadcast
   seeding, mulching and installed barriers, are applied to reduce runoff
   and erosion, as well as downslope sedimentation. However, there are few
   data to determine if these post-fire treatments are practical and
   effective. Direct measurement of hillslope erosion, particularly in the
   remote settings where wildfires occur, is time consuming and costly.
   Rainfall simulation, sediment fences and paired catchment studies have
   been adapted for measuring post-fire erosion in the mountainous forest
   regions of the western USA. The use of paired catchments to measure
   hillslope erosion and evaluate treatment effectiveness is illustrated by
   an ongoing experiment of six contour-felled log erosion barrier research
   sites. Deciding which type of treatments to use, as well as the
   locations and timing of application, requires treatment cost and
   effectiveness to be weighed against potential damage from unmitigated
   erosion. To assist in this process, a web-based Erosion Risk Management
   Tool has been developed that incorporates variability in rainfall, burn
   severity and soil properties, as well as treatment options to provide
   probabilistic erosion estimates for 4 years after a fire.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Opportunities to directly study infrequent forest disturbance events
   often lead to valuable information about vegetation dynamics. In mesic
   temperate forests of North America, stand-replacing crown fire occurs
   infrequently, with a return interval of 2000-3000 years. Rare chance
   events, however, may have profound impacts on the developmental
   trajectories of forest ecosystems. For example, it has been postulated
   that stand-replacing fire may have been an important factor in the
   establishment of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands in the
   northern Great Lakes region. Nevertheless, experimental evidence linking
   hemlock regeneration to non-anthropogenic fire is limited. To clarify
   this potential relationship, we monitored vegetation dynamics following
   a rare lightning-origin crown fire in a Wisconsin hemlock-hardwood
   forest. We also studied vegetation in bulldozer-created fire breaks and
   adjacent undisturbed forest. Our results indicate that hemlock
   establishment was rare in the burned area but moderately common in the
   scarified bulldozer lines compared to the reference area.
   Early-successional, non-arboreal species including Rubus spp., Vaccinium
   angustifolium, sedges (Carex spp.), grasses, Epilobium ciliatum, and
   Pteridium aquilinium were the most abundant post-fire species.
   Collectively, our results suggest that competing vegetation and moisture
   stress resulting from drought may reduce the efficacy of scarification
   treatments as well as the usefulness of fire for preparing a suitable
   seedbed for hemlock. The increasing prevalence of growing-season drought
   suggests that silvicultural strategies based on historic disturbance
   regimes may need to be reevaluated for mesic species.}},

   big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp. tridentata) communities following fire
   in the northern Columbia Basin (Washington, USA). We sampled plots
   across 16 fires that burned in big sagebrush communities from 5 to 28
   years ago, and also sampled nearby unburned locations. Mixed-effects
   models demonstrated that density of large-mature big sagebrush plants
   and percentage cover of big sagebrush were higher with time since fire
   and in plots with more precipitation during the winter immediately
   following fire, but were lower when precipitation the next winter was
   higher than average, especially on soils with higher available water
   supply, and with greater post-fire mortality of mature big sagebrush
   plants. Bunchgrass cover 5 to 28 years after fire was predicted to be
   lower with higher cover of both shrubs and non-native herbaceous
   species, and only slightly higher with time. Post-fire recovery of big

Abstract = {{Fire has important consequences on vegetation dynamics. In fire-prone
   areas, natural selection favors plant species, characterized by a large
   soil seed bank, and that their germination is stimulated by fire.
   Although seed germination stimulated by fire heat is common in the
   eastern Mediterranean Basin, only little is known about germination
   stimulation by smoke. We examined the interactive effect of aerosol
   smoke and fire history on the germinable soil seed bank (GSSB) community
   in eastern Mediterranean woodlands.
   We collected soil samples from sites that have been subjected to
   different fire frequencies during the last four decades and exposed them
   to aerosol smoke, with or without watering. By documenting the seed
   germination patterns characterizing these samples, we could test for
   changes in the abundance and richness of the germinable seeds in the
   soil.
   Total GSSB density was higher in sites that were burned more frequently
   during the last four decades. Exposure to aerosol smoke increased the
   GSSB density, and this pattern was more pronounced in samples
   originating from sites burned more frequently, as well as among annual
   species. Notably, exposing wet samples to aerosol smoke caused a
   significant reduction in GSSB density and richness. These results
   highlight the importance of exploring germination responses using intact
   soil samples, rather than synthetic seed communities. Moreover, our
   findings emphasize the important role smoke plays in shaping post-fire
   succession processes in the Mediterranean Basin, mainly by stimulating
   the germination of annual species.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire spatial distribution of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)
   BSP) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) regenerations were studied in
   the Reserve faunique Ashuapmushuan, Quebec.  The main factors analysed
   were (i) effects of organic matter thickness on growth and regneration,
   (ii) spatial distribution type of the regeneration, (iii) effects of
   burned stems on this distribution, and (iv) links between spatial
   distribution of the regeneration and the thickness of the post-fire
   residual organic matter.  A strong correlation was observed between the
   presence of seedlings and the thickness of the post-fire residual
   organic matter.  However, jack pine was much more efficient in getting
   established on microsites with thicker organic matter.  Spatial
   distribution of the regeneration has a tendency to spread, following
   Blackman's dispersion coefficient, while adult individuals of the
   original population follow a more random pattern; this suggests that
   some seedling mortality, induced by seedling density, is to be expected.
   Regeneration shows a spatial (point correlation coefficient) with trees
   of the original population, thus showing up the post-fire perpetuation
   of the individuals on the same microsites.  Finally, the residual
   organic matter thickness on the ground seems without significant
   influence on the overall growth of jack pine and black spruce seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is likely to result in an increased frequency of extreme
   fire events, including more large-extent wildfires. The effects of fire
   extent on post-fire faunal recovery are poorly understood. Effects on
   invertebrate detritivores are of particular interest due to their
   functional importance in litter breakdown. We asked if distance from
   fire edge affected the composition and morphological traits of a key
   group of large invertebrate detritivores: cockroaches (Blattodea) 6years
   after fire. We used six replicate transects in herb-rich foothill
   habitat in areas that were severely burnt during the 2009 Black Saturday
   fires, north-east of Melbourne, Australia. Transects extended from
   unburnt controls up to 5km into large extent burns. Habitat variables
   were measured and cockroach abundances were recorded using artificial
   habitats comprised of stacked egg trays. Cockroach morphological traits
   were recorded in the laboratory. Multivariate generalized linear models
   revealed that habitats varied with transect, but not distance into the
   burn, suggesting recovery of habitat features relevant to cockroaches.
   Distance from burn did not affect the species richness or abundance of
   cockroaches, but both richness and abundance increased with bark and
   litter cover and decreased at lower temperatures. Cockroach assemblage
   composition responded significantly to distance into burn, transect and
   habitat variables, although only Platyzosteria similis was negatively
   associated with distance into the burn. Fourth corner models including
   traits did not provide greater predictive power than models including
   only species abundances and environmental variables. Wing presence,
   which was associated with smaller body size, did not affect site
   occupancy. Although species traits did not predict cockroach responses,
   our work shows that distance into a fire, a surrogate for fire extent,
   continued to be an important determinant of post-fire assemblages 6years
   after fire. An increase in large-extent fires may reduce the
   recolonization potential of some cockroach species, potentially limiting
   their functional importance in litter breakdown.}},

   land forests in the headwater regions of the Oldman River Basin,

   characteristic of the region (baseflow, spring melt, and stormflow).
   Stream discharges reflected runoff regimes consistent with high regional
   precipitation and the high relief physiographic setting of the study
   area. Suspended sediment concentrations and yields were significantly
   higher in both burned and post-fire salvage logged watersheds than in
   unburned watersheds and were strongly influenced by topographic and
   hydro-climatic controls. Sediment availability was much higher in both
   the burned and post-fire salvage logged watersheds but it varied
   strongly with flow condition, particularly during the snowmelt freshet

Title = {{Evaluating post-wildfire logging-slash cover treatment to reduce
   hillslope erosion after salvage logging using ground measurements and
   remote sensing}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Abstract = {{Continuing long and extensive wildfire seasons in the Western US
   emphasize the need for better understanding of wildfire impacts
   including post-fire management scenarios. Advancements in our
   understanding of post-fire hillslope erosion and watershed response such
   as flooding, sediment yield, and debris flows have recently received
   considerable attention. The potential impacts of removing dead trees,
   called salvage logging, has been studied, however the use of remotely
   sensed imagery after salvage logging to evaluate spatial patterns and
   recovery is novel. The 2015 North Star Fire provided an opportunity to
   evaluate hillslope erosion reduction using two field experiments and
   coincidental remotely sensed imagery over 3 years. Simulated rill
   experiments with four flow rates were used to quantify hillslope erosion
   on skidder trails with and without added logging slash compared with a
   burned-only control. Seven replicated hillslope silt fence plots with
   the same treatments were also evaluated for natural rainfall events.
   WorldView-2 satellite imagery was used to relate ground cover and
   erodible bare soil between the two experiments using multi-temporal
   Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Results indicate
   that the skid trails produced significantly more sediment (0.70 g s(-1))
   than either the slash treated skid trail (0.34 g s(-1)) or controls
   (0.04 g s(-1)) with the simulated rill experiment. Similarly, under
   natural rainfall conditions sediment yield from hillslope silt fence
   plots was significantly greater for the skid trail (3.42 Mg ha(-1)) than
   either the slash treated skid trail (0.18 Mg ha(-1)) or controls (0 Mg
   ha(-1)). An NDVI value of 0.32 on all plots over all years corresponded
   to a ground cover of about 60\% which is an established threshold for
   erosion reduction. Significant relationships between NDVI, ground cover,
   and sediment values suggest that NDVI may help managers evaluate ground
   cover and erosion potential remotely after disturbances such as a
   wildfire or salvage logging.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Fire severity in forests is often defined in terms of post-fire tree
   mortality, yet the influences on tree mortality following fire are not
   fully understood. Pre-fire growth may serve as an index of vigour,
   indicating resource availability and the capacity to recover from injury
   and defend against pests. For trees that are not killed immediately by
   severe fire injury, tree growth patterns could therefore partially
   predict post-fire mortality probabilities. Here, we consider the
   influence of multiple growth patterns on post-fire tree mortality for
   three common conifer species in the western USA. Using observations from
   1 to 9 years following prescribed fires in USA national parks across
   five western states, we show that post-fire conifer mortality was
   related not only to fire-caused injuries (crown scorch and bole char),
   but also to average growth rate and long-term (25 years) growth patterns
   (counts of abrupt growth declines and possibly growth trends). Our
   results suggest that pre-fire conditions affecting tree vigour may
   influence post-fire tree mortality probabilities. Environmental
   conditions (such as rising temperatures and moisture stress),
   independent of fire intensity, may thus cause expressed fire severity to
   increase in western forests.}},

   not converge to the assumed pre-burn condition. It is probable that this
   difference relates to the slow rates of establishment of certain
   vegetation components that make up the pre-burn condition of the plots.

Abstract = {{Afforestation after land abandonment and the occurrence of large fires
   have significantly altered the composition of pine-oak ecosystems in the
   Mediterranean since 1950s, the latter favouring the prevalence of oak
   forests and shrublands to that of pine forests. Nevertheless, our
   ability to integrate the processes driving these changes in modelling
   tools and to project them under future global change scenarios is
   scarce. This study aims at investigating how Mediterranean forest
   landscape composition and seral stages may be affected by mid-term
   changes in fire regime and climate. Taking Catalonia (NE Spain) as study
   area, we predicted yearly changes in forest landscape composition using
   the MEDFIRE model which allows assessing the effects of different fire
   regimes on landscape dynamics such as post-fire regeneration and
   afforestation. We considered three climatic treatments based on observed
   and projected climate, two fire regimes largely differing in the amount
   of area burnt and the number of large fires, and two fire suppression
   strategies. While projected afforestation continued to increase forest
   cover in the 2050 horizon, a climate-related harsher fire regime (higher
   amounts of area burnt) accelerated a shift towards landscapes
   progressively dominated by oaks and shrublands, thus precluding general
   forest maturation. Fire-sensitive pine species contributed to net forest
   cover loss in the worst scenarios. An active fire suppression strategy
   partially compensated the effects of a climate-related harsher fire
   regime on pine forest loss and rejuvenation, whereas variability in
   climate projections weakly affected spatial fire allocation and
   afforestation. Our results highlight the need to explicitly incorporate
   fire suppression strategies in forest landscape composition forecasts in
   the Mediterranean. At mid-term, large-scale afforestation, post-fire
   forest rejuvenation and landscape composition changes may alter forest
   ecosystem functioning and potentially interact with fire suppression
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Fire severity is a key factor for management of post-fire vegetation
   regeneration strategies because it quantifies the impact of fire,

   estimation of fire severity based on terrestrial observation by
   satellite imagery. In order to avoid the implicit limitations of this
   kind of data, this work employed an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
   carrying a high-resolution multispectral sensor including green, red,
   near-infrared, and red edge bands. Flights were carried out pre- and
   post-controlled fire in a Mediterranean forest. The products obtained
   from the UAV-photogrammetric projects based on the Structure from Motion
   (SfM) algorithm were a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and multispectral
   images orthorectified in both periods and co-registered in the same
   absolute coordinate system to find the temporal differences (d) between
   pre- and post-fire values of the Excess Green Index (EGI), Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Red Edge
   (NDRE) index. The differences of indices (dEGI, dNDVI, and dNDRE) were
   reclassified into fire severity classes, which were compared with the
   reference data identified through the in situ fire damage location and
   Artificial Neural Network classification. Applying an error matrix
   analysis to the three difference of indices, the overall Kappa
   accuracies of the severity maps were 0.411, 0.563, and 0.211 and the
   Cramer's Value statistics were 0.411, 0.582, and 0.269 for dEGI, dNDVI,
   and dNDRE, respectively. The chi-square test, used to compare the
   average of each severity class, determined that there were no
   significant differences between the three severity maps, with a 95\%
   confidence level. It was concluded that dNDVI was the index that best
   estimated the fire severity according to the UAV flight conditions and

Abstract = {{1. Fire-killed timber is considered as a loss of potential revenues and
   is thus increasingly salvaged, though not without concerns for
   biodiversity conservation. Indeed, a large diversity of burn-associated
   saproxylic beetles use recently burned trees.
   2. This study intends to reduce potential impacts of salvage logging on
   biodiversity by identifying high conservation value forests (HCVFs) for
   burn-associated beetles, which are considered the most at risk.
   3. In five burns ignited naturally in 2010 in the eastern Canadian
   boreal forest, we selected 31 and 29 stands of black spruce and jack
   pine respectively. Three 50-cm bole segments were retrieved from each
   stand and placed in emergence cages to measure tree utilisation by
   saproxylic beetles. This yielded 7235 beetles from 103 taxa, of which 67
   were considered rare (<5\% occurrence in logs) and 36 as common taxa
   (>5\% occurrence in logs).
   4. Among the common taxa, we identified six groups of ecologically
   related species using co-occurrence-based hierarchical clustering, among
   which three were mainly formed by opportunistic species that are
   currently of little concern in a post-fire logging context. The three
   other groups were formed by burn-associated species that could be
   affected by salvage logging.
   5. HCVFs include jack pine stands and large trees of either tree species
   of low-to mid-range burn severity. We also recommend retaining the
   periphery of burned stands, as ecotones are rich habitats used by
   several burn-associated species that are found in low numbers in green
   forests but they benefit from burned habitats by increasing their
   populations significantly.}},

Title = {{Severe wildfire exposes remnant peat carbon stocks to increased

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{The potential of high severity wildfires to increase global terrestrial
   carbon emissions and exacerbate future climatic warming is of
   international concern. Nowhere is this more prevalent than within high
   latitude regions where peatlands have, over millennia, accumulated
   legacy carbon stocks comparable to all human CO2 emissions since the
   beginning of the industrial revolution. Drying increases rates of peat
   decomposition and associated atmospheric and aquatic carbon emissions.
   The degree to which severe wildfires enhance drying under future
   climates and induce instability in peatland ecological communities and
   carbon stocks is unknown. Here we show that high burn severities
   increased post-fire evapotranspiration by 410\% within a feather moss
   peatland by burning through the protective capping layer that restricts
   evaporative drying in response to low severity burns. High burn
   severities projected under future climates will therefore leave
   peatlands that dominate dry sub-humid regions across the boreal, on the
   edge of their climatic envelopes, more vulnerable to intense post-fire
   drying, inducing high rates of carbon loss to the atmosphere that
   amplify the direct combustion emissions.}},

Title = {{Relevance of soil seed bank and seed rain to immediate seed supply after
   a large wildfire}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{449-458}},
Abstract = {{We examined the density and composition of the immediate seed supply
   (i.e. instant potential post-fire germination from soil seed bank and
   off-site seed rain) after a large wildfire in a sub-Mediterranean pine
   forest. We also tested the effects of fire severity and distance from
   unburned edges on the density and composition of the seed bank and the
   immediate off-site seed rain. Our results showed that although seed
   density did not differ between them, their composition was markedly
   different. The soil seed bank was dominated by species from the Fabaceae
   family with limited dispersal mechanisms such as autochory and
   barochory, whereas the seed rain was mainly composed of species from the
   Asteraceae family with wind-dispersed seeds. These patterns were not
   affected either by fire severity or distance from the fire edge. The
   main conclusion of the study is that both the soil seed bank and the
   seed rain play an important role in providing seeds for immediate
   regeneration after a large wildfire throughout the burned area. We
   suggest that the role of seed rain on immediate post-fire recovery of
   Mediterranean plant communities might be more important than has
   previously been thought. However, the effective role of this group of
   species on the longer term should be evaluated.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Question: What are the main forces driving natural regeneration in
   burned mature Mediterranean forests in the medium-long term and what are
   the likely successional trajectories of unmanaged vegetation?
   Location: Valencia Region, eastern Spain.
   Methods: A wildfire burned 33 000 ha of Pinus halepensis and P. pinaster
   forest in 1979, and subsequent smaller wildfires took place between 1984
   and 1996. The study was designed to sample the range of environmental
   and disturbance (fire recurrence and land use) conditions. The territory
   was classified into 17 different geomorphological and fire-recurrence
   units. Vegetation cover and floristic composition were measured oil a
   total of 113 plots (1000 m(2) each) randomly selected within these
   units.
   Results: The results show that 23 years after the fire the regenerated
   vegetation consists of successional shrublands, and that forest
   ecosystem resilience can be very low. The vegetation presents a strong
   correlation with most of the environmental variables, but fire (one or
   two fires), soil type and land use (in that order) are the main drivers
   of vegetation composition. Quercus coccifera shrublands persist on
   limestone soils while diverse types of other shrublands (dominated by
   seeder species) are found on marl soils.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that disturbance factors
   strongly coupled to human activities, such as land use and fire, play a
   critical role in the current state of vegetation. Fire creates
   vegetation patches in different successional states while land use and
   soil type define the different types of shrubland in terms of their
   specific composition.}},

Abstract = {{Fire severity mapping is conventionally accomplished through the
   interpretation of aerial photography or the analysis of moderate- to
   coarse-spatial-resolution pre- and post-fire satellite imagery. Although
   these methods are well established, there is a demand from both forest
   managers and fire scientists for higher-spatial-resolution fire severity
   maps. This study examines the utility of high-spatial-resolution
   post-fire imagery and digital aerial photogrammetric point clouds
   acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to produce integrated
   fire severity-land cover maps. To accomplish this, a suite of spectral,
   structural and textural variables was extracted from the UAV-acquired
   data. Correlation-based feature selection was used to select subsets of
   variables to be included in random forest classifiers. These classifiers
   were then used to produce disturbance-based land cover maps at 5- and
   1-m spatial resolutions. By analysing maps produced using different
   variables, the highest-performing spectral, structural and textural
   variables were identified. The maps were produced with high overall
   accuracies (5 m, 89.5 +/- 1.4\%; 1 m, 85.4 +/- 1.5\%), with the 1-m
   classification produced at slightly lower accuracies. This reduction was
   attributed to the inclusion of four additional classes, which increased
   the thematic detail enough to outweigh the differences in accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In predator-free large herbivore populations, where density-dependent
   feedbacks occur at the limit where forage resources can no longer
   support the population, environmental catastrophes may play a
   significant role in population regulation. The potential role of fire as
   a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly
   understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the
   affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During
   September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18\% population
   mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National
   Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns
   of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population
   physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress)
   levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth
   rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response
   post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement
   with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more
   time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds.
   Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into
   non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement
   rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and
   formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased
   significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels
   did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile
   age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure.
   Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5\% p.a., and
   at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous
   level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen
   in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts,
   follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free
   large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire
   therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental
   catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population
   limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during ``hot-fire''
   conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e.
   removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population
   regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for
   conservation areas.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), a
   recently introduced trend analysis technique, was employed for the
   detection of fire-induced changes in a Mediterranean ecosystem. BFAST
   enables the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal and noise
   components, resulting in the detection of gradual and rapid land cover
   changes. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series
   derived from the MODIS and VEGETATION (VGT) standard products were
   analysed. The time series decomposition resulted in the mapping of the
   burned area and the demonstration of the post-fire vegetation recovery
   trend. The observed gradual changes revealed an increase of NDVI values
   over time, indicating post-fire vegetation recovery. Spatial validation
   of the generated burned area maps with a higher resolution reference map
   was performed and probability statistics were derived. Both maps
   achieved a high probability of detection -0.90 for MODIS and 0.87 for
   VGT - and a low probability of false alarms, 0.01 for MODIS and 0.02 for
   VGT. In addition, the Pareto boundary theory was implemented to account
   for the low-resolution bias of the maps. BFAST facilitated detection of
   fire-induced changes using image time series, without having to set
   thresholds, select specific seasons or adjust to certain land cover
   types. Further evaluation of the approach should focus on a more
   comprehensive assessment across regions and time.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{434}},
Pages = {{289-302}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how tree groups and gaps are formed and maintained in
   frequent-fire forests is key to managing for heterogeneous and resilient
   forest conditions. This research quantifies changes in tree group and
   gap spatial structure and abundance of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
   and California black oak (Quereus kelloggii) with stand development
   after wildfires in 1990 and 1994 in an old-growth forest in the Ishi
   Wilderness, southern Cascades, California. Forest demography and tree
   group and gap structure were quantified by measuring, mapping, and aging
   trees in six 1-ha permanent plots in 2000 and 2016. Tree recruitment,
   mortality, and growth were estimated using demographic models and
   spatial characteristics including gap structure were identified using an
   inter-tree distance algorithm and the empty space function. Potential
   fire behavior and effects in 2016 were estimated to determine if the
   current forest would be resilient to a wildfire in the near future.
   Stand density and basal area in both 2000 and 2016 resembled reference
   conditions for pre-fire suppression frequent-fire forests in the western
   United States. Wildfires initially promoted California black oak
   regeneration via sprouting, but oak regeneration from seed declined
   relative to ponderosa pine over the post-fire period. In 2000, similar
   to 15\% of trees were classified as single tree groups and an average
   tree group had 6 trees (range 2-38) which increased to 9 trees (range
   2-240) in 2016. Small groups (2-4 trees) had similar-aged trees while
   larger groups were multi-aged. By 2016, single tree groups decreased by
   similar to 30\%, and the size, density, and intensity of clustering
   within tree groups increased, with an average tree group size of 9
   (range 2-240) in 2016. Rates of post-fire regeneration, particularly the
   high rate for ponderosa pine, drove spatial dynamics in tree group and
   gap structure. Although the size and frequency of canopy gaps were
   similar in 2000 and 2016, the density of seedlings and saplings in gaps
   was higher in 2016, and large gaps were being fragmented by gap filling.
   Potential fire behavior predicted surface fire and low overstory tree
   mortality, suggesting the current forest would be resilient to a
   wildfire. However, burning will be necessary in the future to reduce the
   demographic pressure of ponderosa pine, promote black oak, and to
   maintain and create future spatial heterogeneity. Cumulatively, this
   research demonstrates that wildland fires under certain conditions can
   maintain and restore fire resilience in ponderosa pine forests reducing
   the negative ecological consequences related to past fire exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, fire frequency has increased with population growth
   at the wildland-urban interface in southern California, USA. Short
   intervals (<5 years) between successive fires can be detrimental to
   plant species that require longer intervals between fires to reach

   regimes is of particular interest for shrublands in Mediterranean
   climates, which in general are susceptible to high frequencies of
   wildfire. Research on how fire has shaped the life histories of shrubs
   in Mediterranean climates is central to understanding how to protect
   sensitive habitat while allowing for the natural occurrence of wildfire
   in these regions. Frequently burned chamise chaparral shrublands in San
   Diego County, California, were mapped in the field with the aid of
   satellite imagery and analysed to investigate changes in vegetation
   condition and composition associated with short intervals between fires.
   Fire history, terrain and land-cover characteristics of mapped stands
   were tested to determine the factors associated with disturbed and
   converted vegetation. Results indicate that number of burns and mean
   fire interval are contributing factors in post-fire change in chaparral
   stands. Chamise chaparral is vulnerable to alteration and type
   conversion when fire return intervals are 4-5 years or less.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Human-induced changes to fire regimes result in smaller, more patchy
   fires in many peri-urban areas, with a concomitant increase in potential
   edge effects. In sclerophyll vegetation, many structurally dominant
   serotinous plants rely on the immediate post-fire environment for
   recruitment. However, there is little information about how fire
   attributes affect seed predation or recruitment for these species. We
   examined the influence of distance to unburnt vegetation on
   post-dispersal seed predation for five serotinous species from
   sclerophyll vegetation in the Sydney region, south-eastern Australia;
   Banksia serrata L. f., Banksia spinulosa Sm. var. spinulosa, Hakea
   gibbosa (Sm.) Cav., Hakea teretifolia (Salisb.) Britten (all Proteaceae)
   and Allocasuarina distyla (Vent.) L. Johnson (Casuarinaceae). We used
   cafeteria trials and differential exclusion of vertebrates and
   invertebrates to test whether rates of seed removal for these five
   species differed among (i) unburnt, (ii) burnt-edge (approx. 10 m from
   unburnt vegetation) and (iii) burnt-interior (approx. 100 m from unburnt
   vegetation) locations. When all animals had access to seeds, seeds were
   removed at lower rates from burnt-interior areas than from other
   locations. Vertebrates (small mammals) showed this pattern markedly the
   first time the experiment was run, but in a repeat trial this effect
   disappeared. Rate of seed removal by invertebrates differed among plant
   species but we did not detect any such differences for removal by
   vertebrates. Overall rates of seed removal also differed significantly
   between the two fires studied. Our results indicate that small mammal
   seed predation can be substantial for large-seeded serotinous shrubs,
   and that differences in the perimeter: area ratio, severity or size of a
   fire are likely to affect seed predation.}},

Abstract = {{Chaparral watersheds associated with Mediterranean-type climate are
   distributed over five regions of the world. Because brushland soils are
   often shallow with low water holding capacities, and are on slopes prone
   to erosion, disturbances such as fire can adversely affect their
   physical properties. Fire can also increase the spatial coverage of soil
   water repellency, reducing infiltration, and, in turn, increasing
   overland flow and subsequent erosion. We studied the impacts of fire on
   soil properties by collecting data before and after a prescribed burn
   conducted during Spring 2001 on the San Dimas Experimental Forest,
   southern California. The fire removed the litter layer and destroyed the
   weak surface soil structure; leaving a thin band of ash and char on top
   of, and mixed in with, an unstable, granular soil of loose consistency.
   Median litter thickness and clay content were significantly decreased
   after fire while soil bulk density increased. At 7 d post-fire, soil
   surface repellency in the watershed was significantly higher than prior
   to the burn. At 76 d post-fire, surface soil water repellency was
   returning to near pre-fire values. At the 2 and 4 cm depths, 7 d
   post-fire soil repellency was also significantly higher than pre-fire,
   however, conditions at 76 d post-fire were similar to pre-fire values.
   Variability in soil water repellency between replicates within a given
   15 x 15 cm site was as large as the variability seen between sites over
   the 1.28 ha watershed. The increase in post-fire persistence of water
   repellency was largest beneath ceanothus (Ceanothus crassifolius) as
   compared to a small increase beneath chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum).
   However, pre-fire persistence was higher under chamise than for
   ceanothus. Post-fire changes to soil properties may increase the
   watershed hydrologic response, however the mosaic distribution of water
   repellency may lead to a less severe increase in hydrologic response
   than might be expected for a spatially more homogenous increase in
   repellency. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Land managers use prescribed fire to return a vital process to
   fire-adapted ecosystems, restore forest structure from a state altered
   by long-term fire suppression, and reduce wildfire intensity. However,
   fire often produces favorable conditions for invasive plant species,
   particularly if it is intense enough to reveal bare mineral soil and
   open previously closed canopies. Understanding the environmental or fire
   characteristics that explain post-fire invasive plant abundance would
   aid managers in efficiently finding and quickly responding to
   fire-caused infestations. To that end, we used an information-theoretic
   model-selection approach to assess the relative importance of abiotic
   environmental characteristics (topoedaphic position, distance from
   roads), pre-and post-fire biotic environmental characteristics (forest
   structure, understory vegetation, fuel load), and prescribed fire
   severity (measured in four different ways) in explaining invasive plant
   cover in ponderosa pine forest in South Dakota's Black Hills.
   Environmental characteristics (distance from roads and post-fire forest
   structure) alone provided the most explanation of variation (26\%) in
   post-fire cover of Verbascum thapsus (common mullein), but a combination
   of surface fire severity and environmental characteristics (pre-fire
   forest structure and distance from roads) explained 36-39\% of the
   variation in post-fire cover of Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and all
   invasives together. For four species and all invasives together, their
   pre-fire cover explained more variation (26-82\%) in post-fire cover
   than environmental and fire characteristics did, suggesting one strategy
   for reducing post-fire invasive outbreaks may be to find and control
   invasives before the fire. Finding them may be difficult, however, since
   pre-fire environmental characteristics explained only 20\% of variation
   in pre-fire total invasive cover, and less for individual species. Thus,
   moderating fire intensity or targeting areas of high severity for
   post-fire invasive control may be the most efficient means for reducing
   the chances of post-fire invasive plant outbreaks when conducting
   prescribed fires in this region. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Early establishment of white spruce (Picea glauca) in mixedwood boreal
   forest stands following fire was examined at several times-since-fire
   (1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 14-years). Abiotic and biotic conditions in the stands
   were assessed at two scales, tree plot (5 in x 5 in) and microsite (1 m
   x 1 m), along with presence, density and height of white spruce
   seedlings. Germination and survival of seed sown 1- and 4-years post
   fire were quantified. Survival and growth of nursery-grown seedlings,
   and mycorrhizal colonization, survival and growth of sterile seedlings,
   planted 1-year post-fire were assessed. At the tree plot scale, presence
   of white spruce seedlings 1-year post-fire could be reliably predicted
   by organic layer depth and distance to and strength of seed source. In
   contrast, none of the biotic or abiotic factors measured was strongly
   correlated with occurrence or density of white spruce seedlings 6- and
   14- years post-fire. At the microsite scale, seedling recruitment
   immediately post-fire was limited to a distinct subset of available
   microsites (greater \% cover of downed wood and moss, lower \% cover of
   litter and herbaceous vegetation). Likewise, seedling occurrence in
   older bums was associated with distinct microsite conditions; although
   this was more likely an effect of white spruce presence, rather than the
   cause. Less than 3\% of seed sown 1 yr post-fire survived to become 1 yr
   old germinants, survival was 41\% over the next three years.
   Availability of suitable regeneration microsites declines rapidly with
   time-since-fire; less than 0.3\% of seed sown 4 yrs post-fire survived
   one year. High rates of mycorrhizal colonization were found on white
   spruce seedlings planted 1-year post-fire, including early and late
   stage fungal species. Micrositc characteristics were only weakly
   correlated with mycorrhizal fungal communities. We propose that
   immediate post-fire recruitment of white spruce is a key process in
   mixedwood boreal succession.}},

Volume = {{214}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{587-596}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fire activity in the North American boreal region is projected to
   increase under a warming climate and trigger changes in vegetation
   composition. In black spruce forests of interior Alaska, fire severity
   impacts residual organic layer depth which is strongly linked to the
   relative dominance of deciduous versus coniferous trees in early
   succession. These alternate successional pathways may be reinforced by
   biogeochemical processes that affect the relative ability of deciduous
   versus coniferous trees to acquire limiting nutrients. To test this
   hypothesis, we examined changes in soil inorganic nitrogen (N) supply
   and in situ N-15 root uptake by aspen (Populus tremuloides) and black
   spruce (Picea mariana) saplings regenerating in lightly and severely
   burned sites, 16 years following fire. Fire severity did not impact the
   composition or magnitude of N supply, and nitrate represented nearly 40
   \% of total N supply. Both aspen and spruce took up more N in severely
   burned than in lightly burned sites. Spruce exhibited only a moderately
   lower rate of nitrate uptake, and a higher ammonium uptake rate than
   aspen in severely burned sites. At the stand level, differences in
   species nutrient uptake were magnified, with aspen taking up nearly an
   order-of-magnitude more N per m(2) in severely burned than in lightly
   burned sites. We suggest that differences in nutrient sinks (biomass)
   established early in succession and effects of post-fire organic layer
   depth on nutrient uptake, are key mechanisms reinforcing the opposing
   stand dominance patterns that have developed in response to variations
   in organic layer depth.}},

Title = {{Post-fire recovery of a dryland forest remnant in the Wither Hills,
   Marlborough}},
Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{222-228}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a major threat to remnant native woody vegetation in dry,
   lowland New Zealand. This is because the woody flora lacks specific
   adaptations to survive fire, and seedling regeneration is constrained by
   summer drought, limited native seed rain and intense competition from
   non-native grasses that are often favoured by fire. In December 2000, a
   fire burnt a 41 ha remnant of mature Kunzea robusta (Myrtaceae) forest
   in the Wither Hills, Marlborough, a dry region with little remaining
   native woody vegetation. Shortly after the fire the area was fenced to
   exclude grazing animals and oversown with pasture species to stabilise
   the soil. A study was then initiated in June 2001 to determine the rate
   and direction of native forest recovery using 15 randomly located
   monitoring plots. Plots were re-measured in summer 2001, 2002, 2003 and
   2015. Additional strategically located plots monitored the survival and
   re-growth of burnt individuals of Kunzea robusta, Sophora prostrata
   (Fabaceae) and Clematis quadribracteolata (Ranunculaceae). In spite of
   the dry climate, limited seed rain, oversowing and absence of grazing,
   woody biomass has started to recover after fire in the Wither Hills but
   slowly as non-native grasses are overwhelmingly dominant. After 15
   years, woody biomass and cover are less than 5\% of the original
   estimate for the area. However, while fire-damaged Kunzea mostly died,
   Sophora and Clematis individuals have recovered through resprouting. Our
   study site is typical of many dryland areas in New Zealand in which
   native biodiversity is part of a productive landscape and is under
   threat from fire, weeds and grazing. It is inevitable that a proportion
   of dryland reserves will be burnt each decade and our results underscore
   the need for conservation planning to incorporate fire and for
   experimental investigations to assist with accelerating native
   vegetation recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Portugal is one of the most affected countries in Europe by forest
   fires. Every year in the summer, hundreds of hectares burn, destroying
   goods and forests at an alarming rate. The objective of this work was to
   analyze the forest areas burned in Portugal in 2016 (summer) using
   different satellite data with different spatial resolution (Sentinel-2A
   MSI and Landsat 8 OLI) in two affected areas. Data from spring from 2016
   and 2017 were chosen (pre-fire event and post-fire event) in order to
   maximize the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. The
   QGIS software's plugin - Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin-which
   allowed to obtain NDVI values for the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A was
   used. The results showed that the NDVI decreased considerably in Arouca
   and Vila Nova de Cerveira after de fire event, meaning a marked drop in
   vegetation level. In Sintra municipality this change was not verified
   because non forest fire was registered in this area during the study
   period. The results from the Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 OLI data analysis
   are in agreement, however the Sentinel-2A satellite gives results more
   accurate than Landsat-8 OLI since it has best spatial resolution. This
   study could help the experts to understand both the causes and
   consequences of spatial variability of post-fire effects. Other
   vegetation spectral indices related with fire and burnt areas could also
   be calculated in order to discriminate burnt areas. Added to the best
   spatial resolution of Sentinel-2A (10 m), the temporal resolution of
   Sentinel2A (10 days) was increased with the launch of the twin
   Sentinel-2B (very recently) and therefore the frequency of the combined
   constellation revisit will be 5 days. However, for historical studies,
   the Landsat program remains the best option.}},

Abstract = {{Public lands are often tasked with ecosystem restoration that may
   include fire as a management tool in order to foster the return of
   ecosystem composition, structure, or function to a previous state. In
   some ecosystems, such as woodlands, the role of fire is poorly
   understood because mixed-fire regimes complicate assessment of landscape
   level fire return intervals and successional pathways. Management of
   these public woodlands may be difficult due to the need to accomplish
   multiple objectives such as carbon (C) sequestration and wildlife
   conservation on properties with marginal productivity. To assess the
   role of fire in affecting various ecological processes and offer
   information for future wildland management decision-making, we measured
   C storage, vegetation composition, and habitat suitability for an
   endangered bird species (golden-cheeked warbler, Dendroica chrysoparia)
   in juniper-oak woodlands with documented past surface fires within
   Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. We found significantly
   different total aboveground biomass C with average values of 5.25, 6.86,
   and 9.18 kg m(-2) of C for 60 plots grouped into recent (<40 year), old
   (>= 40 year), and no fire treatments, respectively. Interpretation of
   fire for each plot was based on fire scar data derived from a previous
   tree-ring study for the refuge. We found fire significantly reduced site
   C primarily due to reduced tree density. We also found increased oak
   recruitment associated with fires that occurred in low summer
   precipitation years. Calculated habitat suitability index values for the
   golden-cheeked warbler did not significantly differ between groups.
   However, fire may have a dual effect on habitat suitability. While
   catastrophic wildfire can damage potential habitat and significantly
   reduce regional carbon storage, our study showed that moderate intensity
   fires in dense young juniper stands promotes tree species diversity,
   favorable for future habitat formation. We conclude that fire as a
   management focus, including use of prescribed burning and fuel
   treatments to reduce wildfire risk, may be implemented on a single
   conservation property to achieve multiple expected outcomes. However,
   this requires detailed ecological information regarding woody species
   composition and population structure to help assess legacy conditions
   that influence the interpretation of present woodland conditions and
   future projections given restoration efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Seed from post-fire ephemeral plants like Yakirra australiense can form
   an important component of the diet of the bilby, a threatened
   arid-dwelling bandicoot. An investigation was conducted to determine the
   factors affecting the production of Yakirra and fire reoccurrence in the
   Tanami Desert. A simple decision model was produced to assist managers
   decide where and when to burn and what to expect regarding Yakirra
   australiense growth following fire and rainfall. The information used in
   the model may be derived from existing spatial databases that document
   rainfall and fire history and could be used to map broad-scale temporal
   change in total vegetation cover and components of habitat suitability
   for the bilby. The season and magnitude of rainfall and time-since-fire
   were the most important variables in the production of Yakirra seed.
   Rainfall >300mm within a 2-month period of intense-complete burns could
   result in >5\% Yakirra cover, and >100mm was required for >1\% cover.
   Negligible Yakirra cover occurred in adjacent long-unburnt plots. Total
   ground cover and spinifex cover varied substantially in relation to mean
   annual rainfall, but not in relation to substrate type. Long-unburnt
   spinifex cover was mostly too sparse to carry a fire in the southern
   part of the Tanami and the growth of non-spinifex vegetation would be
   necessary to boost fuel loads sufficiently to carry a fire. Generally,
   more than 41\% cover was required to carry a fire but this was also
   dependent on weather conditions. Managers should aim to burn in late
   spring or early summer to improve Yakirra production. Fire management to
   enhance habitat suitability for the bilby would be of most benefit in
   the northern part of the Tanami Desert where growth rate of vegetation
   is greater and there is little existing fire age heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is altering fire regimes. As fire regimes change, it is
   important to understand how mammals respond to these altered post-fire

   natural or prescribed fire in North American conifer forests. These
   papers used different experimental contrasts (e.g. burned vs unburned

   minimal set of information that should be presented about each fire

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{310}},
Pages = {{219-233}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Fire severity and burn patchiness are frequently cited as important to
   post-fire surface runoff and erosion, yet few studies quantify their
   effects. A better understanding of their role is needed to predict
   post-fire erosion and design prescribed burns. Therefore, this study
   quantified the effects of fire severity and burn patchiness on surface
   runoff, erosion and hydrologic connectivity using 116 unbounded runoff
   samplers. The samplers were installed in recently prescribed burnt dry
   eucalypt forest in Victoria, Australia. Sediment loads over 16-months
   were approximately three orders of magnitude higher on burnt compared
   with unburnt hillslopes while differences in runoff and erosion between
   the low and high severity hillslopes were relatively small. Unburnt
   patches were often highly effective at reducing hydrologic connectivity
   from upslope burnt areas, with sediment loads over 16-months reduced by
   1.3\%, 98.1\% and 99.9\% downslope of 1, 5 and 10 m wide unburnt patches
   respectively. Hydrologic connectivity was limited most effectively by
   wider unburnt patches (10 m) and during lower magnitude storms. The
   results suggest overall that post-fire runoff and erosion may be
   substantially limited by unburnt patches while fire severity is a less
   important factor (within the context of prescribed burning).
   Consequently, post-fire erosion models should consider the spatial
   arrangement of unburnt patches, and unburnt patches (>10 m wide) should
   be retained within prescribed burns to minimise erosion. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Fire is an important control on the distribution of plant communities on
   the Edwards Plateau in central Texas. Although the effects of fire in
   grasslands have been well studied, little is known about the recovery of
   mature oak-Ashe juniper (Quercus spp.-Juniperus ashei) woodlands after
   crown fire. These woodlands are the only nesting habitat of the
   endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia). In February
   1996, crown fires burned more than 4000 ha of woodland on Fort Hood
   Military Reservation. Permanent transects were installed in moderately
   to severely burned areas on three soils types in 1996 and data were
   collected annually from 1996 to 2002 and again in 2005. We also sampled
   36 transects in unburned areas on the same soil types in 2001 and 2005.
   Overall stem density (all species combined) in the burned areas
   recovered rapidly, at least in the smaller size classes (< 1.8 m tall),
   and, by 2005, sapling stem density (> 1.8 m tall, <5 cm dbh) was higher
   in burned areas than in unburned areas for all soil types (ANOVA, p <
   0.02). Tree density (>5 cm dbh) in burned areas remained low until 2005
   (2001: 20 36 stems/ha; 2005: 326 260 stems/ha). The dominant oak species
   recovered rapidly due to vigorous resprouting. Ashe juniper, a
   fire-sensitive species, recovered much more slowly. Only six Ashe
   juniper saplings (and no trees) were found in burned transects in 2005,
   compared to 646-871 trees/ha in unburned areas. Although Ashe juniper
   was largely absent from the burned areas, post-fire species composition
   was otherwise similar to unburned communities and became more similar
   with time (Sorenson similarity index in 1996: 0.70-0.83; 2005:
   0.86-0.88). NMS ordination separated burned communities on different
   soils more than unburned communities, because all unburned areas were
   dominated by Ashe juniper. Due to the slow recovery of Ashe juniper, it
   will likely be decades before the burned areas are again suitable as
   breeding habitat for golden-cheeked warblers. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   to their thick bark and ability to prolifically resprout from epicormic
   buds. However, despite a projected increase in the frequency of high
   severity wildfires, the impact of such extreme fires on tree mortality
   and understory community composition is not well understood. We used a
   large and severe wildfire event in southwest Australia to assess how
   fire severity impacted recruitment and survival of karri seedlings, the
   mortality of mature karri trees, and the composition of the understory
   plant community. Mature karri tree mortality was 87\% greater at sites
   burnt at high severity compared to unbumt sites and sites burnt at low
   severity. Understorey plant community composition of burnt sites was
   different to unburnt sites, driven largely by significant shifts in
   dominance. Notably, the usually dominant understorey shrub Trymalium
   odoratissimum was entirely absent from forests burnt at extreme high
   severity. These results indicate that karri forests burnt at very high
   severity undergo changes in stand structure that will persist for many
   decades, and that the structure and species composition of the
   understorey may also be altered significantly. This indication of a
   possible fire severity threshold is consistent with the findings of
   recent studies in other Mediterranean climates following catastrophic
   wildfires. This study highlights the need for further research into the
   effects of severe wildfire on forest ecosystems that are otherwise
   considered fire tolerant.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological effects of fire is important for
   biodiversity conservation in flammable ecosystems. To this end we
   quantified the winter and spring diet of silky mice (Pseudomys
   apodemoides) and heath rats (P. shortridgei) at 20 woodland sites
   ranging from 2 to 55 years post-fire. We tested the hypothesis that
   diets would differ (shift) between very recently burnt (2-3 years old)
   and mature (>= 17 years old) parts of the landscape. Analyses based on
   faecal material collected in winter (June) and spring (October)
   demonstrated that both species ate a broad range of foods, but the diets
   of silky mice and heath rats differed substantially with respect to
   monocot, seed and invertebrates. Seasonal changes in diet were also
   observed. Silky mice demonstrated a distinct diet shift, with fewer
   flowers and more seeds consumed at very recently burnt sites compared
   with mature sites. A distinct diet shift was not observed for heath rats
   as they ate substantial quantities of monocots and forbs regardless of
   time since fire. However, they did demonstrate a seasonally dependent
   diet shift with respect to flowers: in winter, more flowers were eaten
   at very recently burnt sites but in spring more flowers were eaten at
   mature sites. In line with the diet shift hypothesis, silky mice altered
   their diet to take advantage of food groups (principally seeds) more
   readily available shortly after fire. Heath rats did not shift their
   diet to the same degree, but a focus on food groups (such as monocots
   and forbs) that are accessible across the time-since-fire spectrum may
   facilitate rapid post-fire recolonisation by this species.}},

Abstract = {{Savannahs are a mixture of trees and grasses often occurring as
   alternate states to closed forests. Savannah fires are frequent where
   grass productivity is high in the wet season. Fires help maintain grassy
   vegetation where the climate is suitable for woodlands or forests.
   Saplings in savannahs are particularly vulnerable to topkill of
   above-ground biomass. Larger trees are more fire-resistant and suffer
   little damage when burnt. Recruitment to large mature tree size classes
   depends on sapling growth rates to fire-resistant sizes and the time
   between fires. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can influence the growth rate of
   juvenile plants, thereby affecting tree recruitment and the conversion
   of open savannahs to woodlands. Trees have increased in many savannahs
   throughout the world, whereas some humid savannahs are being invaded by
   forests. CO2 has been implicated in this woody increase but attribution
   to global drivers has been controversial where changes in grazing and
   fire have also occurred. We report on diverse tests of the magnitude of
   CO2 effects on both ancient and modern ecosystems with a particular
   focus on African savannahs. Large increases in trees of mesic savannahs
   in the region cannot easily be explained by land use change but are
   consistent with experimental and simulation studies of CO2 effects.
   Changes in arid savannahs seem less obviously linked to CO2 effects and
   may be driven more by overgrazing. Large-scale shifts in the tree-grass
   balance in the past and the future need to be better understood. They
   not only have major impacts on the ecology of grassy ecosystems but also
   on Earth-atmosphere linkages and the global carbon cycle in ways that
   are still being discovered.}},

Abstract = {{A forest fire started on August 8th, 2016 in several places on Madeira
   Island causing damage and casualties. As of August 10th the local media
   had reported the death of three people, over 200 people injured, over
   950 habitants evacuated, and 50 houses damaged. This study presents the
   preliminary results of the assessment of several spectral indices to
   evaluate the burn severity of Madeira fires during August 2016. These
   spectral indices were calculated using the new European satellite
   Sentinel-2A launched in June 2015. The study confirmed the advantages of
   several spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized
   Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIreXn)
   using red-edge spectral bands to assess the post-fire conditions.
   Results showed high correlation between NDVI, GNDVI, NBR and NDVIreln
   spectral indices and the analysis performed by Copernicus Emergency
   Management Service (EMSR175), considered as the reference truth.
   Regarding the red-edge spectral indices, the NDVIreln (using band B5,
   705 nm) presented better results compared with B6 (740 nm) and B7 (783
   nm) bands. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2
   will be a valuable tool for post-fire monitoring. In the future, the two
   twin Sentinel-2 satellites will offer global coverage of the Madeira
   Archipelago every five days, therefore allowing the simultaneous study
   of the evolution of the burnt area and reforestation information with
   high spatial (up to 10 m) and temporal resolution (5 days). (C) 2017

Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Vegetative resprouting, soil or canopy-stored seed banks, post-fire seed
   dispersal and germination are the major strategies by which plants
   regenerate after fires. Post-fire regeneration modes of plants are
   commonly based on the presence or absence of post-fire recruitment as
   well as the presence or absence of post-fire resprouting. High
   temperatures, smoke and ash are characteristics of fire and the
   post-fire environment. We hypothesized that heat, smoke, ash and pH will
   have differential effects on seed germination depending on species'
   post-fire regeneration strategies: serotinous vs. nonserotinous (which
   may have soil seed banks) and resprouters vs. nonresprouters (which may
   be obligate seeders). Here we examined the effects of these factors on
   the germination of 27 common east Australian species. Most serotinous
   species supported our hypothesis by showing no effect or reduced
   germination in response to heat. However, contrary to our prediction,
   all nonserotinous nonresprouting species also showed no effect or
   reduced germination in response to heat. Smoke, contrary to our
   hypothesis, had a negative or no effect on all serotinous and
   nonresprouting species, but no clear directional effect on serotinous
   and resprouting species. Supporting our hypotheses, ash and high pH
   showed positive or nonsignificant effects on the germination of all
   serotinous resprouting species, and a negative or no effect on
   nonserotinous resprouting species. However, contrary to our prediction,
   it had a negative or no effect on the serotinous nonresprouting species
   and no clear effect on nonserotinous nonresprouting species. We also
   discovered large differences in germination responses between
   conspecific populations that varied in their degree of resprouting.
   Although our data confirmed several of our predictions, the overall
   conclusion is that the responses of seeds to heat, smoke, ash and pH are
   not tightly associated with post-fire regeneration functional types.}},

Abstract = {{Herbaceous plants and shrubs have received little attention in terms of
   fire effects modeling despite their critical role in ecosystem integrity

   summarize current knowledge of direct effects of fire on herb and shrub

   components for process-based modeling, and outline research needs. Most
   herbs and shrubs are likely to be killed or top-killed even in low

   mortality of protected above and below ground meristematic tissue and
   seeds as well as the effects on seed germination. Further development of
   an organic and mineral soil heating model capable of describing heating
   patterns under a range of flaming and smoldering fire behaviors,
   validated heat transfer models for protected plant structures,
   standardized descriptions of tissue heat tolerance for a wider range of
   species, and a better understanding of the effects of soil heating on
   seed banks are required. The combination of these components would
   result in a comprehensive, process-based model predicting immediate

Abstract = {{The Cerrado biome is a complex of open forests, gallery forests and
   savanna vegetation that harbours about 60 species of small mammals.
   Despite the frequent occurrence of fire in this habitat, few studies
   have analysed its effects on the small mammal communities in the
   Cerrado. The purpose of this study was to compare small mammal
   communities of two Cerrado areas with different fire frequencies (2-3
   years or more than 18 years since the last fire). Species diversity,
   species composition, and relative abundance of the most common species
   of these communities were analysed in both areas before and after fire.
   One trapping grid was established in each of the two areas. These areas
   were sampled monthly or bi-monthly during 1 year before and 1 year after
   prescribed fires. Both areas had communities with similar species
   composition, but the protected site had more species, before and after
   fire (seven and eight, respectively), than the frequently burned site
   (five and six species, respectively). Both sites showed significant
   post-fire changes for a short time period (3 months), but only the area
   that had been protected against fire for more time showed significant
   post-fire changes in relative abundance of the most common species (the
   murid rodents Bolomys lasiurus, Calomys callosus, C. tener, Oryzomys
   subflavus, and Thalpomys cerradensis) for the 1 year following fire.
   Overall diversity tended to be greater in the protected site both before
   and after fire. Species composition and diversity indices of the small
   mammal communities were relatively unaffected by the fires. Thalpomys
   cerradensis, however, appeared to use only areas that burn frequently
   and C. callosus showed an immediate post-fire increase in population
   size in both areas, contrasting with a simultaneous decrease in number
   of B. lasiurus.}},

   in three burned pure Andean cypress (Austrocedrus chilensis) stands in
   Patagonia, Argentina. The sites, termed INTA (humid), LACO (mesic) and

   sequestered by post-fire vegetation depended on the time-lag from fire
   occurrence to date of sampling, whereas C uptake rates varied in time

Abstract = {{The first 2 years of post-burn vegetation succession of 11-13-year-old
   rehabilitated bauxite mines in Western Australia is compared to the

   ordination (CANOCO (TM)) and classification (TWINSPAN (TM)). Analyses of
   understorey species density and cover values showed consistent patterns
   of composition and abundance between the native jar;ah forest and the
   rehabilitated areas, both before and after burning. These patterns
   resulted from the intentional establishment of high densities of legume
   species in the initial rehabilitation process and proliferation of high
   densities of seeding species and non-native eucalypt seedlings following
   burning of the rehabilitated areas, features not characteristic of
   native jarrah forest. Burnt sites showed larger changes in species
   abundance and composition than unburnt control sites as indicated by
   their relative shift of position in the ordination hyper-space. This
   shift in position was generally less for sites burnt in spring than
   sites burnt in autumn. The first two divisions of the site
   classifications separated the unburnt sites and early spring post-burn
   sites from the forest and the remainder of the post-burn sites. The
   species classification showed that each of these groups was associated
   with a specific suite of species. Pit age (i.e. 11, 12 or 13 years-old

   in both the ordinations and classifications. Although species densities
   recovered more rapidly than live plant cover in the rehabilitated areas
   following burning, the vegetation of these rehabilitated sites exhibited
   little evidence of returning to their pre-tire species composition and
   abundance after 2 years. However, the high species similarity (75-79\%)
   between the pre-burn (including species only present as sled in the

Abstract = {{The genetic diversity and genetic structure of plant populations are
   influenced by processes of regeneration. Assessing the genetic
   composition of populations regenerated by different modes is important
   for successful forest management and conservation. In this study, we
   compared the genetic diversity and genetic structure of six populations
   in mixed stands with those of four post-fire stands of the noble
   hardwood species Betula maximowicziana. We collected plant tissues from
   491 adults and 266 seedlings, germinated from soil samples, for a total
   of 10 populations, and genotyped them using 11 microsatellite loci.
   Genetic diversity parameters (e.g., H-E, R-s, F-IS) in the post-fire
   stands were similar to those in the mixed stands. In contrast, other
   parameters, including the number of private alleles (P-A), the number of
   loci showing significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) and effective
   population size (Ne) differed between the mixed and post-fire stands.
   The average P-A, LD and Ne values were 1.2, 2.0 and 315.7, respectively,
   for the mixed stands, and 0.3, 5.0 and 282.2, respectively, for the
   post-fire stands. Evidence of a significant bottleneck was detected in
   two of four adult populations in the post-fire stands, possibly as a
   result of a catastrophic founder effect due to fire disturbance on their
   genetic constitution. Buried seed populations maintained the same level
   of genetic variability as adult populations, but with lower genetic
   differentiation among them. Spatioternporal gene flow, characterized by
   wind-mediated dispersal and the persistence of viable seeds in the soil,
   are key factors maintaining the genetic diversity of B. maximowicziana
   populations. Our study reveals that post-fire stands and buried seeds
   will be useful genetic resources in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Two drivers of global change that affect ecosystem function include
   wildland fire regimes characterised by frequent, severe fires and
   increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. However, their combined
   effect on the post-fire recovery of Mediterranean forests is still
   little known. We assessed the interactive effects of two fire severities
   and N addition on the rate and timing of seed germination of three woody
   species with different post-fire regeneration strategies in fire-prone
   forests: Pinus pinaster, an obligate-seeder species, and two
   facultative-seeder species, Pterospartum tridentatum (high-resprouting
   and low-seeding ability) and Halimium lasianthum (low-resprouting and
   high-seeding ability). Seeds were subjected to six combinations of
   temperature {[}control (no heat treatment), 60 degrees C (moderate fire
   severity) and 120 degrees C (high fire severity) for 5 min] and N
   fertilisation (without N and with addition of 4.17 g Nm(-2) of solid
   granules of ammonium nitrate, equivalent to three times the current
   estimate of airborne N deposition in the study area) under laboratory
   conditions. We found that N fertilisation had a significant, negative
   effect on the rate of seed germination of the three species under study.
   Additionally, we detected no differences in P. pinaster germination
   among thermal treatments; while both P. tridentatum and H. lasianthum
   had significantly higher germination rates when submitted to high
   fire-severity conditions. Moreover, the average time of seed germination
   increased with N fertilisation for P. pinaster but increased after the
   thermal treatments for H. lasianthum. These results suggest that
   increased N availability under intense wildfire regimes may hinder
   post-fire seed germination, regardless of the species' regeneration
   strategy, in fire-prone pine forests.}},

Abstract = {{This study combined a process-based ecosystem model with a fire regime
   model to understand the effect of changes in fire regime and climate
   pattern on woody plants of miombo woodland in African savanna. Miombo
   woodland covers wide areas in Africa and is subject to frequent
   anthropogenic fires. The model was developed based on observations of
   tree topkill rates in individual tree size classes for fire intensity
   and resprouting. Using current and near-future climate patterns, the
   model simulated the dynamics of miombo woodland for various fire return
   intervals and grass cover fractions, allowing fire intensity to be
   estimated. There was a significant relationship between aboveground
   woody biomass and long-term fire regimes. An abrupt increase in fire
   intensity and/or fire frequency applied as a model forcing led to
   reduced long-term average aboveground woody biomass and mean tree size.
   Fire intensity increased with increasing living grass biomass (which
   provides increased flammable fuel), thereby affecting the relationship
   between fire regime and tree size, creating a demographic bottleneck on
   the route to tree maturity. For the current fire regime in miombo
   woodland, with a fire return interval of about 1.6-3 years, the
   model-predicted fire intensity lower than 930-1700 kW m-1 is necessary
   to maintain today's aboveground woody biomass under current climate
   conditions. Future climate change was predicted to have a significant
   positive effect on woody plants in miombo woodland associated with
   elevated CO2 concentration and warming, allowing woody plants to survive
   more effectively against periodic fires.}},

Abstract = {{We present a reconceptualization of forests in eastern North America by
   differentiating the ecological characteristics of open oak (Quercus) and
   pine (Pinus) forests from closed successional and old-growth forests.
   Despite historical abundance of savannas and woodlands, the fundamental
   ecology of open forest ecosystems remains ill-defined when compared to
   either closed forests or grasslands. Open forests were characterized by
   simple internal stand structure consisting of a single stratum of
   variably spaced, often very old overstory trees and limited midstory,
   maintained by understory disturbance that controlled tree regeneration
   and allowed instead a taxonomically rich herbaceous groundlayer. In
   contrast, closed forests have dense woody growth throughout the vertical
   profile, limiting herbaceous plants. To provide further clarity about
   these ecosystems, we developed a canopy closure spectrum model dependent
   on the interactions between prevailing disturbance regimes of the
   historical and current eras, which affect either the tree understory
   (regeneration) or overstory, and tree traits of fire and shade
   tolerance. Recognition of different stand structures, disturbance
   regimes, and their interrelationships should expand understanding of
   open forests and limit ecological misunderstandings and restoration
   misapplications, thereby improving management of these once historically
   extensive ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of functional trait-environment relationship posits that
   species in a local community should possess similar traits that match
   the selective environment. The present study examines species
   trait-habitat (using Fourth-corner and RLQ analyses) and habitat
   occupancy patterns (logistic regression models) of bird assemblages in
   boreal forest stands following disturbances by forest fire and salvage
   logging. The stands differed in the amount and composition of residual
   tree retention, salvage- and aquatic-edges, degree of burn severity (all
   measured at 100 and 500 m buffers), as well as landscape-level variables
   such as distance to previously burned forests. Tests of trait-habitat
   relationships showed that canopy-nesters and bark- and foliage-
   insectivores required high levels of residual trees of low burn
   severity, with the feeding guilds showing affinity for different stand
   composition. In contrast, ground-nesters and omnivores thrived in
   salvaged areas and associated edges. In addition, cavity-nesting and
   ground-foragers were associated with severely burned stands. The
   species' habitat occupancy patterns were commensurate with trait
   requirements, which also appeared to be scale-dependent. For example,
   some fire-associated species had high occupancy probability in severely
   burned stands at small-scale (100 m buffer), which was consistent with
   their cavity-nesting trait. This pattern, however, was not evident at
   large-scale, where their feeding requirement (bark-insectivores) for
   low-severity burns dominated. Our study suggests that trait-habitat
   relationships can provide critical information to the complex ways
   species' relate to key habitat factors following natural and

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a major driver of spatio-temporal variation in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Large wildfires are predicted to occur more frequently due
   to climate change. The mechanisms by which post-fire recovery proceeds
   are influenced by the abundance of survivors, and their distribution in
   relation to habitat variability and refugia. Thus, characterising early
   post-fire demographic processes is critical to understanding the
   demographic and community-level responses of ecosystems to fire. The
   Black Saturday fires of February 2009 burnt an area of approximately
   3500 km2 in Victoria, Australia. We quantified the effects of this high
   severity forest fire on the habitat, abundance, sex ratio and body mass
   of two small mammal species, the agile antechinus Antechinus agilis and
   bush rat Rattus fuscipes. We developed a hypothetical framework to
   distinguish in situ survival and rapid recolonisation as the processes
   underlying short-term post-fire distributions. These hypotheses were
   based on expected patterns of abundance over increasing distances from
   unburnt sources, and the estimated recolonisation capabilities of each
   species and sex. The agile antechinus and bush rat were present in burnt
   sites at 30\% and 12\% of the density observed in unburnt sites. In situ
   survival, and not recolonisation, was the most plausible explanation for
   our findings. Abundance and body mass data indicated a greater effect of
   fire on the bush rat than the agile antechinus. The bush rat showed a
   shift in topographic association, whereby drainage lines acted as
   post-fire refugia. Our findings suggest these species do not depend on
   recolonisation for recovery, and that the bush rat will follow a
   nucleated recovery, expanding from topographic refugia. Thus,
   connectivity-reducing management activities, such as salvage logging and
   firebreak and road construction, may not affect the early stages of
   population recovery in remaining stands of burnt forest. Rather, ongoing
   recovery is likely to be limited by demographic rates and resource
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{Maritime pine (Pious pinaster Ait.) is the tree species most affected by
   wildfire in the Iberian Peninsula. Prediction of the probability of
   fire-injured tree mortality is critical for management of burned areas,
   evaluation of the ecological and economic impact of wildfire and
   prescribed fire planning and application. Pine bark beetles (Scolytidae)
   frequently attack burned maritime pine stands and cause extensive
   post-fire mortality throughout the Iberian Peninsula. In the present
   study, maritime pine trees were monitored for three years following 14
   wildfires in four ecotypes in Spain (11 fires in Galicia (Galician
   ecotype NW Spain), one fire in Portillo (Meseta-Castellana ecotype -
   Central Spain), one fire in Rodenal (Rodenal ecotype - Central Spain),
   and one fire in Genalguacil (Sierra Bermeja ecotype - SW Spain)). Data
   on tree attributes, crown and bole injury, ground fire severity, Ips sp.
   presence and tree survival were obtained by examining 3085 trees.
   Logistic regression models for predicting the probability of delayed
   maritime pine mortality were developed by use of generalized estimated
   equations (GEE). An ample range of response to fire damage in mortality
   was evident among the four ecotypes and different models were fitted for
   each. The most important variables for predicting tree mortality were
   total crown volume damaged, presence of Ips sp. attack and cambium kill
   rating. The results highlight the extensive presence of Ips sp. in
   burned maritime pine forests and its importance in tree mortality
   process, the ample range of response of P. pinaster, in terms of
   post-fire mortality, as well as the need to develop site specific

Abstract = {{Identifying what factors control fire severity in large fires is
   critical for understanding fire impacts and planning pre- and post-fire
   management. Here, we determined the role of pre-fire stand structure,
   directional topography, and burning conditions on fire severity in a
   large fire (12,697 ha) in Central Spain that burned a Pinus pinaster
   forest on July 2005. Fire severity was estimated using RdNBR based on
   Landsat 5 TM images. Forest stand structure was reconstructed by
   systematically sampling the burned area (n = 236). Burning conditions
   were established using weather information and a map of fire
   progression, based on which fire rate of spread and propagation
   direction were calculated. Topographic features in the direction of the
   fire-front were derived from a digital elevation model. Boosted
   regression tree (BRT) analysis was employed to relate each group of
   variables or the entire set to RdNBR. Fire severity was best explained
   by burning conditions (cross-validation correlation {[}CVC] 0.56),
   followed by pre-fire stand structure (CVC 0.34), and directional
   topography (CVC 0.17). Combining the three sets of variables, CVC
   increased to 0.71. Higher fire severity occurred in areas burning
   upslope, with high fire rate of spread, with heterogeneous and dense
   stands of P. pinaster and Quercus pyrenaica in the understory, receiving
   high solar radiation, among other characteristics. Fire severity was the
   result of interactive relationships between burning conditions, pre-fire
   stand structure, and directional topography. Thus, determining factors
   controlling fire severity from static stand structure or topography, as
   is often done, may not be appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the linkages between vegetation disturbance by fire and the
   changes in hydrologic processes leading to post-fire erosional response
   remains a challenge. We measured the influence of fire severity, defined
   as vegetation disturbance (using a satellite-derived vegetation
   disturbance index, VDI), landscape features that organize hydrologic
   flow pathways (relief and elongation ratios), and pre-fire vegetation
   type on the probability of the occurrence of post-fire gully
   rejuvenation (GR). We combined field surveys across 270 burned low-order
   catchments (112 occurrences of GR) and geospatial analysis to generate a
   probabilistic model through logistic regression. VDI alone discriminated
   well between catchments where GR did and did not occur (area under the
   curve=0.78, model accuracy=0.72). The strong effect of vegetation
   disturbance on GR suggests that vegetation exerts a primary influence on
   the occurrence of infiltration excess run-off and post-fire erosion and
   that major gully erosion will not occur until fire consumes aboveground
   biomass. Other topographic and local factors also influenced GR
   response, including catchment elongation, per cent pre-fire shrub,
   mid-slope riparian vegetation, armoured headwaters, firehose effects,
   and concentration of severe burn in source areas. These factors
   highlight the need to consider vegetation effects in concert with local
   topography and site conditions to understand the propensity for flow
   accumulation leading to GR. We present a process-based conceptual
   hydrologic model where vegetation loss from fire decreases rainfall
   attenuation and surface roughness, leading to accelerated flow
   accumulation and erosion; these effects are also influenced by
   interactions between fire severity and landscape structure. The VDI
   metric provides a continuous measure of vegetation disturbance and, when
   placed in a hydrologic context, may improve quantitative analysis of
   burned-area susceptibility to erosive rainfall, hazard prediction,
   ecological effects of fire, landform evolution, and sensitivity to

Title = {{Synergistic influences of introduced herbivores and fire on vegetation
   change in northern Patagonia, Argentina}},

Abstract = {{Question: We investigated how cattle and European hares, the two most
   widespread exotic herbivores in Patagonia, affect species composition,
   life-form composition and community structure during the first 6 years
   of vegetation recovery following severe burning of fire-resistant
   subalpine forests and fire-prone tall shrublands. We asked how the
   effects of introduced herbivores on post-fire plant community attributes
   affect flammability of the vegetation.
   Location: Nahuel Huapi National Park, northwest Patagonia, Argentina
   Methods: We installed fenced plots to exclude livestock and European
   hares from severely burned subalpine forests of Nothofagus pumilio and
   adjacent tall shrublands of N. antarctica. The former is an obligate
   seed reproducer, whereas the latter and all other woody dominants of the
   shrubland vigorously resprout after burning.
   Results: Repeated measures ANOVA of annual measurements over the
   20012006 period indicate that cattle and hare exclusion had significant
   but complex effects on the cover of graminoids, forbs, climber species
   and woody species in the two burned community types. Significant
   interactions between the effects of cattle and hares varied by plant
   life forms between the two communities, which implies that their
   synergistic effects are community dependent.
   Conclusions: Following severe fires, the combined effects of cattle and
   hares inhibit forest recovery and favour transition to shrublands
   dominated by resprouting woody species. This herbivore-induced trend in
   vegetation structure is consistent with the hypothesis that the effects
   of exotic herbivores at recently burned sites contribute to an increase
   in the overall flammability of the Patagonian landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest soils are a significant component of the global C cycle.
   Although wildfire and subsequent salvage logging are major disturbances
   in this ecosystem, their combined influence on soil organic carbon (SOC)
   and total soil nitrogen (N) storage is poorly understood. Our objective
   was to investigate the recent influence of fire and post-fire salvage
   logging on SOC and total soil N stocks and distribution in the profile
   of boreal forest soils. We measured SOC and total N concentrations, bulk
   density and pH of organic, surface mineral (0-15 cm depth) and
   subsurface mineral (15-40 cm depth) soil horizons on 14 different fires
   (burned 2005-2007) in Quebec, Canada. Each site comprised three
   treatments: a control stand (CTR), a recently burned (<7 years) stand
   that was not salvaged logged (B-NL) and a recently burned (<7 years)
   stand that was salvage logged (B-L) within 2 years after the fire. Our
   results showed that fire-affected stands had less SOC and total N stored
   in organic horizons, and that post-fire salvage logging reduced SOC
   concentration in the organic horizon, but promoted SOC and total N
   enrichment in the subsurface mineral soil. We conclude that mechanical
   disturbance of recently burned stands can contribute to the mixing of
   the forest floor and organic matter with the mineral soil, and influence
   the depth distribution of SOC and total N in the soil profile. When the
   entire soil profile was considered, SOC and total N stocks were
   equivalent in burned versus burned and salvage-logged sites. Further
   research should focus on how disturbance type and intensity influence
   the molecular nature of soil organic matter and the mechanisms by which
   SOC and total soil N are retained in the different soil horizons. (C)

Abstract = {{Questions What are the major trends in vegetation community structure
   and forest stand structure over a 14-yr post-fire period in a California
   closed-cone pine forest? Which biotic and abiotic factors best explain
   variation in stand structure at different stages of post-fire
   succession, and does the relative importance of these factors remain
   constant? Is there evidence of multiple successional pathways of forest
   stand development?
   Location Post-fire Pinus muricata (bishop pine) forests at Point Reyes
   National Seashore, CA, USA.
   Methods We quantified post-fire vegetation change from field data
   collected 1, 2, 6 and 14yr following stand-replacing wildfire that
   occurred in 1995. General linear models were used to assess trends in
   composition (plant functional groups and species diversity) and
   generalized linear models were used to assess trends in stand structure
   (post-fire P.muricata density) and determine the relative importance of
   abiotic and biotic factors on stand structure in different
   early-successional post-fire years.
   Results Species richness and diversity peaked in the first 2yr following
   fire, and then declined through year 14. Initial post-fire P.muricata
   tree regeneration was high (mean 249750stemsha(-1) in year 1) and
   remained well above pre-fire stand density levels by year 14 (mean
   15179stemsha(-1)). Post-fire P.muricata seedling density was associated
   with topographic factors in years 1 and 2, negatively associated with
   cover of a non-native herb in year 2, and negatively associated with
   cover of an early/mid-successional shrub and positively associated with
   slope in years 6 and 14. Two alternative pathways of post-fire stand
   development have emerged by year 14. A high-density, closed-canopy
   pathway (mean 40875stemsha(-1)) with early intra-specific thinning
   resulted on steep slopes and ridges with low shrub cover. In contrast, a
   low-density, open-canopy pathway (mean 1250stemsha(-1)) resulted on
   gentle slopes and where shrub cover was high.
   Conclusions This study provides evidence of divergent successional
   pathways and illustrates the importance of early-successional species
   interactions and topography on longer-term stand development
   trajectories in serotinous conifer forests. Early heterogeneity in
   vegetation establishment set the course for variability in stand
   structure in mid-seral stages and may persist into later stages.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{245-248}},
Abstract = {{The production of residual white ash patches within wildfires represents
   near- complete combustion of the available fuel and releases a
   considerable quantity of gases to the atmosphere. These patches are
   generally produced from combustion of large downed woody debris ( LDWD)
   such as fallen trees and snags. However, LDWD are generally ignored in
   calculations of fuel combusted within environments where surface fires
   dominate ( e. g. southern African savannas). To assess the potential of
   fractional white ash cover as a remotely sensed measure of LDWD
   combustion, both the proportion of the surface covered by white ash and
   the combustion completeness required to produce white ash must be
   quantified. An aerial photograph of woodland savanna fires in north-
   western Zimbabwe was analysed to estimate the proportion of white ash
   cover within a typical satellite sensor pixel. The proportion loss on
   ignition ( LOI) of wood samples from the study area was measured and
   combined with previous estimates of mean tree biomass. The proportion of
   white ash within the aerial photographs was 0.2\% ( +/- 0.06), which
   corresponded to an additional 67 320 kg ha(-1) of biomass combusted
   above that typically recorded as combusted from a surface fire in this
   environment (similar to 7000 kg ha(-1)). This analysis should be
   repeated in other savannas and forests, where pre- fire fuel loads and
   post- fire fractional white ash cover may be higher.}},

   Redistribution of Soil Organic Carbon}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Catchments impacted by wildfire typically experience elevated rates of
   post-fire erosion and formation and deposition of pyrogenic carbon
   (PyC). To better understand the role of erosion in post-fire soil carbon
   dynamics, we determined distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) in
   different chemical fractions before and after the Gondola fire in South
   Lake Tahoe, CA. We analyzed soil samples from eroding and depositional
   landform positions in control and burned plots pre- and post-wildfire
   (in 2002, 2003, and 10-years post-fire in 2013). We determined elemental
   concentrations, stable isotope compositions, and biochemical composition
   of organic matter (OM) using mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy for all of
   the samples. A subset of samples was analyzed by C-13 cross polarization
   magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CPMAS
   C-13-NMR). We combined the MIR and CPMAS C-13-NMR data in the Soil
   Carbon Research Program (SCaRP) partial least squares regression model
   to predict distribution of soil carbon into three different fractions:
   (1) particulate, humic, and resistant OM fractions representing
   relatively fresh larger pieces of OM, (2) fine, decomposed OM, and (3)
   pyrogenic C, respectively. Samples from the post-fire eroding landform
   position showed no major difference in SOC fractions 1 year post-fire.
   The depositional samples, however, had increased concentrations of all
   SOC fractions, particularly the fraction that resembles PyC, 1 year
   post-fire (2002), which had a mean of 160 g/kg compared with burned
   hillslope soils, which had 84 g/kg. The increase in all SOC fractions in
   the post-fire depositional landform position 1 year post-fire indicates
   significant lateral mobilization of the eroded PyC. In addition, our NMR
   analyses revealed a post-fire increase in both the aryl and O-aryl
   carbon compounds in the soils from the depositional landform position,
   indicating increases in soil PyC concentrations post-fire. After 10
   years, the C concentration from all three fractions declined in the
   depositional landform position to below pre-fire levels likely due to
   further erosion or elevated rates of decomposition. Thus, we found, at
   this site, that both fire and erosion exert significant influence on the
   distribution of PyC throughout a landscape and its long-term fate in the
   soil system.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an ecologically important process in many habitats. Increases in

   species of small mammals in coastal woodland in southeastern Australia.
   We used a generalized linear mixed effects model design to compare 4
   years of post-fire trapping results with pre-fire data on both burned
   and unburned sites. Numbers of all small mammal species were declining
   due to drought prior to an extensive wildfire. Wildfire significantly
   exacerbated the decline in abundance of small mammals in the year after
   fire. A return to wetter climatic conditions was accompanied by a
   recovery in small mammal numbers, which was faster in unburned sites
   than burned sites. Our results demonstrate a strong linkage between
   climatic conditions, fire, and mammal assemblages, and emphasize the

Title = {{Disturbance response across a productivity gradient: postfire vegetation
   in serpentine and nonserpentine forests}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Disturbances such as wildfire play a major role in the diversity,
   structure and composition of plant communities, however, little is known
   about the differential impacts of fire across landscapes that vary in
   characteristics such as soil nutrients and site productivity. Theory
   predicts that productivity can mediate the impacts of fire for reasons
   related to broad ecological processes and differential selective forces.
   For instance, ecosystems with lower site productivity are less limited
   by space and light and consequently experience less pronounced changes
   in these resources following a disturbance. Moreover, resource
   availability related to disturbance and productivity can affect the
   proportion of plants with competitive versus stress-tolerant life
   history strategies. In this study, we utilized a model system for
   testing predictions about productivity and disturbance that included a
   mixed conifer forest across a gradient of edaphically harsh, ultramafic
   ``serpentine{''} soils and ``nonserpentine{''} soils in the northern
   Sierra Nevada (California, USA). We predicted that the magnitude of fire
   effects on plant diversity from a 2008 wildfire would be positively
   related to productivity (higher on nonserpentine soils) and that these
   factors would interact as environmental filters driving post-fire
   species assemblage. In summer 2013 we established 90 vegetation plots in
   burned areas and 40 plots outside the fire perimeter as a proxy for
   pre-fire conditions. We found a unimodal relationship between species
   diversity and fire severity (peaking at low/moderate severity), and mild
   evidence post-fire changes were more pronounced on nonserpentine soils.
   In contrast, we found strong evidence that productivity and fire
   severity interact as drivers of species composition and functional
   traits with a higher proportion of resprouting shrubs on nonserpentine
   soils and, contrary to our prediction, more invaders on serpentine
   soils. We hypothesize that differences in biomass between serpentine and
   nonserpentine forests were not substantial enough to elicit a
   differential diversity response, possibly deriving from a weaker
   serpentine syndrome in this region that has been previously noted. Our
   study reveals that differences in productivity can mediate the outcome
   of disturbances in ways that cannot be detected through standard
   community diversity metrics, and that consideration of life history
   trait variation is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained elephant browsing and intense burning could result in the loss

   contemporary recruitment rates of woody plants were compared with the

   differed with respect to structure, extent of elephant damage and the
   occurrence of fire. Canonical correlations indicated that high extent of
   fire damage and high elephant densities did not covary within the
   woodland types investigated. Low tree densities in some woodland types
   were associated with high elephant densities and new elephant damage to
   plants increased with high elephant densities during the dry season.
   Plots with an apparent high fire frequency had lower tree densities and
   higher cover abundance of shrubs and seedlings.
   The annual rates of tree recruitment/loss in each woodland type were
   estimated through a model based on observed seedling recruitment,
   mortality and reversal to lower height classes due to combinations of

   MethodsFor each of the 24 most abundant species, we characterised the
   trade-offs among bud protection, bark traits, mortality, canopy recovery
   and top-kill, and resprouting strategies in both a burned and adjacent
   unburned area of Cerrado vegetation.
   ResultsSpecies with unprotected buds had a higher risk of dying, while
   high bud protection was associated to the ability to resprout from both
   the canopy and the base of the tree. We found three major trade-offs
   defined by bark traits and plant properties. Cerrado woody species
   invest in either (a) high inner bark thickness and bark moisture, or (b)
   fast growth rate, height and bark density, or (c) thick outer bark and

   ConclusionsCerrado species show different sets of fire-related traits

Abstract = {{Our case study evaluated the short-term (11yr) implications of wildfire
   on greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) breeding-season
   habitat (i.e., nesting and brood-rearing) and ground-dwelling arthropod
   abundance on Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern Nevada,
   USA. Two different-aged wildfire sites were sampled in mountain big
   sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana) cover types in 1998 and 1999.
   Plant communities in burned and associated unburned areas did not differ
   appreciably in species composition and wildfire did not negatively
   impact arthropod abundance. Wildfires did not increase the frequency of
   exotic plant species, such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), nor did
   wildfire have a detrimental effect on native perennial bunchgrasses.
   Wildfires were effective at changing the mountain big sagebrush
   community structure from shrub-dominated to one dominated by native
   grasses and forbs 2-3yr post-burn. However, the absence of shrub cover
   following 2-3yr of post-fire recovery indicates our overall estimates of
   vegetation structure were not consistent with published guideline
   requirements for managing sage-grouse breeding-season habitat. Although
   burning had little stimulatory effect on total forb cover 10-11yr
   post-burn, the vegetation and structural components needed to maintain
   suitable sage-grouse nesting and brood-rearing habitats were present in
   the burned site. The short-term habitat response to wildfire suggests
   prescribed fire can be a useful tool to achieve management objectives by
   manipulating vegetation structure and composition of shrub-dominated
   landscapes. However, land managers should be cautious using prescribed
   fire as a management tool in big sagebrush ecosystems if the goal is to

Abstract = {{Qualitative and quantitative coal petrological analyses have been

   thermal maximum (PETM), occurs near the top of the laminated lignite.
   The lignite contains inertinite, a petrographic term used to describe
   charcoal. The laminated lignite has inertinite-rich and inertinite-poor
   layers indicative of episodic fires and post-fire erosion. Charcoal
   clasts are derived from living or recently senesced plants and are
   dominated by the leaf stalks of herbaceous ferns and wood fragments from
   flowering plants. The charcoal assemblage reflects a low-diversity
   flora, possibly adapted to disturbance by fire, derived from a source
   vegetation subjected to seasonal surface wildfires. The environmental
   conditions leading up to and across the onset of the PETM are,
   therefore, interpreted as incorporating a persistent fire regime with
   episodic wildfires followed by rainfall and runoff events. Abundant

Title = {{A method for creating a burn severity atlas: an example from Alberta,
   Canada}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Abstract = {{Wildland fires are globally widespread, constituting the primary forest
   disturbance in many ecosystems. Burn severity (fire-induced change to
   vegetation and soils) has short-term impacts on erosion and post-fire
   environments, and persistent effects on forest regeneration, making burn
   severity data important for managers and scientists. Analysts can create
   atlases of historical and recent burn severity, represented by changes
   in surface reflectance following fire, using satellite imagery and fire
   perimeters. Burn severity atlas production has been limited by diverse
   constraints outside the US. We demonstrate the development and
   validation of a burn severity atlas using the Google Earth Engine
   platform and image catalogue. We automated mapping of three burn
   severity metrics using mean compositing (averaging reflectance values)
   of pixels for all large (>= 200 ha) fires in Alberta, Canada. We share
   the resulting atlas and code. We compared burn severity datasets
   produced using mean compositing with data from paired images (one pre-
   and post-fire image). There was no meaningful difference in model
   correspondence to field data between the two approaches, but mean
   compositing saved time and increased the area mapped. This approach
   could be applied and tested worldwide, and is ideal for regions with
   small staffs and budgets, and areas with frequent cloud.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The application of Long Term fire Retardants (LTRs) for forest fire
   prevention and/or suppression purposes can result in chemicals leaching,
   from soil to the drainage water, during the annual rain fall period. In
   leachates, large concentrations of nitrogen (N), one of the major
   components of LTRs, could affect the groundwater quality. N leaching due
   to the application of a nitrogen phosphate based LTR was studied in
   laboratory microcosms. The concentrations of nitrate (NO(3)(-)-N) and
   ammonium nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) were measured in the resulting leachates
   from pots with forest soil and pine seedlings (Pinus halepensis) alone
   and in combination with fire. Up to 30\% of the total N in the retardant
   was lost to leaching, primarily as NO(3)(-)-N. The vegetation seems to
   decrease to some extent the N leaching. The N leaching from treated pots
   with a burnt tree is lower compared with that from treated pots with a
   living tree, due to the partial N volatilization during the fire.
   Although this is a laboratory study, these results may be considered as
   rough indications of LTR environmental implications, due to the leaching
   of a significant part of the retardant's N into groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{Pugu Forest Reserve is part of the Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa
   Hotspot, recognized as one among the 34 global biodiversity hotspots.
   Fire unselectively devastated many favorable habitats and directly
   killed a substantial number of plant species in 2008 in the northern
   part of the Pugu Forest Reserve. The aim of the study was to assess
   natural regeneration of indigenous plant species five years after that
   fire. Sampling was performed using a nested plot design along three
   transects established among the topographic positions of hill tops, hill
   slopes and valley bottom. It documented 116 indigenous plant species
   from 46 families that had successfully regenerated in the burnt area.
   The stem densities of woody plant species differed significantly among
   the three topographic positions. The results of this study indicate
   higher densities of coppiced trees, sprouts, and seedlings on ridge tops
   versus hill slopes and valley bottoms. The species Garcinia acutifolia,
   Fernandoa magnifica, Rothmannia macrosiphon, Baphia puguensis and Uvaria
   decidua were among the threatened plant species under the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List that failed to
   regenerate in the ridge tops. The impacts of the fire modified the
   natural habitat characteristics of the forest, causing some plant
   species to shift their normal distribution ranges. This study concludes
   that the forest recovery observed following the 2008 fire highlights the
   importance of fire suppression in effective conservation management

   Time is critical in gathering information from burned landscapes for

   Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa), between field-based and LiDAR-derived measurements at three
   south-western Oregon (USA) sites. The sites represented a range of tree
   mortality from minimal to extensive. Our primary objective was to
   determine whether significant differences existed between field and
   LiDAR tree measurements in burned landscapes. Secondary objectives were
   to examine whether LiDAR pulse intensities in burned landscapes could
   differentiate coniferous from deciduous trees, discern fire-killed from
   live trees, and whether other tree measurement parameters were related
   to pulse intensities. No significant differences were detected between
   field-based and LiDAR-derived horizontal positions. Tree height
   differences between field-based and LiDAR measurements were significant
   at one site likely owing to dense canopy and measurement biases. Mean

Abstract = {{Mediterranean pine woodlands are strongly affected by wildfires;

   Pine recruitment was monitored from 2 to 36 months after a summer

   Pine seedling densities were consistently higher in the plots with low

Abstract = {{AimKnowledge of how climate and fire regimes affect regeneration in
   foundation species is critical to the conservation of entire ecosystems.
   Different stages of regeneration often require different ecological
   conditions, but dynamic constraints on regeneration are poorly known for
   species that regenerate only after infrequent wildfires. Focussing on a
   long-lived, foundation tree species (Eucalyptus regnans), we tested the
   hypothesis that the relative importance of fire regime variables (fire
   severity and time since previous fire) and environmental gradients on
   post-fire regeneration would shift as seedlings developed.
   LocationSouth-eastern Australia.
   MethodsFollowing a large (>59,000ha) summer wildfire in 2009, we sampled
   131 sites (61 burnt) annually for four years (2009-2012), representing
   the range of environmental conditions in which E. regnans occurs. We
   analysed the effect of fire severity, time since fire and environmental
   variables on early regeneration processes critical for post-fire species
   distributions: seedling establishment, seedling density and growth
   through different height stages (10cm, 25cm, 50cm and 200cm).
   ResultsThe regeneration niche of E. regnans was defined by different
   factors at different stages of development. Initially, seedlings
   established prolifically on burnt sites, regardless of severity. Three
   years into the regeneration process, high-severity fire became the
   dominant driver of seedling persistence and growth over 25cm. Growth
   over 50cm was dependent on environmental conditions relating to
   elevation and precipitation.
   Main conclusionsOur results describe how fire occurrence, fire severity
   and environmental gradients affected seedling establishment, persistence
   and growth. The dynamic constraints on regeneration likely reflect
   temporal changes in the biotic and abiotic environment and variation in
   resource requirements during the early post-fire years. Our findings
   will enable more accurate forecasts of species distributions to assist
   forest conservation in the face of global changes in climate and fire
   regimes.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{356-362}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Legacies of previous land use may affect ecosystem recovery after the
   specific land use has ceased. Determining which legacies do limit
   ecosystem recovery is critical to perform effective ecological
   restoration. Pine (Pinus spp.) plantations have replaced various natural
   habitats including woodlands, shrublands and grasslands worldwide.
   Following pine tree removal, the restoration of these habitats may be
   complicated by pine plantation legacies. In this study, we tested three
   factors that may constrain grassland recovery in a former pine
   plantation following burning in an inland sand dune region in Hungary.
   We evaluated the effects of pine litter removal, native grass seeding
   and the presence of invasive Asclepias syriaca on vegetation composition
   during seven years of recovery using generalised linear mixed effect
   models and non-metric multidimensional scaling. We found that litter
   removal did not facilitate grassland regeneration. Grass seeding led to
   a fast recovery of grass cover, but negatively affected the abundance of
   unseeded target species. The presence of Asclepias had only transient
   effects on seeded grasses but positively affected unseeded target
   species richness. We conclude that sand grasslands have high restoration
   potential in burnt pine plantations despite the presence of several land
   use legacies. We found no evidence that pine litter or the presence of
   Asclepias would negatively influence grassland recovery, which implies
   that their removal is not necessary for a successful restoration. We
   suggest that moderate seeding densities of native grasses need to be
   applied to avoid the suppression of other target species. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Peatland ground layer species composition is intricately tied to
   ecosystem function (for example, carbon storage). As the primary
   disturbance in boreal bogs, wildfire selectively removes the ground
   layer vegetation, creating heterogeneous habitat conditions and
   initiating succession. However, the successional trajectory of the
   ground layer community following fire is poorly understood. Here we
   assess spatial and temporal changes in community composition along a
   chronosequence of post-fire bogs (1-105 years since fire) in north
   central Alberta, Canada. We established vegetation plots in 13 bogs and
   repeatedly monitored them from 2003-2006. We found three phases of the
   post-fire bog community, grading from pioneer true moss (for example,
   Polytrichum strictum) dominance soon post-fire (< 10 ysf) to persistent
   Sphagnum dominance in mature sites (20-80 ysf) with partial replacement
   by feathermosses (for example, Pleurozium schreberi) in older bogs (> 80
   ysf). Mature bogs dominated by Sphagnum fuscum had the greatest species
   richness, although species evenness was low. Spatial heterogeneity of
   ground layer community composition was bimodal, peaking approximately 10
   ysf (co-occurrence of true mosses and Sphagnum) and more than 80 ysf
   when feathermosses encroach and break-up Sphagnum dominance, resulting
   in inverse relationships of community species richness and diversity
   along the post-fire recovery gradient. Based on these results, we
   develop a conceptual model of post-fire bog recolonization and
   succession, in which microtopography, soil moisture, and combustion
   severity interact, thereby presenting the first comprehensive
   description of the spatio-temporal post-fire successional trajectory of
   the bog ground layer.}},

Abstract = {{Soil collected from 38 sites on Kangaroo Island in South Australia,

   mallee, was subject ex situ to both smoke aerosol and heat treatment to
   simulate burning. Further soil from a subset of 29 of the sites was left
   untreated as a control. A total of 113 native plant species and 50
   introduced species germinated across all sites. Fifty-three of the
   native plant species that germinated were absent in the above-ground
   vegetation, including twelve rare or threatened species, and three
   species previously unrecorded from Kangaroo Island. Fourteen native
   species and six introduced species germinated in heat plus smoke treated
   soil but not in untreated soil from the same sites. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling ordination indicated differences in native
   species composition between sites with a long history of sustained
   livestock grazing ({''}grazed{''} sites) and largely ungrazed sites
   ({''}ungrazed{''} sites). On average, significantly more native species
   germinated from treated soil sampled from ``ungrazed{''} sites than were
   found in the standing vegetation, while for ``grazed{''} sites this
   difference was not significant. This indicates the greater potential for
   post-fire regeneration of native vegetation from the soil seed bank of
   ungrazed sites than from that of long grazed sites. Both ``ungrazed{''}
   and ``grazed{''} sites contained weeds in their soil seed banks,

   indicated that competition from weeds is potentially a problem when fire

Abstract = {{Land use and fire exclusion have contributed to an increase in ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest extent and density in west-central Idaho.
   Open areas within ponderosa pine forests are decreasing, thus reducing
   habitat for the endemic northern Idaho ground squirrel (NIDGS;
   Urocitellus brunneus brunneus). In 2000, the NIDGS was listed on the
   Endangered Species Act as threatened in part due to habitat loss.
   Therefore, recovery plans encourage the use of burning to expand meadows
   and open corridors. We gathered data on habitat attributes altered by
   prescribed fall burning at three sites selected for habitat restoration.
   Each site was divided into two units: a CONTROL unit occupied by the
   NIDGS and a BURN unit not occupied by the NIDGS. We sought to assess
   whether the prescribed fall burning fulfilled management goals and
   generated habitat features similar to CONTROL conditions that are
   suitable for the NIDGS. Data were collected before the fall prescribed
   burn and one and two years post-burn. Before the prescribed burn, BURN
   units had higher tree densities and canopy cover than CONTROL units;
   however, the prescribed fall burn did not reduce tree density or canopy
   cover one year later. Understory height in the BURN unit decreased
   slightly post-burn, approaching CONTROL conditions. Majority of
   understory characteristics were similar between CONTROL and BURN units
   before, one, and two years after the burn, but understory community
   structure remained strongly dissimilar. This study preliminarily
   examines NIDGS habitat and is the first paper to evaluate the effects of
   prescribed burning as restoration practices to create NIDGS habitat. Key
   habitat attributes associated with NIDGS presence include tree canopy
   cover, understory height and community structure, and litter depth.
   Management goals were not attained within the stated timeline, one year
   post-burn, or even two years after prescribed burn was implemented.
   Based on our results, managers should consider extending the timeframe
   for restoration goal achievement and perhaps modifying goals to include
   changes in tree canopy cover, understory height and community structure,
   and litter depth. Future efforts should monitor beyond two years
   post-fire, focus on long-term effects of prescribed burning, and examine
   how repeat burns may help attain habitat restoration goals. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is commonly used for vegetation management. Whereas
   effects on vegetation are apparent, effects of these burns on
   ground-dwelling invertebrates are not. Land snails are especially
   susceptible to burns. Snail loss occurs directly from burns, but may
   also occur post-burn because of altered habitat conditions, although
   post-burn loss has not previously been tested. We used a field
   experiment to investigate snail survival and factors affecting survival
   in post-burn habitats. We exposed snails (Discidae: Anguispira
   alternata) to combinations of intact leaf litter, wood shelters, burned
   leaf litter, charred wood and ash added to leaf litter, to simulate a
   variety of post-burn conditions. Half of the replicates were watered
   every 3 d, which allowed detection of desiccation effects in comparison
   to ambient water conditions. The on-going drought resulted in high snail
   mortality. Watering increased survival and, as a consequence, growth.
   Snail mortality was higher in habitats with burned leaves and/or wood
   than in unburned habitats. Higher temperatures and rapid initial
   mortality in burned habitats, and increased survival with watering,
   indicated that the major cause of post-fire mortality was desiccation,
   rather than starvation. Contrary to expectations, snails in burned-leaf
   habitats grew more than snails in unburned habitats, and this greater
   growth was associated with higher soil pH. Snails surviving fires in
   burned woodland areas likely have high post-burn mortality. Our
   experiment highlights the negative impacts of burned woodland habitats
   on some nontarget organisms and indicates that prescribed burns should
   be avoided during exceptionally dry conditions.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{447}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Decades of fire suppression, logging, and overgrazing have led to
   increased densities of small diameter trees which have been associated
   with decreases in biodiversity, reduced habitat quality for wildlife
   species, degraded foraging conditions for ungulates, and more frequent
   and severe wildfires. In response, land managers are implementing forest
   restoration treatments using prescribed fire and thinning to mitigate
   the risk of catastrophic wildfires and improve habitat conditions for a
   variety of wildlife species. We monitored habitat selection by female
   mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in relation to forest restoration
   treatments and wildfires in northern New Mexico in 2015. Our specific
   objectives were to assess changes in forage abundance and determine
   habitat selection patterns of mule deer in relation to recent wildfires,
   forest restoration treatments, including duration of the post-treatment
   recovery, and other habitat characteristics. Herbaceous forage biomass
   was greater in wildfire-burned areas than in untreated areas or those
   treated with prescribed burns or thinning. Oak forage biomass was
   greater in wildfire-burned areas compared to prescribed burns, forest
   thinning, and untreated areas. However, thinned areas tended to have
   higher oak forage biomass than untreated areas. Mule deer selected for
   areas burned by prescribed fire and generally avoided wildfire-burned
   and thinned areas < 5 years old. Mule deer strongly selected for thinned
   areas a 5 years old. At both the landscape and home-range scale,
   grasslands were avoided during most seasons, pinyon-juniper woodlands
   were selected in winter, and oak vegetation and mixed-conifer forests
   were selected during summer. Our data suggests that mule deer may
   benefit from recent prescribed burns and older forest thinning, but the
   duration of post-treatment vegetation recovery influences the strength
   and direction of selection. Knowledge of the short- and long-term
   effects of restoration treatments will provide managers with the means
   to make more informed decisions regarding implementation of forest
   restoration and other vegetation treatments intended to benefit mule
   deer.}},

Abstract = {{Following severe wildfires, managing fire hazard by removing dead trees
   (post-fire logging) is an important issue globally. Data informing these
   management actions are relatively scarce, particularly how fuel loads
   differ by post-fire logging intensity within different environmental
   settings. In mixed-evergreen forests of Oregon, USA, we quantified fuel
   profiles 3-4 years after stand-replacement fire - assessing three
   post-fire logging intensities (0, 25-75, or >75\% basal area cut) across
   two climatic settings (mesic coastal, drier interior). Stand-replacement
   fire consumed similar to 17\% of aboveground biomass. Post-fire logging
   significantly reduced standing dead biomass, with high-intensity
   treatment leaving a greater proportion (28\%) of felled biomass on site
   compared with moderate-intensity treatment (14\%) because of less
   selective tree felling. A significant relationship between logging
   intensity and resulting surface fuels (per-hectare increase of 0.4-1.2Mg
   per square metre of basal area cut) indicated a broadly applicable
   predictive tool for management. Down wood cover increased by 3-5 times
   and became more spatially homogeneous after logging. Post-fire logging
   altered the fuel profile of early-seral stands (standing material
   removed or transferred, short-term increase in surface fuels, likely
   reduction in future large fuel accumulation), with moderate-intensity
   and unlogged treatments yielding surface fuel loads consistent with
   commonly prescribed levels, and high-intensity treatment resulting in
   greater potential need for follow-up fuel treatments.}},

Abstract = {{A chaparral and pine biosequence established in 1946 was burned in a
   wildfire in 2002. Thorough studies of the soil environments during the
   previous two decades established a baseline for comparison of post-fire
   changes. Aboveground vegetation was reduced to charred stems, and litter
   layers were combusted to white ash and charred material. Nevertheless,
   during the first year after the fire, runoff and erosion were minimal
   because biotically produced macropores maintained high infiltration
   rates. Loss of cover and plant transpiration made the soil warmer and
   moister. Combustion of organic matter mineralized constituent cations,
   increasing base cation concentrations in soil solutions and solid phases
   within the first few months after the fire. The pH, C, and N also
   increased in the soil, and the biological environment was extensively
   altered. Surface-active macrofauna increased, though seasonal patterns
   of abundance were unchanged. Post-fire fungal communities were
   distinctly different from pre-fire communities and were more similar to
   each other than were pre-fire communities. Overall, many of the wildfire
   impacts appear to be of short duration. Within 6 mo, original species
   were resprouting or emerging as seedlings, and most soil chemical,
   physical, and biological properties were either similar to pre-fire
   conditions or were rapidly returning toward them.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean region, long-term post-fire soil N dynamics may be
   relevant in the stabilisation of soil organic matter and N cycling in
   the plant-soil system. Post-fire recycling of N may be retained by the
   retention of N in physically and/or chemically protected fractions of
   soil organic matter. We studied the allocation of post-fire N-15-tracer
   among different soil organic matter fractions (coarse sand, fine sand,
   coarse silt and fine silt + clay) and N-15-tracer dynamics for 12 years
   after prescribed fires in three different Mediterranean plant
   communities (grassland, mixed shrub-grassland and shrubland). We
   selected 6 plots for each community and we set experimental fires.
   Directly after the fires, we applied (NF4+)-N-15-N and we monitored the
   fate of N-15-tracer over a period of 12 years. For this purpose, we
   carried out a physical size fractionation and we analysed the
   biochemical recalcitrance of N and N-15 by acid hydrolysis in the size
   fractions obtained. In both burned and unburned plots the finest soil
   particles (<20 mu m) accounted for most soil N. Fire promoted N
   increases in the medium size fractions while the N pool in the finest
   and coarsest fractions did not change after the fires. Interestingly,
   N-15-tracer was quickly incorporated into fine fractions from which, in
   the case of plant communities free of legumes, it was remobilised in the
   following years. Fire did not promote changes in recalcitrant N, but
   shrubland showed marked decreases in N recalcitrance 6 years after the
   fires. Despite the fact that the primary effects on soil fractions were
   detected just after the fires, these persisted for 12 years post-fire.
   Newly incorporated N-15-tracer was less recalcitrant than total N and,
   surprisingly, fine fractions had very low recalcitrant N-15 values,
   similar to the coarse fractions. Apparently, the N transformations in
   the finest fraction (<20 mu m) were mainly regulated by the quality of
   the N-15 compounds retained in the fraction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fires play a crucial role mediating species interactions in the
   Mediterranean Basin, with one prominent example being the nursing effect
   of post-fire resprouting shrubs on tree recruits, which then outcompete
   their benefactors throughout succession. Yet, the community structuring
   role of resprouting shrubs as potential facilitators of post-fire
   recruiting subshrub species, which are commonly outcompeted in late
   post-fire stages, has been overlooked. The aims of this work were to
   investigate (i) whether proximity to resprouting shrubs increased the
   demographic performance of a fire-adapted carnivorous subshrub and (ii)
   whether mature shrubs negatively affected the performance of established
   plants through interference with prey capture.
   To evaluate the facilitative effects of resprouting shrubs, we sowed
   seeds of Drosophyllum lusitanicum, a carnivorous, seeder pyrophyte, into
   two microhabitats in recently burned heathland patches defined by
   proximity to resprouting shrubs. We monitored key demographic rates of
   emerged seedlings for 2 years. To test for competitive effects of shrubs
   on plant performance at a later habitat regeneration stage, we placed
   greenhouse-reared, potted plants into distinct microhabitats in
   neighboring burned and unburned heathland patches and monitored prey
   capture. Both experiments were performed in the Aljibe Mountains at the
   Northern Strait of Gibraltar and were replicated in 2 years.
   Resprouting shrubs significantly improved survival, juvenile size and
   flowering probability compared with open microhabitats, and had no
   significantly negative effects on the growth of recruits. Prey capture
   was significantly lower in unburned heathland patches compared with
   burned ones, thus partly explaining the decrease in survival of
   Drosophyllum individuals in mature heathlands. However, microhabitat did
   not affect prey capture. Our findings suggest that not only periodic
   fires, removing biomass in mature stands, but also resprouting
   neighbors, increasing establishment success after fire, may be important
   for the viability of early successional pyrophytes.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to halt the decline of the northern bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus; bobwhite) across its distribution have had limited success.
   Understanding bobwhite habitat requirements across the annual cycle and
   at varying scales is essential to aid efforts to conserve bobwhites. We
   monitored radio-tagged bobwhites from 2016 to 2018 on a 165-km(2)portion
   of Fort Bragg Military Installation in the Sandhills physiographic
   region of North Carolina, USA, to determine factors influencing
   non-breeding bobwhite habitat selection at multiple scales. We used
   generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized linear mixed models to
   assess bobwhite habitat selection at the microsite scale (the immediate
   vicinity of an animal) and the macrosite scale (across the study area),
   respectively, by comparing used points to available random points. At
   the microsite scale, bobwhites strongly selected areas with greater
   woody understory cover. Also, bobwhite selection increased with greater
   forb and switchcane (Arundinaria tecta) cover, but this effect plateaued
   at 65\% forb cover and 50\% switchcane cover. At the macrosite scale,
   bobwhites generally selected areas with greater understory cover within
   a 200-m radius but avoided areas with >55\% understory cover; these
   areas primarily were located in the core areas of drainages with
   extensive ericaceous vegetation. Bobwhites selected areas with 3-6
   m(2)/ha hardwood basal area in uplands, potentially because of the
   availability of mast, but avoided uplands when pine (Pinusspp.) or
   hardwood basal area exceeded 20 m(2)/ha or 12 m(2)/ha, respectively,
   likely because high basal area is associated with increased shading and
   subsequent loss of understory cover. In addition, bobwhites selected
   uplands 1 growing season (>= 2-month period falling entirely between 1
   Apr and 1 Oct) post-fire regardless of burn season. Overall, managers
   seeking to improve habitat quality for bobwhites in longleaf pine (Pinus
   palustris) woodlands should employ management practices that maintain
   available woody understory across the landscape to provide cover during
   the non-breeding season. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Salvage logging practices in recently burned forests often have direct
   effects on species associated with dead trees, particularly
   cavity-nesting birds. As such, evaluation of postfire management
   practices on nest survival rates of cavity nesters is necessary for
   determining conservation strategies. We monitored 1,797 nests of 6
   cavity-nesting bird species: Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis),
   hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (P.
   arcticus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), western bluebird (Sialia
   mexicana), and mountain bluebird (S. currucoides) from 1994 to 2004 in
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), mixed-severity burned forests
   (partially logged and unlogged) of Idaho, USA. Based on a priori
   hypotheses, we modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of nests as a function
   of abiotic (temperature, precipitation), temporal (time since fire,
   calendar year) and biotic factors (distance to unburned forest, nest
   height, and tree harvest {[}partial-salvage logging vs. unlogged]).
   Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, other than direct effects of
   salvage logging, affected daily survival rates of breeding
   cavity-nesting birds. Hairy woodpecker was the only species in which
   partial-salvage logging had a measurable, negative impact on DSR.
   Managers implementing carefully planned salvage logging prescriptions
   that include both unlogged reserves and partially logged areas can
   expect to maintain habitat for successfully breeding cavity-nesting
   birds of the interior northwestern United States. Our results also
   suggest that nest survival for some species of cavity-nesting birds

   sources of nest predators. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Structurally complex forest provides important habitat for a diverse
   array of vertebrate fauna. Frequent fire can simplify forest structure,
   though topographic mitigation of fire effects could potentially preserve
   structurally more complex habitat within certain topographic locations
   of fire prone landscapes. Our study assessed whether the effects of fire
   frequency on forest structure (tree hollows, log volume, vegetation
   complexity) varied with topographic position. The effect of wildfire
   severity and intensive logging were also examined. Frequent fire reduced
   vegetation cover on ridges, but not in gullies. The risk of collapse
   (i.e. presence of fire scars) increased for large trees on frequently
   burnt ridges, but remained suppressed in gullies. Crown fire reduced
   hollow presence in dead trees (i.e. snags), but increased hollow
   presence in trees with a healthy crown. The volume of extensively
   decomposed logs was three times greater in gullies than ridges, but was
   unaffected by fire frequency. Intensive logging reduced the number of
   hollow bearing trees and increased the volume of extensively decomposed
   logs, though future declines in log volume are predicted due to
   bottlenecks in log input. Our results suggest that gullies may play a
   critical role in preserving structurally complex stands within
   frequently burnt temperate eucalypt forests. Protecting gullies from
   land clearing and intensive logging is likely to be an important step in
   maintaining key habitat features and associated fauna in these

Abstract = {{British vegetation is estimated to contain 113.8 million tC, 80 per cent
   of which is in forests and woodlands (91.9 million tC). Sitka spruce
   plantations, although covering 21.4 per cent of the forest/woodland
   area, contain only 8.2 per cent of the forest/woodland carbon, because
   the plantations are young and have an average of only 14.1 tC ha(-1).
   Broadleaved woodlands in Britain have an average of 61.9 tC ha(-1) and
   contain 46.8 per cent of the total carbon in all vegetation. A breakdown
   is given of the carbon density (tC ha(-1)) and content of different tree
   species. A carbon density map of Britain highlights the concentration of
   carbon in the broadleaved woodlands in southern England and in the large
   conifer plantations in southern Scotland and northern England.
   Carbon storage in the trees, products, litter and soil can be evaluated
   in terms of long-term equilibrium storage or short-term rate of storage.
   These two components vary among forest types in Britain and globally.
   Plantations harvested at the time of maximum mean annual increment (MAI)
   will not store as much carbon as mature, old-growth forests on the same
   site unless they have long-lasting products and/or are very fast
   growing. Maximum equilibrium carbon storage is generally achieved by
   harvesting at the time of maximum MAI when the lifetime of products
   exceeds the time to maximum MAI. Undisturbed peatlands sequester CO2 and
   emit CH4, and may be greenhouse neutral. When peatlands are drained and
   planted with trees, they stop emitting CH4 and store carbon in the
   trees, forest litter, forest soil and wood products. However, these
   greenhouse gas `gains' are offset by the oxidation to CO2 of the pear,
   and the gains are exceeded by CO2 losses when 20-40 cm depth of peat has
   been oxidized. Forests in Britain are currently sequestering 1.5-1.7
   million tC a(-1) in trees, 0.3-0.5 tC a(-1) in litter and 0.5 million tC
   a(-1) in wood products, totalling about 2.5 million tC, equivalent to
   about 1.5 per cent of the carbon currently emitted by burning fossil
   fuels in the UK. In order to maintain the current forest carbon sink,
   the forest area needs to continue to expand at about 25000 ha a(-1) of
   upland conifers or 10000 ha a(-1) of poplars on good land.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency, extent, and severity of wildfire strongly influence the
   structure and function of ecosystems. Mixed-severity fire regimes are
   the most complex and least understood fire regimes, and variability of
   fire severity can occur at fine spatial and temporal scales, depending
   on previous disturbance history, topography, fuel continuity, vegetation
   type, and weather. During high fire weather in 2013, a complex of
   mixed-severity wildfires burned across multiple ownerships within the
   Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of southwestern Oregon where northern spotted
   owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) demographics were studied since 1990. A
   year prior to these wildfires, high-resolution, remotely sensed forest
   structural information derived from light detection and ranging (lidar)
   data was acquired for an area that fully covered the extent of these
   fires. To quantify wildfire impact on northern spotted owl
   nesting/roosting habitat, we fit a relative habitat suitability model
   based on pre-fire locations used for nesting and roosting, and forest
   structure variables developed from 2012 lidar data. Our pre-fire habitat
   suitability model predicted nesting/roosting locations well, and
   variable response functions followed known resource selection patterns.
   These forests had typical characteristics of old-growth forest, with
   high density of large live trees, high canopy cover, and complex
   structure in canopy height. We projected the pre-fire model onto lidar
   data collected two months post-fire to produce a post-fire suitability
   map, which indicated that >93\% of pre-fire habitat that burned at high
   severity was no longer suitable forest for nesting and roosting. We also
   quantified the probability that pre-fire nesting/roosting habitat would
   burn at each severity class (unburned/low, low, moderate, high).
   Pre-fire nesting/roosting habitat had lower probability of burning at
   moderate or high severity compared to other forest types under high
   burning conditions. Our results indicate that northern spotted owl
   habitat can buffer the negative effects of climate change by enhancing
   biodiversity and resistance to high-severity fires, which are predicted
   to increase in frequency and extent with climate change. Within this
   region, protecting large blocks of old forests could be an integral
   component of management plans that successfully maintain variability of
   forests in this mixed-ownership and mixed-severity fire regime landscape
   and enhance conservation of many species.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled burning is often used to improve plant structure on

   post-fire grazing to reappearing desirable plant species may be a

   essential for the re-establishment of the photosynthetic leaf area. We
   studied if post-bum defoliation affects the number of axillary buds
   and/or their metabolic activity in Pea ligularis. Nassella tenuis (both
   desirable plant species) and Amelichloa amhigua (undesirable plant
   species). We found that the treatments limited neither bud production
   nor their metabolic activity. The greatest number of total and viable
   buds in the studied plant species was recorded at the vegetative stage.
   Pea ligularis had the lowest bud number per tiller but the greatest per

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Natural area managers use fire and grazing to achieve nature
   conservation/production goals and to prevent the loss of life and
   property. Yet, little is known of the effects of post-fire grazing on
   fuel load and the proportion of days on which fire can be sustained
   (fire potential). This knowledge could help managers in planning
   interventions to achieve their goals.
   2. At seven sites in Tasmania, Australia, including sedgeland, heathy
   forest and grassland, fire potential and fuel load were measured before,
   and for 2 years after fire. Measurements were made in burning, fencing
   and burning plus fencing treatments, and in control quadrats.
   3. Burning followed by grazing, largely by native vertebrates, resulted
   in lower fuel loads than either grazing by itself or burning by itself.
   A new steady state was established in two grasslands. Fire potential at
   the oligotrophic sites was largely a function of time elapsed since the
   last fire, while at grassy sites was increased by grazing without fire,
   but depressed or slightly increased by grazing after burning.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Effects of grazing after burning on
   flammability are not predictable from the single or additive effects of
   grazing and burning, varying between vegetation type and environment. In
   highland grassy ecosystems fire potential can be reduced by excluding
   grazing animals after fire, while in scleromorphic ecosystems grazing
   after fire does not affect fuel or fire potential. Intense grazing after
   fire can cause an, often desirable, shift from tussock to lawn
   grassland. Burning and subsequent grazing of tussock grassland
   vegetation in the lowlands may reduce the chance of wildfire damaging
   property and conservation/production values, while in highland tussock
   grassland burning followed by grazing will be largely ineffective in
   reducing the already low chance of such damaging fire.}},

Abstract = {{The fires of summer 2003 in south-eastern Australia burnt tens of
   thousands or hectares of treeless alpine landscape. Here, we examine the
   environmental impact of these fires, using data from the Bogong High
   Plains area of Victoria, and the Snowy Mountains region of New South
   Wales. Historical and biophysical evidence suggests that in Australian
   alpine environments, extensive fires occur only in periods of extended
   regional drought, and when severe local fire weather coincides with
   multiple ignitions in the surrounding montane forests.
   Dendrochronological evidence indicates that large fires have occurred
   approximately every 50-100 years over the past 400 years. Post-fire
   monitoring of vegetation in grasslands and heathlands indicates that
   most alpine species regenerate rapidly after fire, with >90\% of species
   present I year after fire. Some keystone species in some plant
   communities, however, had not regenerated after 3 years. The responses
   of alpine fauna to the 2003 fires were variable. The core habitat
   (closed heathland) of several Vulnerable small mammals was extensively
   burnt. Some mammals experienced Substantial falls in populations, others
   experienced substantial increases. Unburnt patches of vegetation are
   critical to faunal recovery from fire. There was, however, no evidence
   of local extinction. We conclude that infrequent extensive fires are a
   feature of alpine Australia. For both the flora and fauna, there is no
   quantitative evidence that the 2003 fires were an ecological disaster,
   and we conclude that the flora and fauna of alpine Australia are highly
   resilient to infrequent, large, intense fires.}},

Abstract = {{An early study analysing the effects of competition from Cistus
   monspeliensis-dominated shrub canopy on Pinus halepensis saplings, both
   colonising a recently burnt area, has been extended in order to test
   initial predictions. Inter-specific competition effects on P. halepensis
   were experimentally analysed by a shrub thinning-out treatment carried
   out 1 year after fire. The extension of the recorded period confirmed
   (i) a significant increase in height, and (ii) the lack of variation in
   density of P. halepensis saplings when the shrub layer was removed. In
   contrast, the increase in relative growth rate in height (RGRh) and the
   decrease in mortality recorded during early post-fire stages for treated
   units did not persist in subsequent years. These two treatment-induced
   effects disappeared 1 year after the shrub clearing (29 months after
   fire). It is hypothesised that this time should represent a culminating
   point in the inter-specific competition established between Cistus and
   Pinus saplings simultaneously colonising recently disturbed areas and be
   a critical period for pine sapling survival. After this time, a
   reduction in relatively short-lived Cistus populations and an increase
   in R halepensis abundance should be expected in the community. It is
   concluded that a shrub-clearing treatment could be recommendable if the
   initial post-fire pine sapling density is not high enough to
   successfully face the early critical competitive period. Consequences of
   early shrub competition on forest productivity during mature phases are

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used in southeastern pine forests to maintain
   desirable forest conditions and provides herbaceous understory plant
   communities for wildlife. However, it is unclear how time-since-fire
   affects the short-term response of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) to
   prescribed fire. We examined use of recently burned pine stands by
   female eastern wild turkeys (M. g. silvestris) immediately following
   prescribed fire in a pine-dominated landscape managed with frequent
   fire. We developed several models to best predict the influence of
   time-since-fire and month of fire application on turkey use of burned
   areas. We also assessed the spatial behavior of turkeys when using
   recent burns to determine if distance to escape cover affected turkey
   use of recently burned areas. Female turkeys used burned areas
   immediately after fire and probability of use increased until 141 days
   post-fire and then declined until 250 days post fire when data
   collection stopped. Response of turkeys to recent burns depended on the
   month of prescribed fire application; probability of use was greater for
   areas burned in February and during the growing season (April and May).
   Turkey use of space within burned areas declined as distance to
   surrounding unburned areas increased, suggesting that turkeys favor the
   edge of burned and unburned areas which could serve as escape cover.
   However, the effect of distance to the perimeter of burned stand
   decreased as time-since-fire increased. Our findings suggest that
   turkeys are less likely to use areas burned in early winter (e.g.,
   December) than late winter (e.g., February), and are more likely to use
   space near edges of burned areas than the interior. We recommend
   managers in southeastern pine-dominated ecosystems apply dormant season
   fires in late winter and apply early spring growing season fires as
   needed to meet forest management objectives. Turkeys used burned areas
   immediately following prescribed fire, but traded-off exploitation of
   foraging opportunities by using space near escape cover. Applying
   prescribed fire on smaller patches in checkerboard fashion may enhance
   turkey use of the entirety of a burn unit, and future research should
   seek to delineate other variables influencing how turkeys use recently
   burned areas. We recommend applying prescribed fire to patches smaller
   than those burned on our study sites at frequent (2-3) year fire-return
   intervals to increase usable space for female turkeys throughout the
   reproductive period. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires affect vast areas of Mediterranean forests, thereby triggering
   changes in hydrological and geomorphological processes that can
   negatively affect both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although
   several studies have evaluated the post-fire hydrological and erosive
   response in burnt forest areas, an important knowledge gap remains with
   respect to nutrient mobilization by overland flow. To address this gap,
   a recently burnt area was selected near the Ermida village
   (north-central Portugal). The study area was instrumented shortly after
   a wildfire that occurred in July 2010, to evaluate the export of
   dissolved (nitrate - NO3-N and orthophosphate - PO4-P) and total
   nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) forms by overland flow. This was done
   in two burnt eucalyptus plantations due to their contrasting slope
   aspects (south-east vs. north-west). Bounded micro-plots were installed
   in August 2010 and monitored over two years. During this period,
   overland flow samples were collected on a 1-to 2-weekly basis, depending
   on the occurrence of rain. Results showed that the north west-facing
   slope (BEN) presented higher nutrient losses than the south east-facing
   slope (BE-S), contradicting the findings of previous studies in the
   Mediterranean region. A logging operation that had taken place at the
   BE-N site shortly before the fire might account for these findings, by
   causing soil compaction and/or reducing the protective vegetation and
   litter cover. TN and TP exports were particularly pronounced during the
   first four months following the wildfire. After this initial period,
   further peaks in TN and TP exports occurred sporadically, mainly
   associated to intense rainfall events. The observed mid-term post-fire
   nutrient losses not only suggested a threat to the soil nutrient balance
   of Mediterranean eucalypt forests but also a potential risk of
   eutrophication of downstream water bodies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Carabid diversity may provide remarkable indicators of habitat type. We
   tested how habitat affinities of ground beetles correspond to
   restoration success for black oak barrens previously assessed for
   understory flora. Three different restoration techniques were applied to
   set back succession of encroaching woodlands and to open the habitat:
   selective canopy tree removal favoring 5\% to 30\% tree canopy cover,
   removal of thick forest floor leaf litter, or prescribed fire. All
   methods were set within 35 x 35 m plots spread across 10 glacial kames,
   which are mounds of sand and gravel deposited by melting ice sheets.
   Baseline surveys using pitfall traps obtained 21 species of Carabidae,
   almost all of which were characterized as woodland species. Imposing
   disturbance increased species numbers to 28, with 11 newly discovered
   and four not found in the resurvey. Of the new inhabitants, four species
   known to use grasslands and one woodland edge species had become common,
   while numerous woodland species declined in abundance. This marked
   community change in Carabidae occurred primarily after select canopy
   tree removal, which was the treatment that best shifted the forest back
   to a mosaic of open oak sand barrens and grassland. Prescribed burns
   only increased one woodland edge species that also appeared after canopy
   thinning and leaf litter removal. Change in the carabid species
   indicated success in shifting habitat and, concurrently, shifting
   understory plants increased diversity of carabids towards species that

Abstract = {{Post-fire management can have an additional impact on the ecosystem; in
   some cases, even more severe than the fire. Salvage logging (SL) is a
   common practice in most fire-affected areas. The management of burnt
   wood can determine microclimatic conditions and seriously affect soil
   properties. In some cases, the way of doing it, using heavy machinery,
   and the vulnerability of soils to erosion and degradation can make this
   management potentially aggressive to soil. Research was done in ``Sierra
   de Mariola Natural Park{''} (E Spain). A forest fire (>500 ha) occurred
   in July 2012. In February 2013, SL treatment was applied in a part of
   the affected forest. Plots for monitoring this effect were installed in
   this area and in a similar nearby area where no treatment was done, used
   as control (C). Soil samplings were done immediately after treatment and
   every 6 months during two years. Some soil properties were analysed,
   including organic matter (OM) conteht, nitrogen (N) available
   phosphorous (P) basal soil respiration (BSR), microbial biomass carbon
   (C-mic), bulk density (BD), water repellency (WR), aggregate stability
   (AS) and field capacity (FC). SL treatment caused an increase in BD, a
   decrease of AS, FC, OM and N. In the control area, in general the soil
   properties remained constant across the 2 years of monitoring, and the
   microbial parameters (BSR and C-mic), initially affected by the fire,
   recovered faster in C than in the SL area. Plant recovery also showed
   some differences between treatments. No significant differences were
   observed in the number of plant species recorded (richness) comparing C
   versus SL plots, but the number of individuals of each species
   (evenness) was significantly higher in C plots. In conclusion, we can
   affirm that for the conditions of this study case, SL had a negative
   effect on the soil-plant system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Postfire restoration practices encompass those which aim to reduce

   Contour-felled log debris (CFD) and log erosion barriers (LEB) are two
   techniques used worldwide on hillslopes after wildfires in order to
   avoid soil erosion. In this context, it is essential to evaluate how
   these restoration techniques can affect soil properties by increasing or
   decreasing wildfire impacts. The effects on several physico-chemical and
   biological soil parameters were here investigated by comparing three
   differently treated post-fire zones. Three randomly 20 x 20 m
   distributed plots were set up five years after wildfire in the burned
   and contour-felled log debris areas (CFD plots), three others in the
   burned and log erosion barriers area (LEB plots) and three others in the
   burned and unmanaged plots (BNa plots). Three more plots were set up in
   an unburned area close to the burned area (UB plots). The results
   revealed that LEB and, to a lesser extent CFD, improved postfire soil
   quality, which a priori favoured helped the recovery of ecosystem
   functions. Our results also indicate greater efficacy of LEB and CFD in
   retaining sediments by limiting loss of nutrients, which is considered
   essential to recover vegetation after a wildfire. Post-fire restoration

Abstract = {{Context. Prescribed burning is widely adopted as a
   conservation-management tool, with priorities largely being the
   protection of fire-sensitive plant communities, threatened fauna habitat
   and minimising the risk and impacts of broad-scale wildfire. However, an
   improved understanding of the ecological mechanisms that underpin
   species responses to fire will assist the development and refinement of
   prescribed-burning practice.
   Aims. To examine the effect of fire on burrow-system occupancy and
   breeding success at different spatial and temporal scales for a
   threatened skink, Liopholis kintorei.
   Methods. Experimental burns simulating different fire types (clean burn,
   patchy burn and no burn) were conducted at 30 L. kintorei burrow systems
   that were selected from within a 75-ha focal study area. Burrow-system
   occupancy was monitored daily for 1 month, then monthly for an
   additional 3 months. Breeding success was assessed once at all 30 burrow
   systems. Eight additional 1-km(2) sites within L. kintorei habitat that
   had experienced some degree of fire 2 years earlier were selected from
   across Newhaven Wildlife Sanctuary. Burrow-system occupancy and breeding
   success of L. kintorei at these sites was assessed once.
   Key results. There was no significant effect of fire on burrow-system
   occupancy 1 month after experimental burns; however, burrow-system
   occupancy was significantly higher at unburnt sites 4 months after
   experimental burns and 2 years post-fire. Breeding success was
   significantly higher at unburnt sites than at clean-burnt and
   patchy-burnt sites.
   Conclusions. Fire adversely affects L. kintorei, as demonstrated by a
   higher proportion of unoccupied burrow systems and fewer successful
   breeding events post-fire, particularly when all ground cover is lost.
   Implications. Because fire is an inevitable and natural process within
   arid-zone spinifex grasslands, the primary habitat for L. kintorei, we
   recommend prescribed-burning practices that aim to maximise ground cover
   by reducing the frequency, intensity and size of fires. More
   specifically, we recommend fire exclusion from key sites within distinct
   localities where L. kintorei is known to be locally abundant. Depending
   on the size of these key sites, there may also be a need to construct
   strategic fire breaks within sites to ensure that any unwanted ignitions
   do not result in the loss of all vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires in mountainous areas can cause severe deforestation which
   can potentially trigger secondary natural hazards like debris falls and
   avalanches. We documented an extreme case study for the range of
   possible post-fire land cover (LC) dynamics. We investigated a 15-ha,
   steep (10 degrees-65 degrees) burnt slope in Styria (Austria) at
   elevation of 760-1130 m, which burned in 1946 and has not fully
   recovered to date. Seven 8-class legend LC maps were produced (1954,
   1966, 1973, 1982, 1998, 2004, 2009) and integrated in a vector-based
   GIS, mainly by on-screen interpretation of aerial photos. Our aim was to
   clarify how post-wildfire LC dynamics take place on a severely damaged,
   steep slope and to give a basic projection of the future vegetation
   recovery process. The pre-fire Pinus sylvestris stands have been mainly
   replaced by Picea abies and Larix decidua. Regeneration proceeded mainly
   from the base of the slope upwards. All tree species together still
   cover no more than 40\% of the slope after more than 60 years of
   recovery, while grassland communities and rock/debris areas have
   expanded. Multitemporal analysis showed a slow but steady increase in
   woodland cover. Degraded rock/debris areas, however, expanded as well
   because soil erosion and related debris flows remained active. Slope
   angle (with a threshold value of approx. 35-40 degrees) seemed to
   control whether erosion or regeneration prevailed. According to a simple
   extrapolation, the slope will not reach its former condition before
   2070. This extreme disturbance window of more than 120 years is owed to
   the steepness of the slope and to the shallow soils on dolomitic bedrock
   that were severely damaged by the fire. The neglect of any game fencing
   is a further factor slowing regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Does browsing by large herbivores affect forest understorey
   diversity by modifying assemblage dominance? Does fire interact with
   browsing to affect forest understorey diversity? Does this interaction
   occur via a numerically mediated or functionally moderated pathway?
   Location: Booderee National Park, Jervis Bay Territory, south-eastern
   Australia.
   Methods: We tested the interactive effects of fire and browsing by
   native herbivores on understorey plant diversity using a randomized
   blocked experiment in an open eucalypt forest. We monitored the
   percentage cover of every vascular plant species in 24 sites over four
   experimental blocks. We applied a different treatment to each of the six
   sites in the four blocks. Treatments were a factorial combination of
   three levels of herbivory treatment (open, partial exclosure, full
   exclosure) and two levels of prescribed fire treatment (burned,
   unburned).
   Results: Browsing increased plant community dominance and reduced
   evenness and diversity, but only in burned sites. Heavy browsing
   following fire created an understorey dominated by an unpalatable,
   fire-resistant fern species (bracken, Pteridium esculentum). This
   fire-browsing interaction was driven by both numerically mediated and
   functionally moderated pathways: Fire both increased local browsing
   intensity, and amplified the per-unit effect of herbivores on the plant
   community.
   Conclusions: The altered competitive environment after fire, combined
   with heavy post-fire browsing created a depauperate understorey,
   dominated by bracken. The ability of bracken to suppress the
   establishment of other plants means that, once established, this
   fern-dominated understorey may be difficult to reverse. Our results
   demonstrate the key role of fire-browsing interactions in forest
   vegetation dynamics and highlight the importance of integrating large
   herbivore management with fire planning in forest ecosystems.}},
